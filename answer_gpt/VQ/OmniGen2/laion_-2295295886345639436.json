      "question": "Does the Ancient Greek-style armor fit the characterâ€™s torso and limbs without distorting muscle contours or creating unnatural gaps or overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Ancient Greek-style armor is designed to cover the torso and limbs, and in Image B, it's depicted in a way that follows the contours of the body. The muscular structure underneath remains visible, suggesting that the armor is form-fitting and does not create unnatural gaps or overlaps. The design seems to accommodate the natural muscle shapes without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the joints of the armored limbs articulated properly, and is the sword held in a position that does not bend or stretch the arm beyond natural limits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armored limbs in Image B are segmented in a typical fashion for such armor, allowing for a range of motion. The sword is held in a ready position, with the arm not overextended or awkwardly bent. This articulation allows the character to hold the sword naturally without any apparent stress on the joints.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character holding the barbell is depicted with an even distribution across the shoulders, indicating that the barbell is balanced. Both hands grip the barbell symmetrically, and the character's posture is upright, suggesting stability and proper form.",

      "question": "Is the head proportionally aligned with the neck and upper torso in all three versions without appearing oversized, undersized, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of each character appears to be proportionate to the neck and upper torso. The heads are neither oversized nor undersized, and they are well-aligned with the body's overall proportions, reflecting a cohesive and anatomically plausible design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands in all three versions have exactly five fingers, proper joint curvature, and natural grip on the sword or barbell without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each figure's hand is designed with five fingers, and the joints are depicted to have natural curvature. The grip on both the sword and the barbell appears natural with no distortion or extra digits visible, indicating accurate representation of human anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the armor, clothing, and props consistent with a single light source and do they enhance the three-dimensional appearance without creating floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and highlights in Image B are consistent with illumination from a single light source, as they are uniformly applied in a way that accentuates the three-dimensional form of the characters, armor, and props. This ensures that all elements appear grounded and cohesive with the overall scene.",
