    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
    "explanation": "Despite the wood carving design, the gorilla's arms and legs in the edited image maintain the necessary anatomical proportions and joint structures, typical of a gorilla's physique. There is no evidence of flattening or unnatural curves that would detract from a believable representation, even when stylized in wood.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
    "explanation": "The background is characterized by wooden textures that include darker leaf shapes, which are etched into the wood surface. These elements demonstrate depth and layering, contributing to a coherent composition that integrates smoothly with the gorilla figure rather than appearing as separate or flat elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "Observation of the scattered leaves in the background reveals they are depicted in darker wood tones. Their placement appears natural, suggesting resting or slight embedding into the wooden surface, which contributes to a naturalistic setting without signs of floating or incorrect overlapping.",
    "answer": "Yes"
