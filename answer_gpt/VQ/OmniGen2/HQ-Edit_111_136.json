      "question": "Does the white chiton with gold accents on the woman’s body show natural fabric folds and lighting consistency, without visible pixelation, texture repetition, or unnatural stiffness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white chiton with gold accents appears to exhibit natural fabric folds and lighting effects. The outfit drapes smoothly around the woman's body, capturing complexity in the way light interacts with the gold accents and fabric texture. The details are consistent with a flowing garment, free from pixelation or repetitive patterns that would indicate an artificial texture or stiffness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the classical Greek-style waves and laurel leaves in the woman's hair consistent in shape, density, and lighting with the surrounding environment, and do they avoid unnatural clumping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair styled in classical Greek-style waves and adorned with laurel leaves demonstrates a sense of coherence with the scene's lighting and environment. The curls and laurel are integrated well in terms of shape and density, following a natural flow without appearing unnaturally clumped. The lighting highlights the contours appropriately, with no floating appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and animals in the background retain recognizable forms while being rendered in a golden, stylized manner consistent with classical Greek pottery art, without distorted proportions or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as trees and animals are depicted in a golden, stylistic motif reminiscent of classical Greek pottery. Their forms are preserved in a way that they are still easily recognizable, and the proportions appear accurate. This method maintains the scene's cohesion without resorting to distortion or fragmented visuals.",

      "question": "Is the sky rendered with coherent cloud formations and directional lighting that matches the overall illumination of the scene, avoiding artificial seams or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted with well-defined cloud formations that blend naturally with the scene's overall lighting, capturing a harmonious gradient. No artificial seams or inconsistent shading are evident, thus maintaining continuity with the rest of the image’s lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands and feet anatomically correct, with five fingers per hand and natural joint positioning, and does her posture reflect plausible human motion without deformation or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hands and feet appear anatomically correct, with each hand displaying five fingers. Her joints and limbs are properly aligned, and she is posed in a manner that suggests natural, plausible human motion. There is no evidence of unnatural deformation or exaggerated stretching.",
