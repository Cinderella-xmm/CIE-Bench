      "question": "Does the transition between the dog and the banana appear smooth and natural without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and the banana are distinct objects placed side by side, and there is no physical connection or transition between them to analyze. The objects do not need to have a transition as they do not naturally connect in real life. Thus, the question is not applicable to the image since there is no direct transition between the two objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the dog and the banana consistent with each other and the surrounding grass, indicating a natural light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be consistent across the dog, the banana, and the grass. The light source seems to be coming from the top, as both the dog and the banana have similar highlights and shadows on their surfaces, and the grass appears evenly lit. This suggests a unified light source, contributing to a natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the dog and the banana connect, disrupting the visual quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, there is no connection point between the dog and the banana as they are not physically touching each other. Each object preserves its individual textures - the dog's fur appears realistic and detailed, and the banana's peel retains its natural look without any disruption in visual quality between the two.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the dog and the banana remain realistic and proportional to each other, avoiding any unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana is significantly larger than the dog, which is not typically realistic given their usual sizes in real life. Chihuahuas are generally larger than bananas, so the proportions here suggest an exaggerated or playful scale rather than realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials of the dog's fur and the banana's peel retain their natural texture and appearance, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur appears soft and naturally textured, and the banana's peel shows a realistic surface with appropriate color and speckles. Both elements retain a level of detail that maintains their natural appearance, thus contributing to the realism of the respective textures.",
