      "question": "Do the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal appear to naturally integrate with the warm red and gold hues of the book and pitcher without disrupting the overall color harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure and mythical animal are placed beside a gold pitcher within a transparent cube. The gold color of the pitcher is consistent across both images, but the LEGO item's red hue isn't in harmony with the warm red tone of the book and the golden pitcher seen in Image A. It introduces a plastic, vibrant tone that contrasts with the classic and warm hues of the original setup.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and sizes of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal logically consistent with the scale of the book and pitcher, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and scale of the LEGO minifigure and animal look consistent beside the pitcher, maintaining realistic sizing that would be expected from such scale models in real life. In Image A, the book's relative size when compared to the gold pitcher suggests its realistic proportions. There is no obvious distortion in proportions in Image B when considered independently or in relation to Image A.",

      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal maintain a natural and high-quality appearance, free from any unnatural artifacts or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the LEGO minifigure and mythical animal retain their characteristic shine and texture. The LEGO material, known for its smooth surface, presents no degradation or artifact issues, maintaining a clear and detailed appearance. The pitcher's metallic sheen is consistent, reflecting light naturally.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cube appears fully intact, without any visible irregularities or broken shapes. The reflections and refraction through the glass are visually plausible, maintaining expected clarity and structural uniformity consistent with a high-quality glass enclosure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows a gradient transition from deep amber to soft cream tones. This smooth transition enhances the warm and cozy ambiance of the image, maintaining visual authenticity. The background complements the overall scene dynamics, without abrupt shifts that could disrupt its natural appearance.",
