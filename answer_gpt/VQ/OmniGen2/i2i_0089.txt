    "Question": "Q1: Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is displayed with a stylized look, as it wears glasses and posits a leap towards the camera, making it look as if the kitten is jumping out of the screen. The body of the kitten appears proportionate to its head and limbs. There are no visible unnatural distortions or artifacts that interfere with the expected anatomical structure of a cat. The perspective used enhances a 3D effect, but the proportions remain realistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the fur details around the kitten’s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's fur around the face has been rendered with smooth and consistent textures, fitting with a stylized appearance rather than high-realism. Despite the stylization, the fur retains a natural look with clear boundaries and no conspicuous unnatural patterns or loss of detail that would detract from its overall look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is depicted with a highly dynamic, leaping pose, emphasizing a jumps-out effect. While the perspective is exaggerated for visual impact, it doesn’t lead to apparent distortions or disproportionate shapes that would look unnatural. The effect is successfully achieved without breaking the kitten’s geometric coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
    "explanation": "This question does not apply to Image B. In Image B, the kitten is against a solid blue background, not a blanket. This blue background supports the virtual jumping motion effect without involving tactile material properties like a blanket. Hence, it does not introduce any artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is in a jumping pose, and its paws are prominently visible. The shape of the paws remains natural, and their placement is consistent with the leaping motion portrayed. There is no evident distortion or unrealistic deformation in the paws—instead, they complement the dynamic pose and help convey the 3D effect effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
