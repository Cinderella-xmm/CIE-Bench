    "Question": "Q1: Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the raised structures on the car's hood resemble button-like structures that are symmetrically placed on each side of the car, suggesting a design change from the original gullwing doors visible in Image A. The structures appear smooth and part of the car's design, without any visible warping or clipping, which indicate the smooth transitions from the body.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent front grille that does not resemble a traditional design. Instead, the grille has angular and segmented patterns that suggest a modern interpretation. However, this does not align with the description of a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad, as the segments do not distinctly form this shape or structure.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
    "explanation": "The interior of the car is not clearly visible in Image B; thus, it is difficult to ascertain the details about a dashboard emblem resembling a central control button.

    "explanation": "In Image B, the components such as the button-like structures on the hood, the modified grille, and the emblem appear to be fully attached to the car body. There is no visual indication of floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends; all components appear integrated with the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
