      "question": "Do the simplified versions of the red motorcycle and blue truck maintain their key features without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red motorcycle and blue truck have been transformed into a simplified, cartoon-like style. The red motorcycle retains its key features such as the aerodynamic design and color, while the blue truck maintains its boxy shape and classic truck elements. There are no signs of unnatural textures or distortions which would detract from recognizing these vehicles. This transformation appears intentional and aligns with common design practices for creating chibi or cartoon versions of real-world objects.",

      "question": "Does the rider's black gear retain its essential characteristics without unnatural alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rider in Image B has been stylized in a cartoon form but maintains essential characteristics such as the all-black suit, helmet, and riding posture. The simplification process does not introduce unnatural alterations or distortions that would obscure these key characteristics. Instead, it enhances the playful and chibi-style of the sticker design, preserving the identity of the rider.",

      "question": "Are the playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics added without breaking the visual credibility or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image employs playful touches typical of chibi or cartoon designs, like exaggerated features and simplified forms, which are intended to add a whimsical element. These features do not break visual credibility as they are common in stylized representations and are executed without introducing distracting artifacts. The proportions maintain a cohesive and intentional design suited to such a style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A thick white outline frames the entire sticker design in Image B. The application of this outline is consistent around the entire design, providing a clear boundary that highlights and separates the design elements from the background. It does not interfere with clarity and instead enhances the visual coherence typical of sticker designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the use of a solid flat color for the circular base, with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it, achieve a dynamic effect without causing visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular base in Image B uses a solid flat color, which provides a contrast to the simplified vehicles that slightly extend beyond its boundary. This approach creates a dynamic effect by breaking the confines of the circle, enhancing the visual appeal without leading to inconsistencies or a loss of necessary details. The flat color serves as an effective background, keeping the focus on the vehicles while maintaining clarity.",
