    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle design utilizes a brick texture which must be inspected for consistency with the angular design present in traditional vehicle panels. Each piece must align properly and maintain the original geometric intent. Visually, the bricks are aligned in a way that mirrors the angular and sharp lines expected of motorcycle designs like those in Image A, suggesting uniformity and consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual inspection of Image B, the rims feature cog-like patterns with evenly spaced teeth around them. The rims appear circular, and the spacing and shape of the teeth align with the wheel diameter, showing no indications of being stretched or broken. This geometric harmony is crucial for proper wheel aesthetics and the rims fulfill this requirement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decals are evaluated to see if they integrate well into the brickwork. Although Image B uses bricks, the decals are represented by the design collaboration between physical and graphic elements. Yet, the absence of obvious gaps or layering issues suggests a seamless and natural integration even if the physical decals are not visible as in the original motorcycle in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycleâ€™s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspecting Image B, the motorcycle is positioned on a gray baseplate. The plate appears flat and continuous with no visible signs of elevation mismatch or warping. The wheels rest evenly on the baseplate, indicating proper support and alignment, which suggests the absence of any distortion or elevation irregularity.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case around the motorcycle needs to be reviewed for clarity and the absence of distortion. The boundaries are clearly defined, with no indications of ghosting or refraction errors. Additionally, the lighting within the case appears evenly distributed, with no unintended shadows affecting visibility. This points to a well-crafted display environment.",
