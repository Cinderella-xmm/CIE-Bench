      "question": "Does the origami bird on the left retain a natural appearance with no visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The origami bird on the left in Image B is crafted to resemble a bird made from folded paper. The texture and appearance align with typical traits of origami, which often feature sharp edges and polygonal facets due to the nature of folded paper. Its design does not show any inconsistencies or unnatural artifacts, reflecting a deliberate artistic choice to mimic origami art. Given this understanding, the appearance is consistent with the intended style.",

      "question": "Is the luminous crystalline structure of the bird on the right visually credible without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird on the right in Image B has a luminous, crystalline appearance, suggesting a digital or fantastical design. This type of structure would commonly consist of geometric patterns such as triangles and polygons forming a coherent mesh. Upon observation, the bird's structure forms a consistent pattern without visible distortions or breaks in this geometric arrangement, maintaining visual credibility within the artistic context.",

      "question": "Are the colossal, intricately carved ivory chess rooks structurally consistent with the birds perched on them, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are perched on chess rooks that resemble large ivory structures. These rooks maintain consistent proportions and stylistic coherence with the birds perched upon them, avoiding visual distortion. The scale and symmetry of the rooks align with the birds, suggesting careful attention to structural consistency between these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the surreal library setting with drifting books maintain visual plausibility without introducing any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting of Image B is a library with walls filled with bookshelves. There are no visible drifting books as mentioned in the question, which may be a misunderstanding. However, the library's depicted environment itself looks consistent and coherent. The background with well-organized stacks of books contributes to a plausible scene. There are no noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies interrupting the visual harmony of the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image as a whole maintain structural coherence and visual credibility, with all elements appearing naturally integrated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as an edited image, includes elements like origami and crystalline birds on large chess rook pedestals within a library setting. Each component, from the stylized birds to the substantial chess pieces and the library background, is integrated from an artistic and thematic standpoint. All elements are cohesively aligned with a fantastical style, ensuring visual consistency without any incongruent or jarring transitions among elements.",
