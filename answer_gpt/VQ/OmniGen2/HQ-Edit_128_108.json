      "question": "Does the transformed lantern maintain its original symmetrical shape and geometric proportions without visible distortion or broken lattice patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern maintains its symmetrical shape with detailed geometric patterns that are consistent with those seen in traditional Middle Eastern or Moroccan designs. The lattice patterns appear continuous and unbroken, indicating that the transformation did not introduce any distortion. The intricate design is preserved, showing no visible break or inconsistency, which aligns with common expectations of the craftsmanship in such lanterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the metallic embossed flame logo on the lantern's surface consistent with the surrounding material, showing realistic depth and reflections without unnatural edges or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the lantern does not feature a metallic embossed flame logo on its surface. Therefore, we cannot assess the consistency or realism of a non-existent element in terms of material integration, edge naturalness, or color harmony with the lantern’s design. The lack of this logo on the lantern allows us to decisively conclude that the question's premise is not applicable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the marketplace elements converted into side textures of the packaging clearly recognizable as derived from the original scene but stylized appropriately, without distortion or loss of fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging seen does not clearly display marketplace elements from the original scene in a stylized fashion. The design is dominated by a bold, embossed flame logo and uniform color. Without visible marketplace textures or specific stylized elements derived from the original scene found on the packaging, it is not possible to discuss the presence or quality of such design details, leading to no recognition or distortion analysis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the deep gold and amber tones applied to the packaging blend naturally with the existing lighting and material colors, avoiding harsh transitions or unnatural glow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold and amber tones of the packaging harmonize well with the overall ambient lighting, imparting a warm, luxurious appearance. The design integrates these colors seamlessly with gentle transitions, reflecting off the box’s surface naturally. Such blending reflects realistic material behavior under warm light, showing coherent color consistency without abrupt shifts or unnatural brightness, confirming the packaging's visual integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scented candle silhouette positioned correctly on the packaging front, maintaining proper scale and alignment with the surrounding design elements without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the packaging front displays a clear flame logo rather than a silhouette of a candle. The flame logo is centered, proportionate to the box, and seamlessly aligned with the rest of the design, showing thoughtful spatial arrangement. As there are no visual artifacts or inappropriate scaling issues observed, the presentation remains cohesive and aesthetically aligned.",
