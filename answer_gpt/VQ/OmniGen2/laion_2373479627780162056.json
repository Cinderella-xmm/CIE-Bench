      "question": "Does the suit jacket exhibit watercolor-style blue-black tones with smooth transitions and no visible digital artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit jacket shows a watercolor-style blending of blue-black tones. The transition between these tones is smooth, indicating that the colors flow into each other naturally without any noticeable disruptions. The absence of digital artifacts suggests a well-executed blending technique that mimics watercolor effects seen in artistic depictions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden pinstripes aligned with the suit’s fabric grain and do they reflect light consistently with the surrounding material, avoiding floating or misaligned lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible golden pinstripes on the suit. Therefore, the question about their alignment or reflection of light within the fabric does not apply to this image. The absence of pinstripes suggests a design choice that avoids potential misalignment or inconsistency issues.",

      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie uniformly distributed, maintaining consistent size and spacing across its surface without stretching or repeating errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie displays a pattern that appears uniformly distributed. The size and spacing of the pattern elements are consistent across the tie, contributing to a cohesive and error-free design. The absence of visible stretching or repeating indicates attention to detail in the tie's portrayal.",

      "question": "Does the leather-bound border feature realistic texture details such as stitching, grain, and embossed lettering without warping or clipping the subject’s features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather-bound border shows detailed textures that mimic genuine leather elements like stitching and grain. The embossed lettering is clearly visible and adds to the realism. The border is well-integrated with the image's layout, maintaining its realistic depiction without warping or intersecting with the subject.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background and surface of the image exhibit a soft and uniform satin-like paper texture. This texture allows for gentle reflections that enhance the overall appearance without causing glaring highlights or pixelation. The consistent texture adds to the seamless quality of the image.",
