      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style gorilla figure exhibits exaggerated proportions typical of chibi characters, such as a larger head and smaller body, which are consistent with the design style.

      "question": "Does the realistic illustration of the gorilla beside the box exhibit detailed textures and lighting that enhance the lifelike appearance, without any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't feature a realistic illustration of a gorilla beside the box; instead, it focuses on a chibi-style gorilla figure and its packaging. Given the chibi design, the focus is on a stylized portrayal rather than realistic textures or lighting. Thus, this question does not directly apply to the given image context.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box design includes the title 'JUNGLE KING' prominently at the top, which is clear and consistent with the theme. The typography is bold and well-integrated into the design, with no signs of abrupt alterations or artifacts. This maintains visual credibility and enhances the overall presentation, aligning with common packaging design standards.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style gorilla figure is adorned with accessories like a leafy crown and a wooden staff.
