      "question": "Does the dog's body maintain a natural and structurally consistent pose in the chibi-style, without any noticeable distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style dog has a simplified, cartoonish design, typical of chibi-style art. The proportions are intentionally exaggerated with a larger head and smaller body, characteristic of this artistic style. Therefore, while it may appear structurally different from a realistic dog, this is consistent with the chibi representation, which embraces such alterations as part of the stylistic choice. Hence, the body maintains a natural pose in terms of chibi-style standards.",

      "question": "Has the enlarged head been integrated naturally into the image, without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The head of the dog in Image B is purposefully enlarged as part of the chibi-style art. This enlargement is smooth and consistent with the rest of the image, showing no visible artifacts or unnatural textures. The transition between head size and body size appears seamless within the context of chibi art, which is designed to have exaggerated proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball touching the dog's nose in a way that looks natural and physically plausible, without any awkward positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the dog with a tennis ball held in its mouth instead of touching its nose, typical of a chibi-style toy or decoration. The positioning seems intentional for this style, and the ballâ€™s placement is consistent with how such toy designs convey a playful interaction. Hence, no awkward positioning is observed from a chibi-style perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relief tennis ball pattern on the base match well with the rest of the scene, contributing to a cohesive and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates a tennis ball with the text 'BILABBO' as the base for the chibi-style dog. The pattern and design are consistent with the playful and whimsical theme of the chibi art. This pattern adds to the overall aesthetic and does not appear out of place, contributing to a cohesive visual in terms of the chosen artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the edited image retained the original focus on the ball while successfully integrating the chibi-style elements, resulting in a balanced and visually coherent composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses prominently on the chibi-style dog and the tennis ball, similar to Image A's emphasis on objects akin to tennis balls. The integration of the chibi-style elements does not detract from this focus but rather enhances it through a playful character holding a ball. The scene maintains a coherent composition with a clear emphasis on these elements central to both images.",
