      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's pose is depicted in an Egyptian formal style, which often uses a stylized form with clear, coherent lines similar to ancient Egyptian art.

      "question": "Have the palm leaves been stylized as sacred flora within a hieroglyph-bordered scene on a sandstone textured wall without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm leaves become part of a hieroglyphic scene, depicted in a stylized manner on a sandstone texture. While the detailing is less intricate than a realistic approach due to the artistic conversion, it preserves a coherent form and does not introduce unnatural textures. The transition serves as a thematic element rather than losing the essence of the palm leaves within the stylized depiction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B strives to echo the visual style of Ancient Egyptian reliefs. The choice of color, layout, and elements are consistent with authentic Egyptian motifs.
