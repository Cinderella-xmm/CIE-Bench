      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine of the elephant retain the natural grass-eating pose without introducing unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figurine of the elephant features a standing pose with its trunk raised. This does not particularly represent a grass-eating pose, which typically involves the elephant bending its trunk towards the ground to pick grass. The pose appears more stylized than natural. In Image A, the elephant is indeed in a natural grass-eating pose, bending down towards the grass. Thus, Image B introduces an unnatural style compared to the natural pose in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the elephant's skin in the figurine realistic, showing natural details without appearing overly smooth or artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an elephant figurine with simplified and smooth textures typical of chibi-style and toy design. There is a lack of detailed skin texture. In contrast, Image A shows the natural texture and wrinkles of an elephant's skin, emphasizing intricacies which are not present in the edited version. Thus, Image B’s textures appear artificial compared to the realism in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the base design mimic a muddy terrain naturally and complement the elephant figurine without creating visible gaps or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base design consists of an acrylic dome over a green turf-like texture resembling grass rather than muddy terrain. This aligns with a stylized depiction rather than a natural setting. Image A, however, shows a realistic scenario with an elephant on a grassy area mixed with earth. Image B does not mimic muddy terrain naturally.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transparent acrylic dome over the figurine clear and does it not cause distracting reflections or distortions on the figurine or the surrounding base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a smooth, clear acrylic dome over the elephant figurine and base. It doesn’t show significant reflections or distortions that obstruct or significantly affect the view of the elephant or base. The design maintains visual clarity and coherence. Therefore, it fulfils the criteria of being clear without distractions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no noticeable artifacts, such as missing components or misplaced shadows, that disrupt the visual plausibility of the figurine scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cohesive scene with the elephant figurine placed under a clear dome on a decorative base labeled 'Jungle Friend.' The lighting and shadows are consistent with no apparent artifacts or missing components, maintaining visual plausibility. Compared to Image A, which doesn't have any extra components like shadows or artifacts, Image B is visually consistent.",
