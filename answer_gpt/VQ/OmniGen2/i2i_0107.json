      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi version of the character simplifies the design, using exaggerated features for a cute effect. In the chibi figure, the hair is represented in a stylized and simplistic manner, which is consistent with chibi aesthetics. However, the original image includes more detailed and realistic textures. Both images lack glasses, suggesting the focus is on hair for facial recognition. The original's hair texture is more nuanced, whereas the chibi version focuses on a minimalistic design. The reduction in realism to achieve the chibi style means it does not fully preserve the original's detailed textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi figure, the scarf and wand are designed with simple, cartoonish textures typical of chibi art. The scarf is rendered to be smooth and flat without intricate detailing, and the wand is similarly stylized. This matches the overall art style, which employs solid colors and simple lines, consistent with the other elements of the figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi art, proportions are deliberately exaggerated to achieve a cute and endearing style. The hand holding the wand is small and matches the scale of the oversized head and simplified body. This is typical of chibi proportions, where anatomical accuracy is secondary to stylistic representation. Therefore, within the chibi context, the hand is proportionate to the rest of the figure.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure placed in the hand shows consistent lighting and shadows that match the wooden background, indicating a coherent integration. There are no obvious artifacts or mismatched edges that disrupt the harmony between the figure and the background, resulting in a seamless blend.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf and tie in the chibi figure feature smooth, flowing lines consistent with simple geometric shapes typical of chibi art. There is no evidence of broken or distorted geometries; instead, the elements maintain a clear and coherent form that contributes to the overall cohesive chibi style.",
