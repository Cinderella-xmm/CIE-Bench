      "question": "Is the entire cityscape and car enclosed within a transparent, geometrically perfect cube with consistent refractive qualities that distort surrounding elements naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the car and a portion of the cityscape are visible within a clear enclosure that resembles a cube. The clear material allows for visibility of contents while maintaining its shape, indicative of something like glass or acrylic, which distorts light in a subtle and natural way. The second image compares the scene being inside a geometrical object without visible inconsistent refraction or distortion effects, confirming the explanation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car's surface exhibit a uniform, high-quality metallic texture with natural reflections and no artifacts like blotches, smudges, or missing specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carâ€™s metallic surface appears smooth and reflects light in a realistic, homogeneous manner. There are no visible imperfections like smudges or artifacts. The surface of the car in Image B has a polished and manufactured look typical of high-end vehicles, and despite being under this clear enclosure, it retains a consistent quality of reflection.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers scaled down uniformly and proportionally without geometric distortions such as stretched windows, skewed angles, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers appear as miniaturized elements within the display. They maintain proportional integrity with consistent angles and dimensions, mirroring realistic architectural form. There are no visible distortions in scaling, such as exaggerated or stretched shapes, leading to the conclusion that the miniaturization maintains the original architecture's geometric consistency.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the windows of the skyscrapers display small, consistent, and physically plausible light points resembling micro LEDs without haloing, bleeding, or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows of the depicted skyscrapers show small light points that are consistent and similar to what one might expect from micro LEDs, which are evenly distributed and without evident halo effects or light bleed. The brightness levels are plausible and reflect a typical night-time urban environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, dense green foliage with natural color variation and no pixelation or blocky rendering, indicating proper micro-scale modeling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees within the transparent cube exhibit dense, green foliage with natural color variations, showing attention to detail and high-quality rendering. There is no evidence of pixelation or blocky textures, which suggests an accurate micro-scale modeling approach was utilized to depict them.",
