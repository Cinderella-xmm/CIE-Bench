      "question": "Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet appears to be enlarged, as seen in its relative size to the other proportions of the figure. Despite this enlargement, the helmet maintains coherent shape and realistic placement on the head, showing no signs of deformation or unnatural edges. An enlarged but well-proportioned helmet should not exhibit jagged or improperly scaled edges, which is consistent with what Image B presents. Additionally, the placement aligns with common protective gear usage, adding realism.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are covered in gloves, which prevents an exact count of the fingers. However, the glove design allows for an assumed standard alignment of five fingers each with no visible distortions, stretches, or additional irregularities. A properly rendered glove should generally mimic the human hand's proportions and articulation, which is evident in this image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowsuit's red tones appear vivid and consistent with the expected texture of winter fabric. The uniformity of the color distribution and the subtle shading suggest a matte finish typical of fabric rather than glossiness associated with synthetic or glossy materials. No pixelation or disconnection from the underlying material is evident, indicating that the red tones are well-rendered.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style portrays snow and tree outlines as clean and well-defined shapes that resemble paper cut art. This style typically involves clear separations between layers, which is consistent throughout the image. There are no visible gaps, overlaps, or floating fragments, indicating a cohesive and intentional design choice that maintains the integrity of the layered shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the snowboarder's body posture aligned with the direction of the snowboard, showing balanced weight distribution and no floating limbs or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder's posture is aligned with the snowboard, achieving a balanced depiction as common in snowboarding stances. The figure's arms and legs demonstrate appropriate positioning with no floating or implausible angles, suggesting fluid movement and even weight distribution. The imagery adheres to a realistic portrayal of snowboarding stances where balance is crucial.",
