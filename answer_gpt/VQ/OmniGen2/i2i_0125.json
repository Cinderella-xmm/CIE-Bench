      "question": "Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area around the apples does not exhibit any unnatural textures or artifacts. The addition of text appears to be a graphical overlay and doesn't interfere with the background surrounding the apples. The design maintains a consistent visual environment with the fruit positioned centrally and the text placed as enhancement rather than disruption.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fonts for \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are in simple and clear typography that matches the aesthetic of the image. They are in brown color that complements the apples and background tones. The text integration appears smooth and deliberate, avoiding any direct clash with the visual elements of the apples and background, which maintains consistency.",

      "question": "Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shapes of the apples remain unchanged and undistorted. The text additions do not overlap or obstruct the perception of the apples' natural roundness. The positioning of the text is strategic, allowing the apples to maintain their original contour and visual prominence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the alignment of the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows thoughtful placement of text that respects the visual balance of the image. 'Sweet' is positioned at the top right and 'Fresh' at the bottom left in a manner that feels natural and does not encroach upon the apples' space or disturb the overall composition. The alignment is deliberate, enhancing the image without affecting its balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the apples, including their speckles and light reflections, remained clear and undamaged after adding the text “Fresh” and “Sweet”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detailed characteristics of the apples, such as speckles and light reflections, remain intact and clearly visible in Image B. The text overlay does not touch the apples directly and therefore does not affect the integrity of these minute details. The preservation of these features implies a careful design process, retaining the original quality of the image.",
