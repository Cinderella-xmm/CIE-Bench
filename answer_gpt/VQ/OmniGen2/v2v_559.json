      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi version showcases a miniaturized, stylized character design. The suit appears smooth and consistent with a chibi art style, missing intricate textures found in realistic images. However, it remains true to the simplified chibi aesthetic. The cup appears well-rounded and consistent with real cups, ensuring no apparent distortions. Chibi art often simplifies details while maintaining recognizable shapes; thus, Image B maintains structural integrity suitable for its style.",

      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the background retain the natural appearance of the suit and the warm glow of the lamp without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style involves a smooth and simplistic rendering of the suit. While the texture is less detailed compared to a realistic depiction, it matches the chibi art style without visible artifacts or errors. The lamp retains its warm glow, akin to Image A, giving the scene a cozy ambiance. Combined with the chibi character's suit, the visual style remains coherent, without any unnatural artifacts disrupting the aesthetic consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and suit details of both chibi characters rendered with sufficient detail and texture to avoid looking unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style typically involves simplified, exaggerated proportions, with less focus on detailed textures. The faces are featureless, attributed to the deliberate blurring, making evaluation limited in expression detail. The suits, however, are rendered in a uniform manner, in line with chibi art conventions. Given the stylistic choice, they appear natural within a chibi context, despite less intricate detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands of the chibi characters, especially the one holding the cup, appear proportionate and physically plausible without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are rendered in the simplified, chibi style. The hand holding the cup is appropriately sized for the chibi figure, and the representation of fingers is coherent with typical chibi proportions. The physical posture and grasp of the cup show no visual distortion, aligning with common portrayals in chibi art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene enhance the visual credibility and realism of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame around the chibi-style image in Image B provides context, offering a conceptual boundary that turns the scene into a framed picture. This addition doesn't necessarily enhance realism but transforms the presentation into a more creative and stylistic element, which is suitable for the chibi art style. It complements the scene without affecting the perceived credibility or the inherent artistic style.",
