    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse in Image B appears to be visually observed as a single seamless object under the glass dome without any apparent puzzle sections or interlocking edges. It gives the impression of being smooth and continuous without segmentations. Additionally, no clear puzzle edges can be discerned from the visual cues, suggesting the rendering does not simulate it as a puzzle. Therefore, the puzzle sections aren't defined at all in Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is presented as an intact figure with painted patterns, not as distinct puzzle pieces. There aren't any interlocking edges to evaluate for alignment of floral patterns between puzzle pieces, and the patterns appear continuous across the body. Because Image B does not show puzzle sections, the question of alignment of patterns between sections doesn't arise.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears transparent and lacks visual distortions, smudges, or reflections that would indicate poor quality or unrealistic simulation of glass. The surface appears uniformly smooth and clean, with typical slight reflective properties seen in real glass, indicating effective rendering of material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base supporting the glass dome shows discernible wood grain and texture, reflecting realistic wood properties. The rendering appears intricate with visible lines and texture akin to polished wooden surfaces. Additionally, the compass is seen as a central feature on the base, positioned logically and consistently with the design, scale, and surface plane, indicating coherence and appropriate embedding.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the accents visible on the base around the compass replicate the appearance of brass well with a muted matte finish and slight reflections, indicative of aged metal. These elements are placed logically, contributing to the aesthetic and functional design of the base, holding coherence with real-world design, and demonstrating consistency in the material's appearance.",
