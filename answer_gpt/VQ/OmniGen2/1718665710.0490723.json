      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the chibi figure is larger than typical human proportions, which is a common feature of chibi-style designs. The hair retains its curls and volumeness, without any visible distortion. This indicates that the head is enlarged proportionately as per the design language of chibi figures, maintaining its intended proportions and style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black outlines uniformly thick and cleanly separated from internal details such as hair, skin, and armor engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character exhibits distinct black outlines that are evenly thick throughout the figure. These outlines clearly separate the key character features such as hair, armor, and other details, which aligns with typical animation or chibi art styles where outlines are used for emphasis and definition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor has a smooth and polished appearance with highlights that suggest a reflective metallic surface. The color transitions appear smooth, with no visible pixelation or repeating texture patterns, indicating a clean rendering consistent with digital art standards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pauldrons and chest plate as symmetrical and well-defined. The edges appear sharp and the design elements of the armor are clear, without any visible distortion or asymmetry that might suggest a flaw or oversight in rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chain appears to be well-integrated with the chibi figure, attaching securely at the top of the head. The links of the chain are uniformly shaped and appear physically connected, indicating that the design was implemented with attention to coherence and realism within the context of a keychain.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background exhibit a uniform dark texture with no bright reflections or unnatural gradients, consistent with velvet material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is consistently dark and appears to be textured in a way that resembles velvet material. There are no bright reflections or harsh gradients that would disrupt the visual interpretation of a smooth, dark textile backdrop.",
