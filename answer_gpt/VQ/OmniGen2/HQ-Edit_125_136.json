    {

      "question": "Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the astronaut's helmet and suit segments appear smooth and rounded, maintaining geometric consistency with realistic astronaut gear. The shapes are clearly defined without jagged or broken edges, indicating a polished edit process. Common knowledge suggests that space suits have distinct parts like the helmet visor, suit panels, and life support pack, which are well-represented here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture on the spacesuit is smooth and consistent, resembling realistic fabric without visible or unnatural pattern repetition. This uniform distribution aligns with the appearance of an actual spacesuit, which consists of tightly woven materials to provide durability and protection. The edit maintains this plausible texture distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The accent gold colors in Image B are strategically placed on design elements like patch borders. They are well-contained and do not bleed into other parts of the image, maintaining a clean and precise look. Such finite color applications are typical in spacesuit designs for visibility and identification purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronautâ€™s limbs or the station structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the directional arrows suggest movement from the astronaut to the ISS without intersecting or distorting limbs or structures. The visual elements indicate navigation paths or instructions that are crucial for maintaining clarity in space diagrams and infographics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is aligned to the bottom edge and does not interfere with key visual components like the Moon or ISS. The visibility and readability of the text are clear without the presence of distortion or shadows. This text placement ensures that supplemental content does not obscure visual priority areas.",
