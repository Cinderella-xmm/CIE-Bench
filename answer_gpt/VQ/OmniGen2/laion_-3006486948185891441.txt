    "Question": "Q1: Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horse’s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the showcase box visually appears to surround the horse sculpture uniformly, aligning seamlessly with the horse’s outline. The transparency of the box enables direct visibility of the horse without introducing double images or distorted edges. The clean lines and angles suggest a well-crafted box with no visible light refractions that could alter the perception of the horse within.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
    "explanation": "The gold accents in Image B are consistently colored and exhibit reflection typical of polished metallic surfaces. This indicates that the gold features are rendered without any unnatural highlights, streaks, or bleeding into adjacent colors, maintaining a polished and cohesive appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the brand logo clearly legible, properly centered on the black base stand, and free from pixelation or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The brand logo on the black base stand in Image B appears sharp and well-defined, with no pixelation or blurring. Its placement is centered, reinforcing precise alignment and providing clear legibility, which implies professional design and execution in the presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
    "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the backdrop pattern inside the box aligns with the perspective of the showcase without warping or errors in tiling. The continuity and intactness towards the edges affirm its seamless application, avoiding any distortions or cutoffs that would disrupt the visual flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the magnetic closure mechanism isn’t explicitly visible, the seamless design of the box implies a well-integrated structure. There are no apparent gaps, overlaps, or parts that look out of place or mechanically improbable within the visual representation, suggesting the presence of realistic components within the constraints of the box.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all visible parts of the horse sculpture (including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas) clearly preserved and unobscured by the added packaging elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the horse sculpture inside the transparent box where all elements such as the head, legs, and saddle are visible without obstruction from the packaging. The clarity of each visible part suggests a thoughtful design in which the packaging does not detract from viewing the sculpture’s detailed features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
