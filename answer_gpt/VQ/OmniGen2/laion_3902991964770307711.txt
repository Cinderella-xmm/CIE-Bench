    "Question": "Q1: Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a perfume bottle with a transparent, tapered glass cap, exhibiting realistic light behavior and smooth contours typical of glass. The cap is clear and allows light to pass through, creating reflections and highlights that are characteristic of glass materials. This description fits the cue given in the question about 'transparent, tapered glass caps,' which aligns with the appearance of Image B.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle features smooth, gold-finished elements like the collar and spray mechanism, which have a consistent reflective surface and lack any visible seams or breaks. This matches the description in the question about 'smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently,' as these elements on the bottle provide a seamless and polished look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show an embossed brand logo on a base but rather has a label on the bottle itself. The label is flat and does not resemble embossing, so it does not meet the criteria of an embossed logo blending naturally with the texture without anomalies. Therefore, the question does not apply accurately to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral-engraved patterns are present on the perfume bottle and appear evenly distributed. They follow the bottle's contours and seem integrated into the design without looking like surface overlays. This matches the question's description of evenly distributed floral-engraved patterns on the candelabra.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the script font label is placed on the flat surface of the front of the perfume bottle and does not follow a curved tube. It is naturally positioned without warping, stretching, or overlapping. This description does not match the question about following the curvature of a tube, meaning the question does not accurately describe any aspect of Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
