      "question": "Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is visibly clear and transparent. The surface appears smooth without any visual cues of distortion such as warping, cracks, or unusual refraction patterns. These observations align with the standard characteristics of a well-crafted glass dome, where transparency and clarity are essential features. Common sense dictates a smooth glass dome would ensure visibility of the encased object without any visual hindrances.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic pavement tiles beneath the lantern are clearly defined and uniformly sized. The edges of the tiles appear sharp, with precise alignment and accurate color transitions, suggesting a high level of detail. There are no visible signs of blurring or misalignment. This aligns with the knowledge of finely crafted ceramic pavements that have consistent patterns and colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textile merchants and fabric canopies are presented as miniature elements alongside the lantern. They are proportionally smaller, which is apparent when observing their relative size to the lantern. The shapes and textures of the canopies and market stalls are realistic and distinct, without signs of stretching, duplication, or unnatural fusion with other elements. This follows design logic where scale models maintain proportional consistency and textural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees have fronds that are shaped in a realistic manner and their bases appear rooted in the ground. The shadows are consistent and appear to align with the light emanating from the lantern, lending depth and dimensionality to the scene. The trees do not appear flat or detached from the ground, and this aligns with the expectation of well-integrated miniatures in a diorama setup, where objects are rendered with realistic shadows and grounding.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the dome shows a surface that appears to have a subtle texture with variations in tone and depth, reflecting a realistic, weathered look. There are no visible uniform patterns or digital artifacts that often signal over-processing. It maintains a natural appearance, which is consistent with the knowledge of how tactile surfaces like stone or ceramic bases are expected to appear when aged or weathered, without digital interference.",
