    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the body shapes of both elephants smoothly transformed into curved bottle forms without visible breaks or unnatural bends in their silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body shapes of the elephants are seamlessly integrated into the bottle structure. The elephant figure transitions smoothly into the bottle without any abrupt changes or unnatural bends, maintaining a cohesive and continuous silhouette as one might expect in a well-designed fusion of figurine and bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant ears appear as gold-trimmed bottle caps with smooth edges and no misalignment or deformation compared to the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant ears designed as gold-trimmed caps. These caps are well-aligned with the bottle, maintaining smooth edges without any visible misalignment or deformation. The integration is aesthetically pleasing and suggests a well-thought-out design mirroring high-quality craftsmanship in the physical world.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants replaced with a clear, evenly distributed glass mosaic pattern that reflects light naturally without artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back of the elephant features a clear pattern that resembles a glass mosaic. The light reflects naturally on this pattern, and there are no visual artifacts indicating disruption or uneven distribution. This consistent and natural reflection suggests attention to detail in the texture simulation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brand logo and fragrance name label clearly visible along the trunks without stretching, warping, or overlapping with other features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand logo and fragrance name in Image B are prominently displayed on the trunk of the bottle. They are clearly visible, with no signs of stretching, warping, or overlapping. This clean and crisp presentation displays a consideration for readability and design clarity.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the gold trim, glass mosaic patterns, and bottle surfaces exhibit consistent lighting and reflection behavior that aligns with real-world material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates the gold trim, glass mosaic patterns, and bottle surfaces interacting with light in a manner that is consistent with expectations for real-world materials. The lighting and reflection are coherent across these elements, suggesting an understanding and application of how such materials naturally respond to light and improving realism.",
