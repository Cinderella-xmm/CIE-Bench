      "question": "Does the metallic, multifaceted eye cluster derived from the NXP module appear structurally consistent with the original module's shape and size, without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic eye of the beetle seems to be derived from the NXP module in Image A. It is integrated smoothly into the beetle's design, maintaining a consistent shape and size. The metallic texture of the eye blended naturally with the rest of the components of the beetle without any visible distortions or unnatural features.",

      "question": "Are the bioluminescent spots created from the solder points on the green circuit board visually plausible and detailed, without breaking the original geometric shapes or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beetle's surface includes bioluminescent spots which stem from the green circuit board's solder points seen in Image A. These spots appear to be well-integrated into the beetle's design and maintain their geometric shape, matching the visual plausible appearances of bioluminescence found typically in beetles without any artifacts or distortions.",

      "question": "Do the glowing wing veins evolved from the circuit board's traces maintain a natural appearance and retain fine details, without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing veins on the beetle's wings in Image B are clearly influenced by the circuit board traces in Image A. These veins retain fine detail and appear to fit a natural patterning similar to real insect wing veins. There are no obvious signs of texture overlay issues or artifacts disrupting this appearance, providing a credible integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the cyborg beetle, formed by blending the NXP module and the green circuit board, visually credible and structurally consistent, without introducing distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cyborg beetle composed with features from both the NXP module and the green circuit board seen in Image A. This composition appears visually credible and structurally consistent, as elements from both sources fit naturally into the beetle form without signs of visual distortion or artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the neutral background remain unchanged and free of artifacts after the transformation of the NXP module and the green circuit board into the cyborg beetle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B have a neutral background which serves as a clean backdrop for the objects presented. Comparing the backgrounds, Image B retains the same neutral tone and texture as Image A, showing no signs of artifacts or distortion despite the transformation in the foreground object.",
