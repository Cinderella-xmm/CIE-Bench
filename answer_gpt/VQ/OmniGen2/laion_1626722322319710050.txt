    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic statue have five fingers on each hand, with natural joint angles and smooth surface transitions, and no visible seams or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is depicted under a glass dome with the hand and fingers clearly visible. The fingers appear to have natural joint angles and there are smooth surface transitions. There are no visible seams or distorted geometry in the statue's hands, indicating a high level of craftsmanship and detailed modeling that align with world knowledge of quality statue creations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature trees are shown alongside the statue inside the dome. The leaves appear to have a degree of semi-transparency as light seems to pass through them, giving a realistic natural appearance. Their positioning does not overlap with the statue but maintains a balanced scale and spacing which does not distract from or obscure the statue. This positioning maintains aesthetic consistency and visual appeal in miniatures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the engraved plaques flush with the base surface, with readable text and consistent depth, and do they follow the contour of the pedestal without appearing detached or warped?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the plaques on the pedestal base appear to be flush with the surface and show consistent depth and clarity in the text. They are seamlessly integrated into the pedestal design, following its contour accurately without any signs of detachment, warping, or inconsistency. This reflects high attention to detail in rendering and design typical in quality miniature or decorative object production.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the glass dome fully transparent with smooth, continuous curvature, showing accurate reflections of nearby objects and sky, and free from jagged edges or internal distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is depicted as fully transparent with a smooth and continuous curvature. The reflections visible on the surface are consistent with realistic lighting, capturing nearby light and objects accurately. There are no jagged edges or internal distortions present, signifying a high-quality glass rendering typically seen in well-crafted display domes or models.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates a dome stand that seems to be made of polished stone, with distinct and subtle texture variations adding to its realism. The vine patterns on the stand are clearly defined and follow natural growth patterns, with no breaks or repetitive features that would suggest artificiality. This reflects skillful design work intended to make the object aesthetically pleasing and realistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the glass dome above the statue and base is precise, ensuring no part of the figure or pedestal is clipped through. The dome rests securely on the stand, with no signs of floating or tilting, indicating careful alignment consistent with stable and realistic object placement. This ensures the display appears coherent and visually satisfying.",
    "answer": "Yes"
