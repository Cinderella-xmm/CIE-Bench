      "question": "Is the figure proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe such that her body parts (especially limbs and head) maintain natural anatomical alignment and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure of the woman within the globe maintains proportionate anatomical features. Her limbs appear naturally aligned, with no evident stretching or compression, indicating careful scaling to keep the body's natural proportions within the constrained space of the globe.",

      "question": "Are the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle clearly visible and free from blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail after conversion to a 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress and braided hairstyle of the figure are depicted with clarity, showing intricate patterns similar to those in real life textiles and hairstyles. The details are well-represented in the 3D model, without signs of blurring or loss of fine detail, suggesting the 3D conversion was done with high fidelity to the original textures.",

      "question": "Do the wall patterns inside the globe accurately reflect the colors and shapes of the dress's pattern without warping, misalignment, or color deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior wall patterns of the globe reflect similar colors and shapes seen in the dress, suggesting an effort to match decorative styles. There is no visible warping or misalignment of these patterns, and the colors maintain consistency, indicating accurate design replication.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature roots seem to be naturally arranged, resembling authentic root structures that emerge from the soil. They do not intersect or distort the figure's legs or skirt, indicating thoughtful placement in the design process.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature animals are appropriately scaled relative to the figure and positioned at ground level. Their textures and forms look natural, with no visible artifacts, implying that they were crafted and positioned with attention to realism and proportion within the scene.",
