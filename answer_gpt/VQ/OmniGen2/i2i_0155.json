      "question": "Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Breathe' is added at the top left corner. To determine if it blends naturally, observe if the font style, size, and color contrast harmonize with the image's overall aesthetic. The word is positioned in an empty space and does not overlap with or obscure any part of the plant, ensuring its structural appearance is preserved. The clean background facilitates a seamless integration without visible artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the text 'Calm' appears at the bottom right corner against a plain background that does not interfere with the window frame. There is no evidence of distortion or alteration in the geometry of the window frame because the text is situated in such a way that it does not affect any structural components of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Text such as 'Breathe' and 'Calm' do not possess physical presence to alter the light and shadow dynamics within the image. Analyzing the leaves for natural shadows and highlights confirms they are consistent with a light source from the window side, unaffected by the text additions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the terracotta pot and saucer appears unchanged by the addition of text, with consistent color, grain, and shadowing. Textual elements added in Image B do not influence the texture of solid objects like the pot and saucer, as they only visually overlay without physical modifications.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Breathe' and 'Calm' are positioned in the background and space created by the window setting without altering the image's proportionality or symmetry. The plant's structure and window frame retain their original form. This ensures that there is no distortion or disruption in proportions.",
