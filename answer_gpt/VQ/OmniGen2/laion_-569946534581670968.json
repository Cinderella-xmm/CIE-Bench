      "question": "Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy versions of the chicken wings appear to have a simplified, rounded shape lacking the distinctive anatomical features of real chicken wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips. They are more akin to vaguely wing-shaped pillows without detailed contours. Thus, they do not retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowl’s edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bright orange pillow inside the white bowl appears to be flat and round, fitting snugly within the bowl's boundaries. There is no visible bulging or distortion of the bowl’s edges, suggesting the pillow is properly scaled and placed.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light-colored surface appears to be smooth and lacks distinct wood grain patterns. Since it does not show any digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts, the surface seems uniformly smooth, possibly mimicking a wooden texture but without clear grain patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush wings are depicted in a uniformly bright orange color without any indication of a raised or granular texture. They look soft and do not visually suggest a crunchy feel, as the surface is smooth without variation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, the orange pillow is placed inside the bowl in much the same location as the original sauce in Image A. It maintains proper alignment and depth within the white bowl, without any appearance of floating or overlapping improperly.",
