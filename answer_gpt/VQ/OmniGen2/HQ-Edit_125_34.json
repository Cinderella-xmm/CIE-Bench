      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass gears and levers on the desk properly aligned with the deskâ€™s structure, showing no signs of floating, misshapen geometry, or unnatural material seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass gears and levers appear to be integrated into the desk design. They are placed on either side of a central control console, emanating a sense of symmetry. The machinery is evidently meant to evoke a steampunk aesthetic. Upon inspection, there are no visible signs of floating, and the proportions appear consistent with the rest of the desk's design. The geometry seems intact with seamless integration into the setup. This suggests that the brass elements align well with the desk's structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the modified books display consistent glowing effects without distorting their page edges or causing unnatural light bleeding into surrounding surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books arranged around the central control unit do not display any glowing effects inconsistent with their form or function. Each book rests naturally, with no glowing emanating from within them. There is no distortion along their edges or any visually unnatural light bleeding into the surrounding areas that would suggest a modification of this kind.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the holographic globe above the monitor clearly visible with proper depth and transparency, and does it cast natural shadows or reflections on the desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object referred to as the holographic globe in Image B is actually a stylized globe integrated into the design. This globe appears to be a solid object rather than a holographic projection. As a result, it doesn't exhibit the typical characteristics of a hologram, such as transparency or depth. Moreover, the lighting and shadow behavior remain consistent with this being a physical object; there are no shadows or reflections on the desk surface that align with a hologram. The visual cue indicates it's meant to be seen as part of the time-travel study's decor.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the newly added ornate frames around the windows seamlessly integrated with the existing window structure, without overlapping glass panes or creating distorted perspective lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not actually depict a window scene similar to Image A; instead, it portrays an artistic, stylized design element as part of a time traveler's study. Given the design context, there are no visible windows to evaluate the frames' integration within this image. As such, this inquiry relates to a nonexistent feature in Image B. The visual focus is on the central chrono-themed device rather than any window elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements (gears, glowing books, hologram, window frames) share consistent lighting and shadow behavior, avoiding abrupt changes in brightness or material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be intentionally uniform and congruent with a steampunk or time-travel theme. Each element, from gears to decorative books and globe models, seems designed to complement the overall look, with consistent brass and gold tones emitting a warm glow. However, as there is no hologram or glowing books, these features cannot be directly assessed for consistency. The materials presented are visually coherent, and the lighting behaves naturally without noticeable abrupt shifts, supporting the aesthetic intent.",
