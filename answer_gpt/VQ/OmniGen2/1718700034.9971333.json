      "question": "Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are formed by crystal shards that appear to be symmetrically aligned. They have a structured and coherent look, with the facets evenly placed and without noticeable gaps or distortions. This symmetry is judged by the uniform repetition of the geometric shapes on both sides of the body, suggesting a harmonious and well-constructed design.",

      "question": "Do the golden leafy strands follow the natural flow of the original hair and appear integrated without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden leafy strands are placed as a crown or headband, seeming to naturally follow the flow of the hair. They are positioned so they integrate smoothly with the hairstyle, avoiding any appearances of floating or being disconnected. This appearance is derived from their close adherence to the contour of the hair and its style.",

      "question": "Does the shirt display a uniform, soft velvet texture with natural shadowing and no repeating patterns or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt has a consistent and soft texture that resembles velvet. The natural shadowing enhances the depth and appearance of the material, reinforcing the impression of a velvety fabric. There are no visible repeating patterns or digital artifacts that would suggest an artificial or flawed design.",

      "question": "Is the background a consistent deep gray wall with no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or remnants of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited background in Image B displays a uniform deep gray color, providing a neutral backdrop for other elements. There are no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or remnants from the original scene that disrupt its continuity. This seamless background helps in focusing the attention on the subject in the foreground.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements—crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt—properly aligned with the body and each other, without clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt are all aligned properly with the body, showing no signs of clipping or overlapping errors. Each element fits well within the context of the image—neither distorting the figure nor showing positional inaccuracies—indicating a meticulously integrated design where all parts are harmoniously placed.",
