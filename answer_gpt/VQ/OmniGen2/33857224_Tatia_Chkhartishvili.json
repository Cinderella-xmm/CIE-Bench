    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the girl's head appears to be intentionally designed to be large, a common characteristic seen in chibi-style or cartoon character designs. This design choice is often used to emphasize and create an exaggerated form for visual interest. The proportions seem consistent with typical chibi design where the head is larger relative to the body, yet it does not result in any unnatural stretching or compression that would disrupt the harmony between the neck and shoulders.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair are uniformly presented with a matte finish and a soft rubber-like texture. This visual treatment is consistent with how rubber or plastic figures typically appear, avoiding any glossy shine or textured inconsistencies that would distract from the intended aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains structural details of the red boots, such as buckles, which are clearly discernible. While the lace dress retains recognizable features like its overall shape, some of the intricate knit patterns seen in the original may not be as detailed due to the simplified style typical of cartoon-like representations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture in the edited image aligns well within the typical exaggerated cartoon or chibi style. The spine, hips, and knees are placed to simulate a bending action, retaining smooth curves without any disjointed or floating segments, allowing for a continuous and visually cohesive character design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver keyring is seamlessly attached to the chibi character, with no visible gaps or overlapping edges. Furthermore, the wooden plank background is rendered with consistent texture and spacing, which enhances the overall appearance and maintains a tidy, organized visual arrangement.",
