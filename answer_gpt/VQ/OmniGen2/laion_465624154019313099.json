      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes added to the cake positioned naturally on the surface without distorting the shape or texture of the meringue domes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are positioned on the flat yellow layer of the cake, not on meringue domes. This positioning is natural as eyes are placed on the smooth, flat surface, avoiding distortion or interference with the cake's texture, which would typically happen if they were placed on uneven surfaces like domes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The strawberries on top of the cake in Image B maintain their normal size and shape. They are used as decorative elements, resembling a 'hat' on top of the cake, but their appearance remains consistent without any noticeable distortion or alteration in size compared to typical strawberries. This maintains the realistic look of the strawberries even when used out of their conventional context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faint silhouettes of utensils in the background visually consistent with the lighting and depth of the scene, without introducing harsh edges or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features spoon-like silhouettes that are faint and blended well with the overall dark background. They do not have harsh edges, appear consistent with the ambient lighting, and maintain a sense of depth without clashing with the main subject, ensuring they blend naturally into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the strawberries and garnishes arranged around the cake in a way that maintains structural balance and does not overlap or distort the cake’s base or side layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, strawberries and garnishes are placed on top and around the sides of the cake, creating a visually appealing balance. They are arranged in a way that complements the cake's round structure, without overlapping or distorting the base or the top and side layers of the cake, maintaining both its aesthetic and balance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cake's expression with slightly raised eyebrows and added dialogue does not affect the cake's physical structure. The layers remain rigid and intact, without any visual cues suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the cake's layers, preserving the solidity typical of a layered cake.",
