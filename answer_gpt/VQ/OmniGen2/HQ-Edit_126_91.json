      "question": "Does the transformed lid appear as a smooth, symmetrical compact mirror case with consistent glossy black finish and no visible geometric distortions or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lid of the piano is shown as smooth with a glossy black finish. The symmetry and consistency in surface appearance indicate that there are no visible geometric distortions or jagged edges, which is characteristic of a high-quality finish akin to a compact mirror case. This conclusion is drawn by observing the reflections and contours on the lid, confirming the glossy and symmetrical attributes.",

      "question": "Is the keyboard area replaced with a palette of eyeshadows that shows distinct color pans with natural shading and reflection, without blending artifacts or misaligned geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the keyboard area replaced with a palette of eyeshadows. The distinct color pans are visible with each pan displaying natural shading and reflection, typical of a well-designed makeup palette. There are no visual artifacts such as unnatural blending or misaligned geometry, supporting the impression of a high-quality, cohesive design.",

      "question": "Are all surfaces of the piano uniformly coated in a glossy black material that reflects light consistently and shows no areas of uneven texture or matte regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the piano in Image B are uniformly coated in glossy black material, as evidenced by the consistent reflection of light across different parts. There is an absence of uneven texture or matte areas, indicating a uniform application of the glossy finish. This is reinforced by the way shadows and highlights behave on the surface, suggesting high material quality.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo and slogan on Image B are clearly positioned on the piano’s body. The typography appears sharp and non-blurry, indicating a high-resolution application of text, and it is properly aligned with the surrounding surfaces, ensuring it appears as an integral part of the piano's design. The clarity and alignment suggest attention to detail and precision.",

      "question": "Do the piano and its surroundings exhibit consistent lighting, shadow direction, and material interaction, with no floating objects or perspective distortion in the hallway setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano and its surroundings exhibit consistent lighting and shadow direction, indicating that the scene is cohesively lit without inconsistencies. Material interaction appears natural, as reflections and shadows on the glossy surfaces align with the lighting. There are no floating objects or perspective distortions seen in the hallway, suggesting a well-composed and realistic setting with proper integration of the piano into the environment.",
