      "question": "Does the battlefield scene in the background appear naturally integrated without unnatural textures or color clashes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The battlefield scene is analyzed based on the visual cues such as color harmony and blending of elements. The scene includes explosions and numerous soldiers, all within a consistent color palette, contributing to a seamless appearance. The textures of explosion clouds match realistic depictions without jarring contrasts against the soldiers or the setting, suggesting good integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the character's pose and facial expression consistent with the original image and not distorted by the new background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The consistency of the character's pose is evaluated by comparing typical pose features like limb placement and orientation within the larger scene. The edited image shows the character holding a stance that aligns well with the surrounding soldiers, maintaining the natural body proportions and angles without signs of distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the battlefield scene in the background avoid broken geometric shapes and retain fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The battlefield scene is closely inspected for geometric uniformity and detail precision. It displays smooth edges along soldiers and weapons, and the explosion clouds are rounded and well-defined, indicating well-preserved geometry without signs of pixelation or breaks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there no visible artifacts or blending issues where the new battlefield scene meets the edges of the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The merging of elements is analyzed around the character’s edges where the scene and character transition visually. The image maintains clear and clean lines where the character interacts with the background, indicating an effective blending process without visible artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the explosion in the battlefield scene coherently match the character’s expression and contribute to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explosion’s integration with the character’s presence is assessed in terms of contextual fit and overall composition. Despite the lack of visible facial expression, the character's pose aligns with the tension and urgency suggested by the explosive background, contributing to a coherent and natural scene.",
