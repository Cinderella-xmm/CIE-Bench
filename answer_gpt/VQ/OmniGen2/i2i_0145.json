      "question": "Does the white horse maintain its natural texture and lighting, integrating seamlessly into the new forest background without showing any unnatural contrasts or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse retains a smooth and consistent texture with a light source that seems to harmonize with the new forest setting. There is an overall coherence in lighting; the horse appears well-integrated within the forest environment, with no visible unnatural contrasts or disruptive shadows that would detract from the image's overall harmony. This suggests a good match between the horse and the forest lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added forest and tree elements visually consistent with the horse's presence, and does the sunlight streaming through the trees create natural highlights and shadows on the horse without unnatural disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest elements in Image B, such as trees and sunlight beams, appear to be carefully blended with the horse's presence. The sunlight creates a natural pattern of highlights on the horse's body that align with the light's direction, indicating thoughtful integration. There are no abrupt changes or unnatural highlights or shadows that disturb the visual coherence between the horse and the forest scenery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hooves of the horse appear to interact naturally with the forest floor, such as showing realistic mud or leaves, and are there any visible artifacts where the grass meets the new forest ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interaction of the horse's hooves with the forest floor includes a shadow cast on the ground, which is smooth with no visible artifacts at the transition points between grass and forest floor. The consistency suggests that care was taken in the integration to simulate a realistic interaction, without showing leaves or mud specifically, but maintaining a clean transition instead.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the horse's body correctly simulate sunlight filtering through the trees and casting shadows from surrounding forest elements, without any unnatural bright spots or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the horse in Image B effectively simulates sunlight filtering through the trees, casting natural-looking shadows and highlights across its body. The light distribution seems seamless and consistent with the direction and strength of the sunlight, avoiding any unnatural bright spots or dark patches that would suggest poor integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the horseâ€™s leap look structurally coherent with the new forest setting, with appropriate motion blur and a trajectory that suggests a natural leap from within the shadows without any geometric distortions or visual incongruities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's leap appears dynamic and consistent with the forest setting. There are no overt geometric distortions or mismatches in momentum that break the illusion of a natural leap. The motion blur is appropriately subtle, maintaining clarity while suggesting movement, reinforcing the perception of a natural action occurring within the shadowed forest environment.",
