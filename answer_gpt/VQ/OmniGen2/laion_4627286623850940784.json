      "question": "Is the seed packet in the gnome’s left hand proportionally sized and properly aligned with the hand, showing no signs of floating or unnatural attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seed packet appears proportionally sized to fit within the gnome’s hand. The alignment is carefully executed, with the basket nestled naturally against the fingers, avoiding any visual signs of floating or detachment from the hand. Observing the details in both images suggests the original design intended such placement, with no discrepancies in positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the faux soil and botanical illustrations at the base of the gnome seamlessly integrated, showing natural texture and proper alignment with the ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faux soil at the base accompanies spherical objects, aligning naturally against the container and resting seamlessly on the ground. The texture mimics real soil very closely, giving it a realistic touch without artifacts. Botanical illustrations on packaging leverage surroundings without disrupting the flow, ensuring visual integration within a garden context imagined for the product.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the seed bombs in both hands have a natural spherical shape with appropriate surface texture and fit securely within the gnome’s hands without distorting finger positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seed bombs maintain a spherical shape and have a surface texture appropriate for natural objects such as seed balls. The positioning fits securely within the gnome’s hands, with fingers neatly placed to accommodate them without distortion or unnatural extensions. The realism of the objects supports the perception that the gnome holds them genuinely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the earthy textures applied to the seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and illustrations consistent in style and free from visible artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, earthy textures consistently apply across the seed packet, seed bombs, faux soil, and botanical illustrations. The consistency in style is evident as they possess uniformly designed shading and textures, eliminating pixelation or unnatural forms. Together, they present a cohesive visual that maintains consistency throughout the packaging seen in product design standards.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition reflects balanced structuring akin to a product package. Elements including the gnome figure, seed bombs, faux soil, and botanical illustrations are arranged to avoid clutter. Each component finds its place logically, fostering accessibility and appeal indicative of proper marketable product design. Such arrangement ensures focus without losing thematic presentation akin to real-world packages.",
