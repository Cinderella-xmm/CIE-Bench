    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figure within the dome features smooth surfaces consistent with a polished ornamental design, particularly with gleaming gold and brass elements. Unlike in a real-life rusted or battle-worn armor in Image A, these features are often less visible in a miniature model intended for decorative purposes. Therefore, due to the scaled-down size and smooth finish, fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches will not be clearly visible or purposefully included.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears seamlessly enclosing the armor figure without any noticeable distortion, seam lines, or refraction effects that might warp the visual representation of the interior objects like the armor. Typically, a finely crafted miniature showcase emphasizes clarity and a distortion-free enclosure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cogwheels in Image B appear strategically placed at the base, each with consistent size ratios and interlocking teeth design visible. No cogwheel appears to be disconnected or floating, following common design aesthetics for decorative mechanisms which maintain structured alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are visibly well-integrated into the shoulder armor piece, maintaining harmony with the rest of the metallic texture and design motifs. There are no apparent misalignments or unnatural bends distorting the visual coherence and mechanical integrity expected in such a miniature armor model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no evident copper pipes following paths along the joints of armor, hence nothing to judge on continuity or intersection with armor components. Such intricate piping often isn't a feature seen in ornamental or simplified miniature designs as presented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass orbs are suspended in positions that avoid intersecting with the armor, maintaining clear spatial separation. They exhibit a uniform metallic finish consistent with the rest of the golden elements, including uniform lighting effects that enhance their ornamental placement.",
