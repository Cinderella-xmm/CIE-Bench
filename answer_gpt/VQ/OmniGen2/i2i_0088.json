      "question": "Does the gold spoon maintain the same structural coherence as the original fork with no unnatural texture or distortion in the handle and bowl area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold spoon has a smooth, continuous surface along both its handle and bowl. The details and edges are consistent and do not exhibit any visible artifacts or distortions. The reflection and shading are coherent, indicating a natural metallic surface. Comparing this with Image A, the fork also maintains a similar level of detail and coherence, with no irregularities in texture or structure found in either utensil.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the gold spoon and the napkin appear natural without disrupting the napkin’s texture or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spoon lies on the napkin without causing unnatural shadow disruptions or texture breaks on the napkin. The napkin's folds and lighting remain consistent with a natural setting where an object rests on the fabric, suggesting that the interaction between the spoon and napkin is seamless. This is comparable to Image A, where the fork similarly interacts with the napkin without causing texture or shadow disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the gold spoon integrate naturally with the scene and appear as part of the spoon rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate patterns on the handle of the gold spoon in Image B are well-integrated, looking embossed and natural as part of the gold material instead of appearing as an added layer or decal. This suggests a high-quality and realistic design. The pattern’s integration is consistent with the utensil’s metallic sheen and the overall lighting of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the gold spoon exhibit realistic reflectivity and shine consistent with a metallic spoon under the lighting conditions of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon in Image B reflects light in a way typical of a highly polished metallic surface, showing bright highlights and soft transitions. The gold color contributes to its realistic metallic appearance, suggesting that it is convincingly part of the scene's lighting environment. This kind of reflective property is expected from metallic objects and is reflected in the image's ambient light conditions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the size and positioning of the gold spoon proportionate and physically logical in relation to the napkin, avoiding any unusual scaling issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon in Image B is positioned centrally on the napkin and is sized appropriately, corresponding logically to real-world spoon dimensions when placed on a napkin of such size. There appears to be no distortion or disproportionate scaling, ensuring the spoon's size and placement looks physically plausible. This mirrors the proportionate appearance seen in Image A with the fork.",
