    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the neon accents added to the motorcycle’s body emitting a consistent, smooth glow without harsh edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the motorcycle does not appear to have visible neon accents added to its body, nor do any parts of it emit an ethereal glow. In Image A, the motorcycle is in its original form without accents, and in Image B, detailed inspection confirms no glow or neon-like features are added around the motorcycle’s main body, barrels, or frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hover wheels maintain symmetrical, closed geometric forms without visible deformation or broken spokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B reveals standard motorcycle wheels unchanged, displaying conventional round shapes with visible spokes, providing a realistic representation. There is no indication of hover wheels or futuristic design as postulated in the question, therefore the geometry reflects what is expected from traditional wheels.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital interface seamlessly embedded in the front panel without intersecting or obscuring existing elements like the headlight or mirrors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not exhibit a digital interface incorporated into the motorcycle's design. Elements such as the headlight and mirrors remain unaltered from their original state as seen in Image A. Thus, no integration or overlay involving a digital interface occurs upon scrutiny.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the isometric box exhibit uniform edge lengths and correct angles, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspection of Image B shows two boxes placed near the motorcycle. Both boxes display uniform edge lengths and correct angles without any observable skew or misalignment. The geometry appears well-structured and adheres to isometric rendering standards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates a boxed figure next to the motorcycle which possesses a transparent window. This window allows unobstructed visibility of the figurine within the box without any warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting effects affecting its clarity. The design maintains integrity without distortion.",
