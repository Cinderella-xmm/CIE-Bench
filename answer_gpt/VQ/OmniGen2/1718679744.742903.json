      "question": "Does the bold black outline fully trace the crocodile's form without breaking or misaligning at joints, scales, or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is outlined in a bold black line, typical of pop art or graphic design styles. This outline traces the entire form of the crocodile and is consistent without visible breaks or misalignments, ensuring the various parts of the crocodile, like joints and facial features, are clearly defined within the artistic style. This stylistic choice is seamless, contributing to a coherent and complete depiction of the crocodile.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the hat and sunglasses vividly saturated but still preserving visible texture details like knit stitches and lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and sunglasses are rendered in high saturation colors, typical of pop-art illustrations. However, due to the nature of this style, there is no focus on preserving detailed textures such as knit stitches or reflections, as the depiction is intentionally flat and graphic. The focus is on color blocks rather than textures, which are typical in realistic depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin repeat consistently across the neck, back, and limbs without gaps, overlaps, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crocodile in Image B features highly stylized geometric patterns, which are consistently applied across the body, including the neck, back, and limbs. These patterns are part of the cohesive visual design, showing an intentional repetitive design that maintains consistency without visible gaps, overlaps, or distortions, which is integral to pop-art illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns aligned correctly with the crocodile’s head and body, showing no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the hat and sunglasses are illustrated in a manner that suggests proper alignment with the crocodile's head, as indicated by their positioning consistent with the animal's facial features. Similarly, geometric patterns align effectively with the crocodile's form, indicating a deliberate and cohesive design without any components appearing floating or misaligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's facial features are highly stylized but maintain a coherent proportion that aligns with a recognizable crocodile, keeping the snout, teeth, and eyes deftly placed. While they are artistic in nature, they reflect an accurate representation within the context of the pop-art style which often exaggerates and simplifies without losing essential proportional balance.",
