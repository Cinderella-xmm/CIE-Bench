    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the chibi character straight and properly connected at joints, with no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are depicted with stylized limbs typical of this art style. The limbs appear smooth and connected properly at the joints, with no visible kinks or unusual proportions, consistent with world knowledge of chibi illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the face of the chibi character have symmetrical eyes and a clearly defined mouth, with no distorted lines or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters' faces are primarily obscured. However, the style of chibi art typically includes large, symmetrical eyes and a simple, clear mouth. Given no distortion is visible within the art style and taking into account typical design, symmetry and clarity can be inferred.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono clearly visible with sharp edges and no color smudging or pixelation, even after color enhancement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figures wear kimonos with floral patterns. Chibi designs use bold and clear lines, suggesting the patterns are sharp and well-defined without smudging or pixelation, which aligns with the expectation of clarity in animated art styles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the cherry blossom branch composed of five fingers with natural curvature and no extra digits or deformed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the branch is designed in a simplistic chibi style. Typical chibi characters may not depict all five fingers or might stylize hands into simple shapes; thus, expecting all five fingers may not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the falling petals in the dancing pose follow a downward arc consistent with gravity, and are they evenly distributed without clustering or floating above the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, petals appear around the characters in a manner consistent with falling due to gravity. They seem evenly distributed in the background, adhering to the stylistic choices of balance and composition in chibi art.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of each chibi figure features pastel colors. These backgrounds appear uniform in color, with no visible artifacts, stripes, or shifts, which is typical for digital prints or magnetic sheets showcasing character designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all four chibi figures fully visible and evenly spaced on the magnetic sheet, with no overlapping or cut-off edges?",
