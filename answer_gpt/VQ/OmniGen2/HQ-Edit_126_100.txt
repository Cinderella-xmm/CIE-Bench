    "Question": "Q1: Do the transformed columns resemble organic wooden legs with natural joint angles and proportional thickness, without visible distortion or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the columns appear as wooden structures that mimic the appearance of organic legs. They exhibit natural joint angles and maintain a proportional thickness throughout, resembling tree trunks or roots. These features contribute to a cohesive and believable structure, with no visible distortions or broken geometry that would suggest artificial manipulation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the roof area show a gradual transition from straw-like material to leafy branches with realistic leaf shapes, spacing, and lighting interaction, without jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The roof in Image B displays a thatched straw appearance with a smooth transition to leafy branches. The leaves have realistic shapes and appropriate spacing, interacting well with the light to create natural shadows. There are no jagged edges or unnatural textures that would disrupt the visual harmony of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the satellite dish replaced by a large, detailed eye with a visible iris and pupil, positioned naturally on the side of the structure, without floating elements or mismatched shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no large, detailed eye visible in place of a satellite dish. The structure does not showcase any such unusual element, and all visual components are consistent with the natural design of a treehouse, without any elements that are out of place like a floating eye. Thus, the satellite dish is not replaced by an eye.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wall surfaces covered with detailed bark patterns showing natural cracks, ridges, and color gradients, without repeating textures or uniformity indicating artificial generation?",
    "explanation": "The walls of the structure in Image B are adorned with detailed bark patterns, exhibiting natural cracks and ridges with an organic texture. These features are distributed randomly, and the color gradients appear natural, with no signs of repeating textures or uniformity that would imply artificial generation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the orange blossoms emit a faint, diffused glow that blends with ambient lighting, without sharp halos or unnatural brightness that separates them from the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "The orange blossoms in Image B are integrated into the environment with ambient lighting. They do not emit a distinct glow or have sharp halos; instead, they are naturally illuminated, blending seamlessly with the surrounding foliage without standing out due to unnatural brightness.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the vines emerge from multiple points on the structure, hang downward with natural curvature and density variation, and interact realistically with light and shadows?",
    "explanation": "The vines in Image B emanate from various points on the structure, with a natural flow and varying density. Their curvature is believable, and their interaction with light and shadows is consistent with what one would expect in a natural setting, enhancing the rustic aesthetic of the treehouse.",
    "answer": "Yes"
