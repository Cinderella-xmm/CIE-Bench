    "Question": "Q1: Does the African savanna at night blend seamlessly with the existing train and tracks, without any unnatural edges or contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the African savanna at night is a separate background from the train with tracks. A seamless blend would mean there are no visible edges or contrasts between the two areas. Upon analysis, the savanna and the railroad do not naturally coexist, as the lighting, environment, and perspective are distinct, leading to an incongruent blend.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stars and the Milky Way depicted naturally, without any artificial or pixelated textures disrupting their appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stars and Milky Way are a prominent feature of the night sky. Natural depiction would mean clear, smooth lines and a realistic distribution of stars. The Milky Way appears smooth and natural without evidence of artificial or pixelated textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks correspond logically to the new nighttime savanna setting, maintaining structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train was taken in daylight, showing distinct lighting and shadows that would not logically match a nighttime savanna setting. The light sources and direction do not match a night environment, indicating a lack of coherent lighting adaptation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the size of the train relative to the vastness of the African savanna and the starry sky proportionally correct and believable?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the size of the train is specific and large for what would be expected against a vast savanna and a starry sky, disregarding perspective depth. The mismatch in scale suggests it would look unnatural in such a setting.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the train been preserved without degradation or introduction of unnatural textures during the editing process?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, assessing the train reveals no significant loss of details or introduction of unnatural textures. The train's detail remains crisp as observed in the original image without visible degradation due to editing, which shows careful preservation during the process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
