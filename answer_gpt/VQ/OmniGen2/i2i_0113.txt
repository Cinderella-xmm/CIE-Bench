    "Question": "Q1: Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The character's face in Image B has been intentionally blurred, so a direct analysis of its integration into the vinyl material is not possible.

Given that other elements like hair and costume visually align with the vinyl aesthetic while retaining realistic details, it can be inferred that the face might also be similarly integrated if visible.",
