    "Question": "Q1: Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arm-like appendage is formed by balconies extending outward in a robotic style. These appendages have consistent proportions in terms of scale and stylization, resembling a robotic arm. The joints appear to be smoothly connected, and there are no visible jagged edges, indicating careful attention to maintaining a natural appearance within the context of its stylized design. The balconies have been treated to resemble parts of a mechanical arm, and the transition between sections is smooth. In a comparison to Image A, which features regular balconies, the transformation into appendages in Image B has been executed without any disproportionate elements or unnatural bends.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, glowing panels appear at window positions, emitting a soft, consistent glow that integrates smoothly with the building's surface. The distribution across the facade is uniform, ensuring that each panel complements the structural design without producing uneven lighting effects, halos, or pixelation. Observing Image A shows regular windows, while Image B introduces uniform glowing panels in these spaces, suggesting a careful design that avoids harsh lighting discrepancies or visual noise.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays gold circuit patterns elegantly running along the building’s edges and structural lines, ensuring the patterns have plausible placement corresponding to the architectural design. The thickness of each line is consistent, maintaining a uniform gold color that complements the building’s aesthetics. No random overlays or digital artifacts are visible, suggesting that the design of the circuits is intentional and well-integrated. Image A, by contrast, has no such embellishments, making the transformation in Image B stand out as carefully planned and executed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, dynamic mechanical components are visible at the edges of the building, resembling robotic parts. These components are strategically linked to the main structure through observable mechanical connections, following realistic pivot points that prevent any appearance of floating or misalignment. This careful integration ensures the components look plausible within their setting, as opposed to Image A, which does not feature any mechanical parts. The placement and design in Image B avoids visually disjointed or floating elements, suggesting thoughtful integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the building’s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
    "explanation": "Image B features exposed gears at various structural junctions of the building, which are scaled and positioned with careful consideration of the building's height and width. These elements do not appear oversized or misaligned, matching well with the adjacent features and maintaining architectural consistency. The gears are likely intended to enhance the mechanical aesthetic without disrupting scale or symmetry. Compared to Image A, which lacks these mechanical elements, Image B effectively integrates these gears, ensuring appropriate scaling and placement relative to the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
