      "question": "Do the mechanical sentinels replacing the buses have intact geometric shapes, smooth surfaces, and consistent glowing blue underlights without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buses have been stylized with glowing blue underlights, but they still retain their original shape and appearance. The geometric shapes are consistent, as the buses are recognizable and maintain their form. There are no visible rendering artifacts like jagged edges or pixelation present on the vehicles indicating high-quality editing in this area.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the golden automaton version of Big Ben have uniform metallic texture, proper vertical alignment, and a centrally placed cosmic eye clockface without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image depicts Big Ben with enhanced lighting effects, but there is no transformation into a 'golden automaton' or 'cosmic eye.' The structure retains its historical appearance with realistic lighting and alignment. Since the structural elements and textures are consistent with reality, the scenario described does not apply to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the energetic vines wrapped around the Houses of Parliament following plausible growth patterns, maintaining consistent glow, and not intersecting through solid architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of elements such as energetic vines is not observed. The Houses of Parliament remain unchanged aside from lighting effects but do not feature any such fantastical elements. Thus, the description does not hold true for the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the airships in the sky properly scaled, positioned at a reasonable altitude, and displaying iridescent surfaces without harsh edges or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces two airships floating in the sky. The airships appear to be properly scaled relative to the overall scene, and they are positioned at a reasonable altitude that suggests they are not obtrusive. The surfaces of the airships have a colored, glowing tone with smooth transitions and lack harsh edges, which contributes to a believable depiction without discrepancies in shadowing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) blend with the ambient lighting of the scene without creating overly bright spots or unnatural contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alterations result in various glowing effects, such as underlights on buses and glowing airships. These elements integrate harmoniously with the existing light, particularly the ambient orange hue of the setting sun, and do not create excessive brightness or jarring contrasts. The overall scene maintains a balanced aesthetic.",
