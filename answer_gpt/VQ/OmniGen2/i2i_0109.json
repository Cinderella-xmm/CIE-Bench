      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's proportions appear well-balanced and anatomically plausible for a figure based on a superhero character. The muscles and armor are consistent with the typical depiction of such a character across various media. The geometric shapes of the armor and limbs align with standard proportions, reflecting a realistic representation. Image A shows a dynamic real-world depiction, while Image B—a figurine—appropriately simplifies and scales down these proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effect around the base of the figurine, as well as the glow from the hammer, is smoothly integrated into the setting. The light does not produce any distracting or unrealistic shadows, and the illumination enhances the overall aesthetic without clashing with the environment. Image A features dramatic lighting which adds to the dynamic feel, and Image B effectively uses these effects to provide a consistent ambiance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine’s hands gripping the hammer exhibit appropriate anatomy with realistic texture for a synthetic material. The fingers appear correctly numbered and are positioned naturally, indicating a secure grip. The ergonomic design aligns with a typical superhero stance. Image A provides a more lifelike representation, while Image B maintains this realism within the context of a figurine.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the plastic figurine retained a structurally sound head and face consistent with the character's identity, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the face, the figurine’s head maintains accurate structural characteristics such as hair style and positioning that are typical of the character's depiction. The hair texture is simplified but retains a level of detail that is consistent with plastic figurines. Despite the blurred area, the rest of the head structure appears robust. Image A shows a detailed portrayal but Image B effectively captures the essence with simplified detail suitable for a model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the armor and cape of the plastic figurine appear cohesive with the rest of the figurine, avoiding any unnatural textures or materials that disrupt the visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor and cape are visually consistent with the motif and materials typical of plastic action figures. The textures appear natural for the figurine's synthetic medium, and there is no apparent disruption in visual continuity between components. Image A’s realistic depiction is translated into Image B with appropriate simplification, ensuring the figure retains a cohesive and believable form.",
