    "Question": "Q1: Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot figures appear to be designed with a coherence that maintains a connection to the cylindrical form of the batteries. The heads and limbs are proportionally scaled to fit well with the battery structure, showing an intentional transition from the original shape to the robot figures. They have humanoid features but are designed to visually incorporate elements of their cylindrical origin.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape background is placed correctly behind the robot figures, with an atmospheric gradient that shifts from darker to lighter tones at the horizon. The light source appears to emanate from behind the buildings, creating a glow that complements the lighting on the robot figures, suggesting consistent light source alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the digital screen displaying “10 Years in Storage” seamlessly integrated into the scene with readable text, smooth edges, and ambient lighting that matches the sci-fi theme without pixelation or distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not actually display a digital screen with the text '10 Years in Storage'; there is a focus on a different thematic representation. Therefore, there is no such integrated element to assess in terms of readability or ambient lighting within the context of the sci-fi theme.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the title 'Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!' displayed in a clean, bold, futuristic font with uniform stroke width and no visual artifacts like jagged edges or overlapping glyphs?",
    "explanation": "The text 'DURACEELL POWER PRESERVE ADVENTURES!' in Image B is designed with a bold font that is likely intended to appear futuristic. The stroke width seems uniform with clean edges, and there are no overlapping glyphs or visual artifacts like jagged edges, suggesting a seamless textual integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the robot figures, title, and digital screen arranged in a way that avoids overlapping text or important visual elements, ensuring all components are legible and distinct?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot figures and titles are arranged without overlapping text or critical visual elements. Each component is distinct, allowing clear visibility and separation of elements, ensuring legibility and clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
