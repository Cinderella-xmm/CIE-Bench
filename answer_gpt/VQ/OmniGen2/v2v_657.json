      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain the structural coherence of the original image, avoiding any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure box has clean and sharp edges, and the artwork on the box is symmetrical and proportionate. The text on the box is legible and fits within the designated areas, reflecting proper alignment and design. Common knowledge about product packaging further suggests that a professionally designed product box will be structurally coherent, avoiding any distortions. Based on these observations, the structure of the box appears well-designed and consistent with real-world expectations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figurine inside the box, visible through the transparent portion, maintains consistent proportions seen in typical chibi figures, characterized by a larger head and smaller body proportions.

The details, such as the helmet and skateboard, are clearly visible and proportionate to the rest of the figure, matching the style's intent.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine outside the box displays smooth textures and consistent lighting, parallel to the stylized nature of Funko Pop figures, which are designed with simple surfaces and vibrant colors. The shadows and highlights on the figure align with its environmental lighting, avoiding any glaring inconsistencies. Such attention to detail is crucial for maintaining a seamless integration into the scene, and the use of soft shadows and highlights complements the overall visual harmony of the image.",
