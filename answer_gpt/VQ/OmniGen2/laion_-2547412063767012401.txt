    "Question": "Q1: Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is depicted in a stylized, medieval-inspired suit of armor. The armor is designed to encapsulate human musculature while maintaining its structured and rigid appearance. Despite these constraints, the armor should contour to the body's natural lines without introducing any broken or illogical geometry. Observing the armor, the elements seem to align well with the human form, such as how the shoulder and arm pieces curve naturally along the expected lines of a person's body—not causing visual distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the ocean-themed armor on the rightmost figure’s jacket smooth and continuous without visible tiling or unnatural blending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the artist's interpretation of armor covering the figure on the right integrates oceanic themes likely through texture and color. For such a design to appear smooth and natural, the texture should not repeat in a manner that creates jarring lines or breaks, known as 'tiling.' However, analyzing the armor's surface, textures appear thoughtfully crafted to bed smoothly, with a consistent flow over the jacket. No evident tiling or abrupt texture transitions are visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the right hand of the rightmost figure have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and joint curvature, even with armor applied?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, examining the rightmost figure reveals that the armor is applied uniformly over their hand. The design would need to preserve accurate anatomy despite any stylistic choices. This means five fingers should be apparent, with expected spacing between digits and the armor preserving joint curvature. The drawing shows five well-proportioned and correctly spaced fingers, each curved naturally, suggesting an adherence to realistic depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the sky gradient from the horizon upward smooth and free of color banding or abrupt transitions between orange, blue, and purple hues?",
    "explanation": "A smooth gradient in artwork indicates subtle transitions between colors without clear dividing lines or 'banding.' In Image B, observing the sky, the transition from a bright orange to softer purple near the top demonstrates a seamless move through intermediary blues. These colors blend subtly across the scene, ensuring a visually pleasing and coherent atmosphere, free from visible bands.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the typography at the bottom of the image clearly legible, properly aligned, and textured with ocean-spray effects without repeating patterns or sharp edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text at the bottom serves an important role in conveying thematic elements. The letters should remain easily readable, aligned appropriately with one another, and should exhibit the addition of texture (simulating ocean spray) without causing disruption through repetition or overt sharpness. The typography appears to meet these criteria, with a clear outline and stylish texture that mimics ocean spray while preserving clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the ocean creature motifs on the armor of the leftmost figure small, integrated, and positioned in a way that does not distort the armor’s form?",
    "explanation": "The integration of oceanic forms (like motifs of sea creatures) should consider an armor’s pre-existing curvature and its surface rigidity. For the leftmost figure in Image B, these motifs must fit naturally within the armor, not protruding unnaturally or causing noticeable distortion. The artwork displays these motifs subtly but effectively, implying they are small and integrated into the armor’s design seamlessly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the shadows of the figures fall forward onto the rocks in alignment with the sun’s position behind them, and are the silhouettes sharp and unbroken?",
    "explanation": "Shadows are cast in the opposite direction of a light source. Given the sun's position directly in the background, one would anticipate shadows projected forwards. Image B shows figures' shadows extending along the ground in a manner consistent with this expectation, and they are depicted as sharp and continuous, maintaining unbroken silhouettes across the rocky terrain.",
    "answer": "Yes"
