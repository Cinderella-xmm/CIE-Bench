    "Question": "Q1: Does the monocle added to the tortilla chip maintain a consistent size and shape relative to the chip, and is it seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or unnatural shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a monocle added to the tortilla chip within the scene. The image focuses on a mound of guacamole with cartoonish features unrelated to a tortilla chip-modifying element such as a monocle; therefore, the question seeks a non-existent detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound proportionally sized and shaped like a realistic hand, with no more than five fingers and natural joint lines, and does it appear to emerge naturally from the guacamole without breaking its texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole mound has white circular appendages that mimic cartoon-style hands, often seen in animated characters. They are not realistically shaped or proportioned, and there aren't detailed fingers or joints as seen in realistic hand anatomy.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the spice rack positioned behind the tortilla chip in a way that respects perspective and shadow direction, and does it blend naturally with the existing background without visible seams or color mismatches?",
    "explanation": "Image B contains a stylized kitchen scene where no spice rack is directly interacting with the tortilla chip. The background elements are consistent with artistic design, void of noticeable inconsistencies related to incorrect perspective or shadow issues.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the mini flag banners aligned horizontally and evenly spaced above the table, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the light source, without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are flag banners hanging above in the background. They are aligned horizontally and appear evenly spaced. The colorful flags do not show pronounced shadows or depth, suggesting a typical flat design rather than a realistic exhibition influenced by light source.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole been adjusted to pastel shades without losing their inherent textures or becoming unnaturally pale or washed out, maintaining visual credibility as edible items?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guacamole is depicted with a bright, playful green tone common in cartoonish imagery. This color does not lose its texture but fits the stylized nature far from realistic pastel adjustment intent. The tortilla chips are not apparent due to the focus on the animated design.",
    "answer": "No"
