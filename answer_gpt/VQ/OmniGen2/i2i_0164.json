      "question": "Does the area on the train where people were previously sitting look natural without any obvious artifacts or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where people were previously sitting on top of the train has been edited to remove them, leaving the surface of the train visible. The absence of artifacts or gaps suggests that the editing process was done smoothly, and the train roof now appears as it would naturally look without any occupants. The continuity of the train's texture and structure implies that the editing was coherent and professionally done.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the conductor added atop the train well-integrated with the existing lighting and shadows, giving a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the conductor is added atop the train. The proper integration of lighting, especially considering the direction of sunlight in the image, is crucial for natural appearance. The conductor's position and the way shadows fall on him are consistent with the ambient light conditions, indicating a well-executed editing process that ensures the conductor fits naturally into the context of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the flag held by the conductor look natural, with proper proportions and a logical position relative to the train's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flag held by the conductor in Image B should appear proportional in size relative to the conductor and positioned logically considering the train's movement. The flag appears properly attached, with a realistic waving motion that aligns with the direction of the train's forward motion, contributing to a coherent and natural appearance in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any distortions or misalignments in the train's structure near the area where people were removed, and the conductor was added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the train's structure, especially in the area previously occupied by people and now featuring the conductor, appears consistent with the rest of the train. No distortions or misalignments are noticeable, indicating a seamless editing process that preserves the trainâ€™s structural integrity and visual continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image remain balanced and stable after editing, with no noticeable shifts caused by the removal and addition of people?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B remains stable and balanced post-editing. The removal of people and addition of a conductor does not lead to any visual imbalance; the train retains its central position, the distribution of elements remains coherent, and the visual narrative continues to be consistent with the original scene, ensuring the image appears natural and cohesive.",
