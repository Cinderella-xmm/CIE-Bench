      "question": "Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock frame, crafted from what appears to be a frosted crystal material, retains recognizable details similar to those in traditional carved wooden designs, including a floral crest and ornate side columns. The crispness of the carvings can be assessed by observing that the floral design and column details appear intact and intricate, suggesting no warping or flattening has occurred despite being in a different material. While crystal materials may sometimes appear less detailed, the preserved clarity indicates attention to maintaining the original carved aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Roman numerals on the clock face in Image B are etched onto a crystal surface. They are visually inspected for even spacing and alignment by verifying each numeral's positioning corresponding to traditional hour positions. The legibility considers the contrast between the numbers and the background. Proper observation reveals the numerals are distinct, clearly marked, and well-aligned, maintaining the regularity expected in well-crafted timepieces.",

      "question": "Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pendulum consists of a faceted crystal, which can be assessed for symmetry by observing its geometry. A symmetric shape would be expected to have balanced facets and equal dimensions on either side of its centerline. The pendulum appears properly connected to the chains which suspend it, showing no signs of detachment or misalignment from the main body of the clock, thus indicating a standard construction for such clocks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface behind the clock in Image B is a white marble wall. A uniform texture is checked by ensuring consistency across the surface, without irregularities or evident pattern interruptions. Soft and natural shadows are evaluated by looking at the light gradient and shadow fringes beneath the clock, which would appear smooth without abrupt changes if natural lighting is assumed. The absence of visible seams or artificial transitions corroborates the authenticity of the marble reproduction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, seamless integration of crystal components is judged by inspecting the joining points between the frame, face, and pendulum for any visible discontinuities, texture changes, or gaps. Crystal should reflect light in a coherent manner, with natural, even highlights and no harsh, unexpected reflections. Observing the continuity and efficiency of construction in the junctions suggests well-executed design, where no inconsistencies are detected across material transitions.",
