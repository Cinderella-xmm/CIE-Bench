      "question": "Does the airplane maintain its structural consistency despite being transformed into a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is depicted as a stylized cartoon character with exaggerated features typical of chibi design, such as large eyes and a smiley face, which significantly alters its structural appearance compared to a typical airplane. Common sense suggests that airplane designs are generally streamlined and functional, while this transformation focuses on characterization and aesthetic appeal, deviating from structural consistency.",

      "question": "Are the festive red hues and golden motifs integrated seamlessly into the airplane's design without appearing unnatural or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of bold red and gold, along with dragon motifs and Chinese characters, is consistent with cultural themes and aesthetics. These design elements are carefully applied to enhance the festive and celebratory nature of the airplane in Image B. The integration considers visual harmony and cultural references, ensuring they appear purposeful and fitting within the image's context.",

      "question": "Do the tassels hanging from the wings and the \"囍\" symbol on the tail appear natural and well-integrated into the image without causing any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tassels and '囍' symbol are decorations that align with traditional Chinese celebratory themes. They are placed with attention to detail for aesthetic integration within the festive scene. Tassels naturally evoke associations with lanterns and decorations in Chinese culture, and their placement alongside the symbol does not detract from the image's coherence or cause distortion.",

      "question": "Does the golden sunset background with floating Chinese lanterns enhance the festive atmosphere without disrupting the visual coherence of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warm golden sunset complements the overall festive aesthetic, providing a serene and harmonious backdrop that matches the celebratory mood conveyed by the airplane and lanterns. The addition of lanterns floating creates movement and depth, enhancing rather than disrupting the scene's coherence. Their integration is consistent with cultural symbolism, further elevating the atmosphere.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite its stylized approach, Image B shows careful attention to retaining detail, including smooth textures and clearly defined colors. The stylization focuses on character design with deliberate choice of motifs and hues that adds to the thematic presentation, without introducing unrealistic textures or loss of clarity.",
