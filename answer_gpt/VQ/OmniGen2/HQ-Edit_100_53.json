      "question": "Does the kimono feature bold, clean outlines and uniformly flat color regions without gradient blending or photographic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is designed with bold outlines and flat color fills, which are characteristic of traditional Japanese art styles such as ukiyo-e. These styles typically have uniform color regions without gradient blending, aligning with woodblock printing techniques where separate blocks are used for different colors, resulting in a flat appearance. This contrasts with Image A, where the kimono has intricate patterns and texture, indicative of a photographic or highly detailed artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms represented with simplified, stylized shapes and muted pink hues, avoiding photorealistic detail or irregular clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms appear in simplified, stylized shapes with uniform, muted pink hues. This is typical of traditional Japanese art forms, which aim for an illustrative rendition rather than photorealism. The flowers lack the detailed texture and irregular clumping seen in the photorealistic approach of Image A, indicating a focus on artistic style rather than realism.",

      "question": "Do the path stones and vertical poles display textured patterns such as hatching, stippling, or woodgrain that align with traditional woodblock printing techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path stones and vertical poles are presented with clear outlines and flat colors, typical of the woodblock printing technique which does not emphasize textures like hatching or stippling. These elements are consistent with ukiyo-e style rendering, which favors simplicity and clarity over textural intricacy. Image A, however, depicts these with detailed textures, suggesting a more modern or photographic representation.",

      "question": "Is the figure's body proportionate and structurally sound, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure exhibits correct proportions and a natural pose. The structure of the body is sound, without any noticeable distortions or unnatural bending of limbs, suggesting adherence to traditional art proportions, similar to those found in ukiyo-e which often maintain idealized and harmonious human anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the distant hills depicted as simplified, layered forms with flat colors and clear outlines, consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape conventions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hills are presented with simplified shapes, flat colors, and clear outlines. This approach matches the ukiyo-e style known for its abstract representation of landscapes, avoiding intricate detail in favor of a clean, stylized look. Unlike Image A, which may display a more detailed or textural representation, this simplified depiction emphasizes the artistic style's influence.",
