    "Question": "Q1: Does the characterâ€™s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, we can deduce from the surrounding context that the transformation to a cartoon style allows for nuanced proportions typical of animation art, often featuring exaggerated or stylized forms. This usually results in smooth contours without drastic distortion unless intentionally abstract, which does not seem to be the case here given the realistic rendering of other elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The book in Image B retains its geometric structure with consistent page thickness and aligned edges, much like a real book would. In both images, the book appears realistically rendered, observing consistent angles and proportions akin to real-world objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric of the sleeves has smooth contours and realistic shadowing, resembling the natural behavior of textile under light. The shadow depth and fold patterns appear consistent with gravity, similar to dynamic fabric movement in real life.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden filigree details are depicted with clear rendering and seamless integration into the button surfaces. The edges retain fluidity typical of high-detail paintings, avoiding artifacts like jagged edges that mark amateur modifications.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B replaces the library shelves with a wooden frame and background, showing consistent wood grain and edge alignment throughout the frame. The depth cues provided by the shadowing and color gradients support three-dimensional spatial logic without any signs of broken geometry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
