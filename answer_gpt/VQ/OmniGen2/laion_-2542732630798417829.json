    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish design of eyes and a mouth are visibly applied to the surface of the bulb, yet they do not interfere with the visibility of the internal filament. This indicates that the artwork is placed strategically so as not to obscure or distort the bulb's inherent structure, showing a well-considered design that respects the bulb's transparency and functionality.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bulb is depicted with additional elements in a cartoon style. The lines forming the arms seem to follow the curvature of the surrounding structure smoothly without any visual discontinuity, indicating that the design continues the bulb's outline naturally and cohesively, without geometrical anomalies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the metal cage appears complete with its loops connected uniformly around the bulb, maintaining symmetry in its arrangement. There are no noticeable gaps or distortions, suggesting that the cage's integrity is preserved in the edit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears consistent with the cartoon bulb's glow, casting shadows and affecting reflections of nearby objects in the environment accordingly. This illustrates a thoughtful integration of the bulb's luminosity affecting its surroundings in a logical and consistent stylistic manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, colors are applied consistently, showcasing even distribution across different surfaces with vibrant yet controlled levels. There isn't any noticeable banding or color distortion, ensuring clarity and retaining the texture quality on glass, metal, and the surrounding background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are positioned away from the bulb and its metal cage. This ensures text clarity and prevents any overlap or obstruction with the bulb's components, making the cartoon narrative readable and coherent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon depiction in Image B, the arms are designed to smoothly trace the curvature of the bulb's silhouette and do not cross into the bulb or cage in any improbably structured ways. This reflects a consistent and plausible positioning in terms of design layout.",
