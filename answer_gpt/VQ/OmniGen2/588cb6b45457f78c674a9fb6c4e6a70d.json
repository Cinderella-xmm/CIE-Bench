    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the painted figure show consistent brushstroke patterns and subtle texture variations typical of oil paint on wood, without blocky or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) displays a polished digital painting style with vibrant colors and smooth gradients, lacking the characteristic brushstroke patterns and texture variations found in oil paintings on wood. This observation is based on the uniformity and brightness typical of digital art, contrasting with the uneven textures found in physical media.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the strands of the elongated beard and mustache maintain continuous, fiber-like structure without forming unnatural loops, droplets, or fluid-like surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beard and mustache exhibit a smooth, stylized appearance common in digital art. The strands are well-defined, maintaining a continuous, fiber-like structure without unnatural formations like loops or fluid-like surfaces. The style prioritizes clean lines and sharp, continuous shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture of the cloak smooth and reflective with depth, and are the golden embroidery lines evenly spaced and aligned with the fabric folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cloak with a sleek and consistent digital velvet texture, typical of computer-generated imagery. The golden embroidery lines are symmetrically aligned and do not show irregular spacing or misalignment with any fabric folds, reflecting a precise digital design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed hat positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape, and are the peacock feathers attached along the brim with natural curvature and no clipping into the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the hat correctly positioned atop the character's head, maintaining the intended proportion and symmetry. The peacock feathers are also artfully placed with a natural-looking curvature and do not interfere or clip into the facial structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the brooch cast a soft shadow onto the cloak and reflect light consistently with its surroundings, indicating proper placement and integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brooch appears to be integrated into the cloak harmoniously, as digital shading can accurately represent consistent light reflection and subtle shadowing typical in high-quality digital artwork, supporting a realistic placement without flaws.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the edges of the figure cleanly separated from the background without haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency that suggests poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is well-rendered, with the edges of the figure distinctly separated from the background, showcasing no signs of haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency, which indicates excellent compositing typical in professional digital artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment of the alignment and proportional consistency of facial features in Image B cannot be fully completed due to the blurred face, which renders these specific attributes indiscernible.",
