      "question": "Do the wombat's eyes appear naturally large and expressive without any distortion or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat's eyes are designed to be large and expressive, giving it a cute, animated look typical of chibi-style illustrations. Such designs do not typically distort the natural view as these features are intentionally exaggerated part of the style. There are no visible artifacts that detract from this purpose. Considering this description, the eyes appear naturally large and expressive without any distortion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the Hawaiian shirt and straw hat with stylized simplicity typical in chibi illustrations. The shirt's pattern is present, as are the hat's key characteristics, including its color and shape. While less detailed than in Image A, this is a stylistic choice rather than loss of detail. Given this understanding, there are no unnatural artifacts or significant loss of detail in Image B.",
