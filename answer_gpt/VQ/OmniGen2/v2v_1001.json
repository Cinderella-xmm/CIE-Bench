      "question": "Does the ketchup bottle in the lower-right corner appear naturally integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ketchup bottle is positioned in the lower-right corner of the image, contrasting with the misty forest background. The lighting on the bottle is consistent with the rest of the image, with no visible artifacts or harsh edges that would indicate poor integration. However, its presence is somewhat anachronistic due to the contextual mismatch with the otherwise prehistoric scene.",

      "question": "Does the text \"The king of flavors\" appear to float naturally in the air and blend seamlessly with the mist, without any distortion or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'The king of flavors' appears to float in the scene. Its shadowing and minor glowing effect give it a three-dimensional aspect that makes it appear suspended in the mist. The text is clearly readable and does not exhibit any distortion, blending effectively with the overall foggy ambiance of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the streams of ketchup linking back to the opened bottle physically plausible and free from any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible streams of ketchup linking back to the opened bottle indicated in the scenario. Therefore, this question assumes an error in description as there are no such streams present that could be evaluated for plausibility.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the dinosaur retain its natural appearance and structural consistency without any distortion or unnatural changes due to the added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain the dinosaur from Image A. Instead, it features edited elements such as text and a bottle. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered as it involves comparing an element that does not appear in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the forest background remain authentic and detailed, without any noticeable loss of details or introduction of artifacts due to the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest background retains its misty and atmospheric appearance and detailed texture, similar to Image A. The editing does not introduce any noticeable artifacts or loss of detail, as the added elements (the text and the ketchup bottle) are superimposed over the background without altering its intrinsic details.",
