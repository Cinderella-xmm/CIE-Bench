      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger features smooth, well-defined textures that align with common styling in animated or cartoon formats. There is a consistent use of shading and light which maintains the structural integrity of the character. Chibi designs have distinct, exaggerated features, such as the large eyes and small mouth, and the 3D rendering preserves these qualities without loss of detail. The textures, from the fur of the tiger to the skateboard, appear natural within the context of a stylized illustration.",

      "question": "Does the whimsical park backdrop with soft pastel hues, cherry blossom trees, and rose petals appear photorealistic and integrate naturally with the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The park backdrop in Image B uses vibrant pastel colors, which are characteristic of a whimsical, fairy-tale aesthetic rather than photorealism. The blurred background with cherry blossom trees and rose petals creates a dreamy atmosphere that complements the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger. While not photorealistic, the colors and elements are harmonious with the cartoon style, ensuring a cohesive integration. Photorealism is not the intent here; rather, a harmonious and enchanting environment is achieved.",

      "question": "Does the romantic floral arch in the distance enhance the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral arch, rendered with soft lines and pastel hues, contributes to the overall whimsical setting. It is well-integrated into the scene, maintaining visual consistency with the rest of the park backdrop. The arch fits naturally within the aesthetic of cherry blossoms and colorful elements, without displaying artifacts or disruptions in design. The placement and style of the arch support the narrative of a romantic, playful setting, enhancing rather than detracting from the visual flow.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger holding the skateboard realistic and does the action of holding the skateboard appear physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger is intentionally designed with exaggerated, chibi proportions such as a larger head and cute, rounded features. This style inherently encourages unrealistic proportioning compared to real-life equivalents, yet these proportions are typical for such designs. The tiger's posture and grip on the skateboard are artistically plausible within the context of this stylistic approach, ensuring that the action of holding the skateboard fits well with the genre of a chibi cartoon.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall presentation in Image B showcases a harmonious blend of the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger and the park setting. The cartoonish, vibrant aesthetic is consistently applied, with no visible artifacts or distortions disrupting the visual coherence. The elements, including the trees, petals, and floral arch, seamlessly integrate with the tiger character, contributing to the intended playful and whimsical theme. The image maintains its artistic authenticity within the chosen style, successfully achieving a well-coordinated scene.",
