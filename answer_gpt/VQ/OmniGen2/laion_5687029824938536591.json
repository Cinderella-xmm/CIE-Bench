        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe features triangular overlay shapes on the side that are meant to mimic the structural supports seen in many athletic shoes. The shapes appear to be visually intact, with no apparent warping or missing segments. They are meticulously integrated into what can be described as a wooden texture, which suggests a carefully crafted design to align with the shoe's structure.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoe in Image B uses darker and lighter wood tones to differentiate between various parts, such as the main body, toe cap, and midsole.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand name 'Salomon' on the shoe is clearly visible, while the text appears altered and slightly obscure, hindering readability.
