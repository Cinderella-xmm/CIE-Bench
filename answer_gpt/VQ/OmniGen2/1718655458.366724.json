      "question": "Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects include smooth spherical shapes prominently visible, alongside some cubic-like forms without the uniform prismatic geometry typical of LEGO bricks. There are still spherical objects which indicate that not all elements have been converted into LEGO brick shapes, as LEGO is generally characterized by its consistent block shape. The presence of smooth, rounded surfaces deviates from the standard blocky structure of LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the material finish of the objects appears glossy, displaying highlights and reflections typical of a polished surface. LEGO bricks typically have a matte finish, which minimizes reflections, thus the presence of visible specular highlights and reflections in the spherical objects contradicts the intended LEGO material's surface characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, there are some block-like structures with stud-like features visible; however, not all objects exhibit these interlocking characteristics. While some blue blocks show standard LEGO stud features, the white and marbled spheres do not align with this design. This inconsistency indicates that not all objects have the interlocking features standard to LEGO bricks.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, most elements are resting on a wooden shelf, depicting a stable and grounded arrangement. However, there are some small cubes and squares seemingly floating in mid-air above the rest of the structures. These floating pieces do not adhere to the laws of gravity, indicating that not all the elements are grounded appropriately.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a wooden surface, which inherently has textures and depth impressions associated with wood grain. These visual elements contribute to the depth cueing and are not entirely neutral or simplified. The use of a wooden texture conflicts with a completely minimalist and neutral background.",
