    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a serif font with a distressed gold texture that matches the typewriter’s material and color tone, and does it appear seamlessly integrated into the image without overlapping or obscuring key objects like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Stories Throughe' is prominently featured at the top, in a serif font with a distressed gold texture. This design choice complements the typewriter's vintage aesthetic, harmonizing with its material and color tone. The text is integrated into the composition without interfering with the typewriter, as it is placed on a separate layer from the typewriter, ensuring it doesn't overlap or obscure any other significant elements like the typewriter or lamp. This top-down integration maintains clarity of all visual components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sepia filter apply evenly across all elements—such as the wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall—without causing uneven color shifts, loss of texture detail, or artificial flattening of shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there's no even sepia filter applied as there was in the original Image A. Instead, the color scheme in Image B leans towards a monochromatic, vintage look with prominent brown tones, but lacks varied texture details and natural lighting on elements such as the desk, typewriter, and surrounding areas—compared to the textured details and depth of shadows and highlights visible in Image A due to its lack of color monotone. Thus, the texture detail is artificially flattened with some elements appearing less three-dimensional as seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ghostly pages positioned around the typewriter in a flowing, semi-transparent manner, avoiding sharp edges or unnatural overlaps with solid objects like the typewriter body or desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork features ghostly pages around the typewriter, emphasizing movement and transparency without sharp edges or stark contrast with the background. They are positioned in a way to avoid direct overlap with the typewriter's solid structure or desk surface, achieving a floating effect, whereas Image A's elements are solid and static, without any added flow or transparency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Art Deco border present along the edges of the image, featuring symmetrical geometric patterns and consistent thickness, without cutting into or distorting any central elements like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a decorative border of the Art Deco style lining the edges of the image. This border maintains consistent geometric patterns and thickness, carefully framing the central objects without encroaching or distorting the typewriter's shape or any key features, which are absent in Image A. Image A does not contain any border elements, which makes Image B's integration of Art Deco stylistics a clear design enhancement while ensuring other design elements remain unobstructed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the typewriter retain its original shape, alignment of keys, and mechanical structure without visible deformation, stretching, or broken geometry despite the addition of new elements like text and ghostly pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typewriter in Image B retains its vintage design integrity, including the shape and alignment of keys, and its mechanical structure shows consistent proportions. There are no visible deformations or distortions due to the additions of text and ghostly pages. Although stylistically reimagined, the structure remains intact similar to its portrayal in Image A, showcasing both images with a visually coherent typewriter motif.",
