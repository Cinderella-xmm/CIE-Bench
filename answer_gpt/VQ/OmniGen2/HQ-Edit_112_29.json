      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the ship retain its original structural shape and proportion when rendered as part of a spherical globe, without visible warping or stretching of the hull or sails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship inside the glass dome retains a compact and proportionate form, fitting neatly within the spherical globe. There is no visible distortion in the shipâ€™s hull or sails, which suggests that the ship maintains its original structural integrity. This is important when rendering in 3D or within a spherical surface, as distortion could appear if proper scaling is not done. The ship appears similar in proportion to traditional scale models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and does the wooden base display natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is transparent with realistic reflections, which are visible on its surface, indicating a high level of detail in the presentation of glass material. The reflections and refractions appear naturally curved as expected for a spherical glass object. The wooden base shows natural wood grain and features detailed compass engravings, which are well-defined and not pixelated, suggesting high-resolution texture, thus enhancing realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sea creatures clearly visible beneath the ship, properly scaled, and positioned in a manner consistent with underwater motion, without appearing floating unnaturally or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea creatures are visible beneath the ship, scaled and positioned to suggest they are in motion within a small enclosed environment. The arrangement and size of the creatures appear proportionate to the scale of the ship model, and their appearance suggests an understanding of how they might move in water. There is no visible distortion or unnatural floatation, which would imply an accurate and realistic portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit fine fabric details such as wrinkles and weave patterns that align with the lighting direction and do not show unnatural seams or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sails in Image B display a clean appearance with a smooth surface, and while they may not explicitly show detailed fabric textures like wrinkles or weave, they align well with the lighting direction, creating a convincing representation of fabric under natural light. There are no unnatural seams or repeating patterns that would detract from realism, suggesting fine detail work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the internal clouds smoothly shaped and distributed within the dome without clipping into the ship or glass surface, and do they have soft edges and luminous quality consistent with being lit from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The internal clouds in Image B are smoothly shaped and distributed, complementing the scene without intersecting the ship or the glass. They have soft edges that convey a fluffy appearance, and the clouds exhibit a luminous quality consistent with overhead lighting, giving them a realistic, ethereal presence akin to real clouds observed from above. There is no evidence of clipping into the ship or glass surface.",
