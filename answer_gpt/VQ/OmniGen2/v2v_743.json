      "question": "Does the chibi figurine emerge from the Polaroid frame without any visible breaks or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figurine in Image B appears seamlessly integrated within the Polaroid frame. There are no visible breaks or unnatural edges where the figurine meets the frame, indicating a smooth transition and integration. This is achieved through clean and cohesive editing that maintains the integrity of the figurine's form within the frame.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi figurine consistent with its interaction with the Polaroid frame and the human hand, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the chibi figurine are consistent with typical scaling standards for chibi or small figurines within a photo frame. The figurine fits comfortably within the frame and interacts with the human hand in a manner that avoids distortion. It is proportional in size relative to the fingers holding the Polaroid photograph, suggesting a realistic scaling.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi figurine retain clear and natural textures, especially in areas like clothing and hair, without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figurine maintains detailed textures in areas such as clothing and hair. The clothing has visible creases and shading indicative of natural fabric texture, and the hair appears textured with distinct strands or styling that reflects attention to detail. This suggests that the figurine's design did not suffer from a loss of detail in these specific areas.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the yellow attire of the chibi figurine consistent in color and material with the original image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the yellow attire of the chibi figurine in Image B closely resembles the hue and material texture found in Image A. Both images depict the attire as a bright yellow with subtle shading that suggests a fabric-like material. These similar characteristics contribute to a cohesive and natural appearance for the chibi figurine.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph and the human hand holding it appear natural and structurally consistent, with no unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Polaroid photograph and the human hand holding it display structural consistency. The edges of the photograph are linear and sharp, typical of Polaroid prints. The hand appears naturally grasped around the photograph without distortion or awkward positioning. These elements combine to form an appearance that adheres to realistic physical interaction between the hand and the photograph.",
