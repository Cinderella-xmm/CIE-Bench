      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized sunflowers exhibit petals that are designed in an Art Nouveau style, characterized by smooth and continuous curves. There are no visible signs of broken or fragmented edges in the petals, which are well-defined and coherent. This is consistent with the flowing and organic nature of Art Nouveau design.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the dress follow the body's contours gracefully, with smooth lines typical of Art Nouveau design. The patterns are fluid without any abrupt angles or signs of fabric tension, displaying a natural and elegant drape.",

      "question": "Are the Art Nouveau patterns in the hair, dress, and background unified in line style, color palette, and scale, creating a cohesive visual composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a unified Art Nouveau style across the hair, dress, and background. The line style, color palette, and scale are consistently applied, creating a harmonious and cohesive visual composition. The elements beautifully complement each other within the artwork's overall design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details in the sunflower centers, hair braids, and facial features preserved and clearly defined, without noticeable blurring or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the stylization emphasizes certain Art Nouveau elements, some fine details, such as the sunflower centers and hair braids, are adapted to the style's smooth and flowing aesthetics. This sometimes results in a more stylized representation rather than a focus on ultra-fine detail. However, the question about facial features does not apply directly since the face is intentionally blurred. Overall, for the aspects visible, the stylization may sacrifice some of the original fine detail clarity.",
