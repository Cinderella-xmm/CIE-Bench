      "question": "Does the claymation texture applied to the cocktail glass maintain its structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass is designed with a claymation texture, giving it a slightly cartoonish and smoother appearance compared to realistic textures. The edges of the glass are coherent without irregularities, maintaining its structural integrity. The smooth surface is typical for a stylized representation without intricate glass details, which aligns with a claymation style. This reflects a creative approach rather than a precise imitation of reality, so it maintains coherence within its artistic context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ice cubes and liquid in the cocktail retain their visual plausibility and natural appearance after being converted into a claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes appear more stylized and blocky, resembling clay objects rather than realistic ice. The liquid appears uniformly colored and lacks the transparency or varying shadows typical of real liquid. Using world knowledge about claymation, this stylization does not aim for realism; rather, it offers a creative interpretation that may detract from natural appearance. Thus, while visually coherent within claymation, natural visual plausibility is compromised.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the lime slice and straw preserved without distortion in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime slice is slightly exaggerated in color and style, with vibrant, consistent texture common to claymation designs. The geometric form is preserved without evident distortion. Similarly, the straw is maintained in form, albeit with smoother, less detailed surfaces typical of stylized representation. The preservation of geometrical consistency aligns with the claymation design ethos, where simplification does not equate to distortion.",

      "question": "Does the background, including the bar counter and bottles, retain its structural integrity and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the claymation-styled Image B, the background elements like the bar counter and bottles keep their general structure but are simplified, focusing less on realistic detail. The bottles are stylized with uniform, simplified features, typical of claymation. This representation avoids unnatural artifacts but emphasizes artistic style over realism, coherent within its design and expected in claymation interpretations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects logically consistent in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects maintaining their logical proportions and spatial relationships. The napkin remains beneath the glass, appropriately sized for stylization, while the glass size follows typical proportional guidelines as it sits on the counter. The coherence in positioning suggests a thoughtful arrangement despite the artistic style shift, keeping logical consistency intact.",
