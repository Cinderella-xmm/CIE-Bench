    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the olive and dark green LEGO bricks covering the tank's body uniformly aligned and textured, without visible gaps, misaligned blocks, or distorted shapes that break the geometric structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks covering the tank are assessed for alignment, texture consistency, and overall geometric integrity. The visual cues suggest a uniform arrangement without any gaps, misaligned blocks, or distorted shapes, as LEGO bricks are typically designed to fit together seamlessly. Comparing this with the original tank, we see a transformation into a LEGO model, but the analysis focuses solely on the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the colorful LEGO tiger pattern on the front hull maintain the correct proportions and facial features of the original tiger decal, without distortion or missing elements such as eyes, teeth, or stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual representation of the tiger pattern on Image B, constructed with LEGO bricks, is compared for accuracy in terms of proportions and facial features. The LEGO interpretation maintains the key elements of eyes, teeth, and stripes without distortion, keeping the essence of the original tiger decal seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the LEGO treads exhibit consistent, detailed texture resembling real tank tracks, with no flattened sections or incorrect spacing between the individual tread segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO treads, as seen in Image B, are examined for their ability to mimic the detailed texture and arrangement of real tank tracks. The visual cues suggest that the tread pattern is consistently constructed, with regular spacing and no flattened sections, aligning with how LEGO pieces could replicate such features. This is compared to the realistic tank treads in Image A for assessment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO tank fully supported by a smooth, continuous wooden platform that matches the surrounding ground level, with no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the LEGO tank on a wooden platform, assessed for support integrity, continuity, and alignment with the surrounding ground level. The analysis indicates a smooth platform without any floating or misaligned edges, consistent with the intended presentation of structured LEGO creations. Comparing with Image A, which has the tank on a gravel base, highlights the difference but ensures thorough analysis of B's support.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the green LEGO brick back panel blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, showing no sharp edges, unnatural color shifts, or textural inconsistencies compared to the real foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The back panel of green LEGO bricks in Image B is evaluated for its integration with the environment, looking for seamless blending in terms of texture and color without awkward transitions from the LEGO structure to real surroundings. While LEGO typically has a distinct texture, the visual impression suggests a deliberate attempt to match the environment, though less natural than the organic foliage in Image A.",
