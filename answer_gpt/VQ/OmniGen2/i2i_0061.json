      "question": "Does the watercolor effect applied across the image retain the structural coherence of the skater's pose and the ramp's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's pose and the ramp's form are still recognizable despite the watercolor effect. The legs, arms, and overall body position of the skater remain in a coherent and dynamic stance. The ramp's shape is maintained, providing a clear context of the skater's activity. The watercolor effect does not distort the essential structure of the skater or the ramp.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors used for the ground and background buildings free from unnatural textures and artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smooth transition of colors with the brushstroke style, maintaining a semi-abstract look without introducing awkward textures or artifacts. The watercolor style blends naturally into the scenery, maintaining a pleasing aesthetic that complements the abstract pattern, especially in representing the sky and distant buildings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the skater’s body and clothing retained their proportions and physical rationality after applying the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skater's body in Image B retains its original proportions and looks physically reasonable. The arms, legs, and overall posture correspond to realistic human dimensions. The watercolor style does not compromise the anatomy of the skater as the pose and clothing appear proportionate.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes remain discernible after the watercolor treatment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details on the skater’s gray t-shirt and black shoes are less discernible due to the watercolor effect. The brushstroke style generalizes the texture and shading of the clothing, which results in the loss of finer details like logos or specific design elements that might have been visible in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the shapes and lines of the skater’s hands remained ergonomic and natural under the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's hands have retained mostly natural shapes and ergonomics. Despite the watercolor treatment, the hands and fingers are still depicted in a way that reflects a realistic pose, crucial for maintaining the dynamic motion of the skater.",
