    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the raised structures on the car's hood resemble button-like structures that are symmetrically placed on each side of the car, suggesting a design change from the original gullwing doors visible in Image A. The structures appear smooth and part of the car's design, without any visible warping or clipping, which indicate the smooth transitions from the body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a prominent front grille that does not resemble a traditional design. Instead, the grille has angular and segmented patterns that suggest a modern interpretation. However, this does not align with the description of a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad, as the segments do not distinctly form this shape or structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's exterior is a consistent metallic red shade, and it reflects light in a realistic manner with smooth gloss highlights which follow the car's curves. There are no abrupt transitions or flat areas visually disrupting the overall consistency, suggesting careful attention to detail in modeling and rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interior of the car is not clearly visible in Image B; thus, it is difficult to ascertain the details about a dashboard emblem resembling a central control button. Without a view into the interior dashboard area, there is insufficient information to confirm the presence of a detailed emblem as described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the carâ€™s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a circular emblem positioned centrally on the hood, replacing the traditional Mercedes logo seen in Image A. This emblem has defined edges and appears to be aligned with the car's longitudinal axis without noticeable tilting or stretching, suggesting alignment consistency and integration with the car's design.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edited components (shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, hood logo) fully attached to the car body with no floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the components such as the button-like structures on the hood, the modified grille, and the emblem appear to be fully attached to the car body. There is no visual indication of floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends; all components appear integrated with the design.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections at the boundaries of edited regions (e.g., door edges, grille perimeter, hood logo)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B closely, there are no visible artifacts like jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections around the boundaries of the edited regions such as the button structures, grille, or hood logo. The image quality appears smooth and seamless, indicating good editing work.",
