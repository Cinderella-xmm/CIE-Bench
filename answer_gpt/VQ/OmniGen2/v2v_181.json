      "question": "Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sheep and the clock have been styled with a chibi or cartoonish appearance, characterized by exaggerated features and simplified designs. The sheep has a fluffy body texture and distinct features, while the clock maintains clarity in its shape, numbers, and hands. There are no noticeable unnatural textures or loss of detail, as they both appear well-rendered and stylized, which aligns with common 3D modeling techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sheep appear naturally leaning against the clock without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is positioned next to the clock inside the snow globe. The spacing and orientation suggest that the sheep is placed naturally relative to the clock without appearing to lean or be supported by it. Common sense suggests that in a snow globe, objects are fixed and would not require support, hence the sheep does not appear distorted or unnaturally positioned.",

      "question": "Do the gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe add to the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, small light spots resembling snowflakes are visible, which add to the winter or holiday theme typically associated with snow globes. These elements do not seem to introduce visual disruptions or artifacts, thus appearing as a natural and cohesive part of the scene. This falls in line with common expectations for snow globes, where such features add visual interest.",

      "question": "Does the wooden tabletop and warm, neutral-toned background create a visually harmonious and cozy atmosphere without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden tabletop under the snow globe and the warm background tones create a cozy and harmonious visual setting. This combination is consistent with creating a warm, inviting ambiance, which fits well with the soft lighting and the overall theme of the image. There are no discordant elements that disrupt the harmony of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop consistent and logical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe with the sheep and clock proportionately scaled to fit inside, sitting on a wooden tabletop. The size relationships between the figure of the sheep, the clock, and the snow globe seem consistent, fitting what would be expected in such a setting. The tabletop provides a stable base for the globe, maintaining logical physical relationships within the scene.",
