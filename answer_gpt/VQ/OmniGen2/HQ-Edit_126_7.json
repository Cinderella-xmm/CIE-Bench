    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cat’s body exhibit a smooth, flowing mist-like texture with a consistent sky-blue hue that blends naturally without sharp edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body reveals a sky-blue hue that transitions smoothly across its surface, giving the appearance of a mist-like texture. The color is spread consistently, indicating careful blending. Using world knowledge of digital art techniques, this blending seems intentional to represent a fantasy element without sharp edges or pixelation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the swirling cumulus cluster positioned atop the cat’s head in a way that follows natural cloud formation and integrates seamlessly with the head’s shape without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formation appears naturally above the cat's head, as if resting upon it. The placement aligns well with the curvature of the cat's head, suggesting an integrated design choice inspired by natural cloud positioning, rather than misalignment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cloud patterns integrated into the cat’s body in a way that respects the original fur direction and does not cause visible distortion or unnatural layering over the striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the cat's body features cloud patterns, these patterns align with the contour and natural flow of the cat’s fur direction without any apparent disruption or distortion. The original stripe pattern is preserved, showcasing seamless layering consistent with a skilled editing technique.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the translucent wings have a soft, ethereal appearance with subtle cloud swirls and are they attached to the cat’s body in a way that preserves anatomical plausibility and spatial consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents wings with cloud-like swirls, creating a soft, ethereal visual effect. The wings are attached at an angle and position that maintains plausible body anatomical structure and spatial consistency, integral for fantasy-themed digital renders.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vapor trails and eye swirls smoothly rendered and aligned with the cat’s facial contours, avoiding jagged lines or misplaced streaks that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vapor trails and eye swirls are depicted with smooth rendering, following the cat's facial contour and symmetry. Utilizing digital art knowledge, they demonstrate meticulous detailing that avoids jagged or misplaced elements, ensuring a polished, artifact-free finish.",
