    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the mannequin's body exhibit a consistent weathered stone texture throughout, without patches of remaining metallic sheen or abrupt material changes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mannequin's body appears to have a consistent texture that resembles a smooth, polished material, which could be a modern representation or a metallic material. There are no abrupt changes in material or noticeable weathered stone texture that would indicate a rough or eroded stone surface. Instead, the surface appears uniform and polished. This suggests that the texture focuses more on a clean and refined appearance rather than a weathered look.",

The limbs are positioned in a natural and balanced manner, with a slight bend at the elbow and relaxed hand placement.

The surface has an even finish with natural-looking shadows that follow the contours, avoiding any distortion or artificial highlights.
