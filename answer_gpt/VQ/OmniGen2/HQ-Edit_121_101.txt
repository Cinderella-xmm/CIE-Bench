    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the jacket feature very sharp and clean edges characteristic of a paper-cut style. The metallic foil highlights on the patterns are consistent and uniform, showing no signs of smudging or bleeding into other colors. Such precision suggests a well-crafted, high-quality design true to paper-cut aesthetics.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bow is part of a digital or illustrative design depicting traditional Korean attire. The bow's illustration shows symmetry and the absence of prominent creasing or distortion. However, given that the bow is now a digital element, the fabric folds appear designed to preserve aesthetic smoothness and symmetry.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hand depicted seems to be an illustration along with the rest of the elements. However, despite the illustrative style, it maintains the proper joint curvature and skin texture. The chain follows a continuous path, avoiding intersections and appearing seamlessly part of the overall piece, maintaining continuity and aesthetic appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
