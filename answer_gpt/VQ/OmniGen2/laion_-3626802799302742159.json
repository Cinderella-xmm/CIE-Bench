      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) and limbs added to the cookies smooth, proportionally consistent with the cookie size, and free from pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the added facial features and limbs on the cookies are clearly visible and appear smooth and proportionate in relation to the cookie size. The edges of these features lack pixelation, and there are no noticeable jagged edges, indicating a well-executed addition to the cookies. World knowledge would suggest that pixelation and jagged edges are often indicators of poor editing or low-resolution images, which are absent in this case.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the transformed plate appear continuous, evenly distributed, and consistent with fabric texture, without visible seams or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the plate now has a floral pattern with evenly distributed flowers that cover the plateâ€™s surface. The pattern is consistent with a fabric design and there are no visible seams or signs of unnatural stretching. The flowers have a uniform appearance with consistent color and shape across the plate, demonstrated by their well-spaced arrangement. World knowledge informs us that fabric patterns may show stretching or seams in poorly executed edits, which are absent here.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the added miniature chairs and tea table positioned within the cup and around it in a way that respects physical proportions and does not cause overlapping or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, miniature chairs are positioned around the cookies and display proper alignment with the cookie characters, maintaining physical proportions. The elements within the scene appear stationary and appropriately placed, meaning there are no overlaps that suggest unrealistic positioning or floating objects. Knowledge of object placement and proportions helps ensure that items appear natural and correctly grounded.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions on the cookies (grinning, pouting, winking) show clear differentiation in mouth and eye shapes while maintaining symmetry and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies' facial expressions display distinct changes in mouth and eye shapes, such as grinning, pouting, and winking. These expressions are well-differentiated, with clear and symmetrical design and curvature that aligns with typical cartoon depictions of emotions. World knowledge recognizes that symmetry and curvature are crucial to defining clear expressions in drawings, enhancing recognizability and appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the positions of the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table arranged in a way that suggests stable contact with surfaces and realistic depth, without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates that cookie characters, chairs, and tea table are all positioned securely, providing a convincing depiction of depth and stable contact with surfaces. The arrangement avoids floating objects, ensuring realistic presence and proportionate height as per world knowledge of object interaction with surfaces in a scene. The stable positioning reinforces the natural appearance of the entire setup.",
