    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the drone are centered on the body with a consistent angular design akin to a robotic face. The features are symmetrical and fit well with the design, showing no apparent texture artifacts or distortions of shape. The consistency and clarity of the facial outlines and details on the drone suggest a purposeful, uniform look without misalignment or distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rotor arms in Image B are proportionate, with blades appearing to attach smoothly to the central structure. Each rotor blade is straight and well-aligned with the rest of the drone, indicating a design aimed at functional rotation and aerodynamic efficiency. There are no visible signs of warping or breakage, suggesting a cohesive build.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider-like legs appear to be correctly connected at the original landing gear points, maintaining coherent structural integrity. The joints look solid and well-integrated into the design without conspicuous gaps or parts appearing to float unnaturally, indicating a sound construction appropriate for support or landing functions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B complements the futuristic cityscape, casting realistic metallic reflections on the drone's surface. The light highlights the edges and features of the drone without any glaring discrepancies or abrupt transitions, successfully blending the drone into the environment. This suggests intent and technical coherence within the scene's lighting design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is strategically placed near the drone's robotic face, ensuring the text is clear and legible. The bubble's location avoids overlap with any drone components or background elements, maintaining visibility and clarity of communication within the image while ensuring the message is directly conveyed.",
