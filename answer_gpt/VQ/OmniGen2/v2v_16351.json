      "question": "Does the luxurious piece of designer furniture appear proportionally correct and physically plausible in place of the jersey display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a luxurious piece of designer furniture, most likely a bench or ottoman, is positioned where the jersey display was. The proportions of the furniture relative to the room and other objects such as the side table and lamp appear correct. The bench's size and shape fit into the showroom without any awkward scaling, which suggests a physically plausible addition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters' gestures, such as giving a thumbs-up, suit the context of admiring or showcasing the showroom and its elements, including the designer furniture and displayed jersey.

      "question": "Is the lighting and shadow in the showroom consistent with the new setting, without introducing any unnatural or inconsistent effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent with a showroom setup and enhances the mid-century modern aesthetic. Light sources like recessed lighting and a lamp are appropriately rendered, and shadows are cast naturally from the furniture and other objects. There are no signs of mismatched lighting or shadow inconsistencies that would detract from the realism of the scene.",

      "question": "Have the characters and their clothing remained visually consistent and unchanged, aside from the background and the jersey display being replaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the characters and their clothing appear unchanged between the images. The modifications were limited to the background and the jersey display, which aligns with the question's context. Therefore, aside from these changes, the characters have been preserved in their original depiction.",
