      "question": "Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylization of the man's body maintains correct proportions and natural joint articulation. The limbs, including the arms and legs, are depicted in a manner that respects the basic human anatomy. The tuxedo's fitting and the body's stance suggest an understanding of realistic bodily proportions, even within a stylized illustration. Comparing with Image A, where the man's posture is natural, Image B retains these anatomical beliefs despite being stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures, lines, and shading of both the tuxedo and the fur jacket are maintained to give them a certain plausibility and depth. The tuxedo appears with defined lapels and subtle shading that suggests fabric folds, while the fur jacket displays fur-like patterns. These renderings show an attempt to provide a believable texture despite the stylized form, sharing a similar realistic representation seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background does not include the FIA logo and sponsor names in the manner seen in Image A. Instead, Image B focuses on the illustrated stamp element with no logos or text applicable in the background area. This divergence signifies that the simpler backdrop of Image B does not encompass the specific informational elements present in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold ribbon-like border around the stamp is not visible as closed and appears to taper off, lacking uniform thickness. This lack of closure and inconsistency in thickness implies it doesn't fully adhere to a symmetrical or even pattern. This differs from the edited design's purpose, where such detailing is typically avoided in stylization compared to Image A's complete formality.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed logo on the blue envelope in Image B is designed to show depth and surface texture through the use of shading and highlights. However, the simplified background and the overly stylized element may not display the true textured detail and consistent depth that realistic embossing requires, as would be expected when compared to the genuine texturing in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stamp appears flat on the envelope without distinct shadowing or perspective cues that would suggest a physical attachment or dimensionality. The missing shadows and flat depiction disrupt the illusion of physical attachment, which is something carefully crafted in real-life scenarios for depth perception. Therefore, the representation in Image B lacks the shadowing and perspective complexities as seen in realistic settings.",

      "question": "Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the individuals' hands are not depicted on the visible areas of the illustration, thus not providing enough visual information to confirm the presence of five fingers on each hand or their shape. In comparison with Image A, where the man's hand is visible, Image B skips this detail in its artistic rendition.",
