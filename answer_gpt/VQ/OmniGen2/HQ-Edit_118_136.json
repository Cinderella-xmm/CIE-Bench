      "question": "Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the skater clad in futuristic armor. The visual cues suggest that the armor is designed to fit the skater's body in a realistic manner, reflecting common design principles for protective gear which maintain anatomical proportions. The armor appears snug and properly segmented to avoid stretched shapes or unnatural bends, demonstrating the designer's attention to detail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hoverboardâ€™s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hoverboard features a transparent deck, which is seamlessly constructed with consistent glowing effects. The visual consistency in edge shaping and positioning of glow effects suggests a coherent design, showing an understanding of advanced technology. There are no signs of broken edges or misplaced effects, ensuring the hoverboard's visual integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The description of graffiti as animated digital displays suggests a modern, clean design that avoids the typical characteristics of static paint, such as pixelation or jagged outlines. However, upon analysis of the skater scene, the graffiti appears static, akin to traditional paint seen in urban environments, despite possible individual preferences in artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard are depicted with soft and consistent glows, as observed through their interaction with the surroundings. The glow effects enhance the futuristic city ambiance without creating harsh reflections or color bleed in a manner consistent with the principles of light diffusion and digital art design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the skater's motion in the edited image, the lines are strategically placed along the trajectory to emphasize movement. The placement is intuitive, enhancing the sense of speed and motion without intersecting or overlapping with key features of the character or hoverboard in a way that would seem implausible, reflecting understanding of motion dynamics.",
