    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jigsaw pieces are clearly visible, and their edges appear smooth and designed to interlock neatly without gaps. Each piece maintains its shape, with visual cues suggesting that they can fit together precisely without deformities. This is consistent with the typical design of puzzle pieces, intended to fit seamlessly into one another.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon patterns are in a darker wood stain, providing a contrast against the lighter wood stain of the central compass area. The transition between these areas is smooth and natural, without sharp or unnatural changes. This is indicative of quality woodwork where different stains are used to highlight distinct features without abrupt transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wood grain texture is apparent and shows a natural variation across the pieces. The grain appears organic and does not have repeating patterns that would suggest artificial manipulation or excessive smoothing. Natural wood grain typically exhibits diverse patterns, contributing to its authenticity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are scattered around the central object, laying flat on the surface without signs of defying gravity or perspective. Each piece is alongside the wood surface, giving a realistic appearance as if they were simply placed there without overlapping or appearing as if they are levitating.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central compass is circular with intricately detailed engravings. The lines and divisions within the compass are precise and well-defined, maintaining the intended circular shape without distortion. This demonstrates a high level of craftsmanship typically expected in such detailed woodwork designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
