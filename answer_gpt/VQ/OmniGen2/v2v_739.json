      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style character maintain natural proportions without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is depicted in a 3D chibi style, which traditionally features an exaggerated head size compared to body proportions, but this is by design and not considered distorted. There are no signs of broken geometric shapes, indicating that the character design is intentional and consistent with the chibi art style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question appears to pertain to Image A, as Image B does not depict hands or a phone. Since the query is about Image B, which lacks these elements, there is no basis for analysis.",
