    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, which features a castle made of icy crystal structures, the facets of the crystal align seamlessly with the vertical and horizontal geometry of the castle towers, reflecting consistent craftsmanship. The visual cues suggest clean lines and symmetry typical of finely cut crystals without any visible irregularities, implying attention to detail and precision in the shape alignment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gemstones on the castle platform are arranged meticulously as though replacing seashells, which would have been part of the marine scene originally. They have smooth surfaces and are visually grounded on the frosted base, exhibiting no signs of floating or misalignment. The reflective texture further supports their accurate emulation of polished gemstones.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a frosted glass surface that mimics the original image's oceanic context. However, upon visual inspection, there aren't any evident wave patterns on this surface, rather it’s a stark bluish-white display serving more to showcase the crystal architecture rather than replicate a wave motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the display case in Image B are discernible and uniformly parallel, preserving the scene's internal integrity and perspective. The exhibit alignment suggests structured visualization, possibly indicative of precise modeling or digital rendering techniques, free of any visual distortions that might disrupt its straight edge presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldn’t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is devoid of the red shovel with yellow handle originally visible in Image A. Image B is a transformation into a glass model lacking such elements, resulting in a reorganized tableau where the shovel is not present nor should appear behind any glass fixtures as it’s entirely absent.",
