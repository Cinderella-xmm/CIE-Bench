    "Question": "Q2: Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
    "explanation": "The glass façade in Image B is characterized by its clean and continuous vertical edges. The light transmission through the glass appears realistic, allowing the background illumination to pass through without distortion, suggesting good optical properties and well-defined form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Savanna Essence' clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The text 'Savanna Essence' in Image B is clearly visible, positioned at the base of the figures. It is rendered with sharp edges and a consistent font style, demonstrating high clarity and alignment with the design aesthetic without any signs of blurring or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",
    "explanation": "The cheetah figures in Image B retain their sitting posture similar to the original, with well-proportioned limbs and torso. There is no visible distortion in anatomical features, showing consistent proportions and a natural depiction of the form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures are symmetrically positioned on either side of the central glass façade. The shadows cast by the figures match the directionality of the lighting and surface reflection, indicating symmetry and consistent environmental illumination.",
    "answer": "Yes"
