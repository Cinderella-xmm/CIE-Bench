      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character's transformation into an anime-style action figure maintain natural textures and fine details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are stylized into a cartoonish, anime-style action figure format. Anime-style figures typically have smooth surfaces with less emphasis on fine textures and details due to their simplified design. This is evident in the figure's uniform skin tone and simplified clothing folds. Hence, the transformation aligns with the common characteristics of anime figures and does not introduce unnatural artifacts specific to this style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the box design seamlessly integrate with the rest of the image, maintaining visual credibility without disrupting the overall scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B appears well-integrated with the rest of the scene. Its design, colors, and positioned contents align with the action figure theme, consistent with toy store displays. The shading, reflection, and perspective match the environmental lighting, creating a cohesive visual that doesn't disrupt the image's continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the airplane-related elements incorporated into the box design proportionally correct and physically rational, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airplane model in Image B is designed proportionally with the figures and the box size. The elements appear as miniature, well-crafted models that fit within the scale of action figures. This suggests a toy set scenario where proportionality and rationality in size and shape are observed, avoiding distortions or awkward dimensions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character's dynamic pose atop the small airplane wing appear structurally consistent and visually credible, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character standing on the airplane model's wing in Image B appears to be properly scaled and structured for a toy figure. The pose is consistent with action figures, which often exhibit static, balanced positioning. There's no visible deformation that suggests a lack of credibility in pose, considering this is a stylized representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the hyper-realistic figure beside the box rendered realistically and naturally, resembling a professionally photographed product?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the figure in simplified, smooth surfaces consistent with toy figures rather than hyper-realistic depictions. This stylization is typical of manufactured figures intended for display in boxed packaging seen in toy stores, rather than realism-focused sculptures or models.",
