      "question": "Does the transparent acrylic display case show no visible distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that affect the appearance of the McLaren?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent acrylic display encases the car, showcasing sharp edges and a clean surface. The car within the case appears clear and undistorted. Analyzing the visual function of such materials in design, acrylic often minimally impacts how objects inside appear. There are no visible distortions or refraction errors affecting the car's appearance, based on its presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the polished chrome base aligned with the car's position and does it reflect light and surroundings naturally without appearing disconnected or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the McLaren sitting on a polished chrome base, reflecting light evenly and consistently around the car. This matches common expectations of polished surfaces interacting with light. The base is integrated well with the setup and doesn't appear disconnected or provide unnatural reflections related to the car's position.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the carbon fiber textures confined to the interior walls of the display case and do they exhibit consistent, non-repeating patterns without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Carbon fiber patterns in design are known for their consistency. Image B displays such textures on the walls of the case, confined to specific areas. They appear consistent and uniform, without repetition errors or artifacts, aligning with manufacturing standards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature wrenches and screwdrivers proportionally accurate compared to the McLaren and positioned in a way that suggests intentional placement without floating or clipping through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tools such as wrenches and screwdrivers alongside the car. They are placed on the base proportionally to the car's size, suggesting intentional design for display purposes. Their placement on the base appears secure without the tools floating or clipping, maintaining realism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the laser-etched cityscape silhouette positioned at a consistent depth behind the car and display case, with no overlapping or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape silhouette is etched on the acrylic display case's interior. It maintains a consistent depth and does not interfere with the car or any components placed within. Overlapping or clipping would cause visual confusion with components inside, but here it stays clear of such issues.",
