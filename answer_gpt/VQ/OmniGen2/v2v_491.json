      "question": "Does the bear maintain precise proportions and intricate fur details in its anime-inspired form without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear has been inspired by anime style, which usually exaggerates certain features for stylistic effect. The face and body proportions of the bear in Image B appear more rounded and stylized compared to Image A, which represents a realistic bear. The fur in Image B lacks the intricate details seen in realistic representations, opting instead for a smoother, more simplified texture that is characteristic of anime style. This alteration in proportions and details is common in anime adaptations to reflect a specific aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the bear's fur natural and free of any obvious artifacts in the anime-inspired figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear's fur appears more like a smooth, cartoonish texture instead of a realistically detailed one. This is consistent with the anime style, which often sacrifices textural complexity for simplicity and visual smoothness. The absence of realistic fur intricacies is intentional and not due to artifacts but instead reflects a stylistic choice typical in anime forms.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the backpack realistically scaled down and positioned next to the bear on the desk, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is positioned next to the anime-inspired bear on the desk. It is proportionally consistent with the scale of the bear, matching the smaller and more stylized form of the bear seen in anime. The backpack's sleek and polished look fits well within the anime aesthetic scene, aligning visually in terms of perspective and size relative to the bear. The positioning and scaling appear intentional and credible within the context of the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bear's emotive eyes retain their fine details and appear natural without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear’s eyes are styled in an anime fashion, characterized by a large and expressive quality that fits the overall design. While they may appear less detailed compared to a realistic depiction, this is in line with the simplified and exaggerated features common in anime style. There is no evidence of unintended unnatural textures or artifacts—only a stylistic choice to achieve the intended appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and lighting of the scene, including the bear and the backpack, convey a casual, natural vibe similar to a smartphone capture without any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows are consistent and realistic, but the actual aesthetic is more polished and controlled, typical of anime-influenced artwork rather than a casual, natural smartphone capture. The image lacks the spontaneity and casual framing expected in smartphone photography due to its composed and illustrative style. No obvious artifacts are present, but the stylization diverges from a purely casual aesthetic.",
