      "question": "Are the details and textures of the skateboarder and the urban background preserved despite the application of the faded effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faded effect appears to reduce the overall brightness, which might obscure some detail. Despite this, upon examining the skateboarder and urban background, features such as clothing texture and individual tree branches, although darker, are still noticeably present. This indicates that details and textures are largely preserved, albeit in a slightly subdued manner.",

      "question": "Is the paper-like grain texture applied uniformly across the image without causing noticeable loss of detail or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paper-like grain texture seen in Image B involves a subtle effect that closely mimics the appearance of a printed photo. Analyzing this, the texture seems consistent across the entirety of the image, without any prominent spots that show excess grain or unnatural modifications that distort details. The skateboarder and background retain a smooth and seamless texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical relationships between the skateboarder, the skateboard, and the background elements remain consistent and logical after applying the Polaroid effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Polaroid effect primarily adds a stylistic border and text. In Image B, the skateboarder, skateboard, and background components maintain their physical proportions and positions relative to one another. There is no evidence of distortion or resizing that would affect their spatial relationships, meaning consistency is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edges of the skateboarder and the skateboard smooth and free from any unnatural artifacts or distortions resulting from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the skateboarder and skateboard edges appear clean and well-defined, without jagged artifacts or distortions introduced by editing. The faded effect has softened the overall image but not resulted in any evident edge issues around the primary subjects.",
