    "Question": "Q1: Does the person appear naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the person is added next to the zebra. Visually, the lighting on the person is consistent with the lighting in the scene, and there are no apparent artifacts around the person's outline such as unnatural shadows or mismatched colors, which would indicate poor integration. The textures and proportions of the individual align well with the background environment. However, slight inconsistencies may be detected upon close inspection, but they are not overly distracting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the zebra's head turned in a way that looks natural and plausible for a startled reaction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is looking down at the water, and its posture is calm and unaltered from Image A. The position of the zebraâ€™s head is consistent across both images, suggesting no change or startled reaction. The natural line of sight is directed toward the water, with no visible signs of being startled or in an unusual posture.",
    "answer": "no"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the zebra's stripes clear and detailed without any unnatural blurring or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are examined for clarity and definition. They appear sharp, with strong contrast between the black and white areas, maintaining the same fidelity as in Image A. The lines are smooth, and there are no apparent signs of blurring or distortion indicating high-quality image editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the person's foot look like it is realistically pressing down on the zebra's tail without breaking geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the person's foot is positioned above the zebra's tail but does not appear to be pressing down on it. The zebra's tail is resting naturally and shows no visible deformation or change caused by the proximity of the person's foot. The geometrical integrity of the tail is maintained, suggesting the foot is not interacting with it in a meaningful way.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the addition of the person maintain the overall composition and layout of the scene without disrupting the natural setting?",
    "explanation": "The addition of the person in Image B does not overly disrupt the natural setting or the overall composition of the scene. The person is positioned in a way that complements the scene, standing beside the zebra without blocking major elements or causing imbalance. The environmental continuity remains consistent with the original setup, thereby maintaining a coherent layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
