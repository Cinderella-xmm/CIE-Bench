    "Question": "Q1: Do the enlarged and shiny mango pieces retain their natural texture and shape without appearing distorted or unnatural?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces are significantly enlarged and have a shiny effect that gives them a smooth, plasticky appearance similar to cartoon or artificial fruit props. This differs from the natural variations and textures expected from real mango pieces. The alterations in texture and appearance make them appear unnatural compared to real fruit and go beyond merely enhancing visual appeal.",

These features are consistent with illustrations or computer-generated images rather than natural objects.

While the increased polish may enhance cartoon style appeal, it notably alters the natural fruit texture, creating an artificial look lacking detailed surface finishes typical in depictions of real fruit.",
