      "question": "Are the trainâ€™s locomotive and carriages transformed into interlocking geometric blocks that maintain their original proportions and alignment along the track without visible distortions or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's locomotive and carriages appear to be composed of smooth, geometric shapes that fit together in a coherent fashion. These elements seem to be well aligned along the tracks, maintaining proper proportions without any visible distortions or misalignments. The perspective is maintained, suggesting an intentional design to mimic a block or toy-like aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke above the train rendered as smooth, continuous swirling white forms that follow the natural trajectory of rising steam without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B is depicted as a smooth, continuous white form, flowing in a natural trajectory that mirrors the rise of steam. There are no abrupt changes or artifacts that could suggest jagged edges or disruptions in texture, providing a seamless depiction of smoke.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures at the station platform replaced by small, flat puzzle-shaped elements wearing vintage clothing, with no visible distortions in limbs or posture, and do they retain recognizable positions relative to benches and luggage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human figures in Image B are transformed into flat, puzzle-shaped elements that emulate the style of vintage-dressed individuals. These figures display no visible distortions in terms of limb or posture, and their positioning remains consistent with the surrounding elements such as benches and luggage. The transformation aligns with the geometric and puzzle theme of the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fields and hills in the background rendered as clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., rectangles, triangles) that form a cohesive, interlocking design without gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hills and fields appear as geometric shapes that connect to form a cohesive landscape pattern. These shapes are interlocking and do not display any gaps or overlapping errors. The textures transition smoothly without abrupt changes, supporting a deliberate geometric design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape, placed on a light wooden tabletop with visible wood grain and consistent lighting, and are there no floating elements or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the scene as laid out on a light wooden tabletop. The grain of the wood is visible, and the lighting appears consistent with the placement of the scene elements. There are no elements that appear to be floating or have shadows that do not align with their positions, reinforcing the notion of a mounted display on the surface.",
