      "question": "Does the entire cathedral structure appear uniformly rendered in warm stained wood with consistent grain patterns and realistic wood textures across all surfaces, including spires, arches, and tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral model appears to be crafted from a material resembling wood, characterized by a consistent color that suggests a warm stain. The visual cues indicate uniformity in color and texture across various architectural elements such as the spires, arches, and tracery. However, the model lacks detailed wood grain patterns and realistic textures that would typically be associated with a natural wood finish, such as varied grain lines or knots that give wood a lifelike appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the edges of the shadow box clearly defined, structurally coherent, and proportionally sized relative to the cathedral model, with no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral model contained within a shadow box that appears to be well-crafted. The edges of the box are clearly defined and appear to be straight and free from any gaps or misalignments relative to the model housed within. The architectural proportions of the shadow box are consistent with the size of the cathedral model, conveying structural coherence and ensuring that no components appear to be floating or displaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiny pews and chandeliers positioned correctly within the interior of the cathedral model, maintaining proper scale and alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults, and do they cast consistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the interior elements such as pews and chandeliers in the cathedral model. The pews are miniature and aligned symmetrically on the steps, maintaining proportionality with the large architectural features like the arches and doorways. However, there is no indication or visual evidence of chandeliers present, nor a clear view of shadows being cast by these elements due to the perspective and lighting in the image, making it difficult to assess their alignment with vaults or consistency of shadows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the clock mechanism located at the back of the model, featuring visible gears and a moving path for small figures, with no distorted shapes, inconsistent materials, or implausible motion trajectories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock is prominently located at the front of the model instead of the back and is integrated into the fa√ßade of the cathedral model, obscuring any internal clock mechanism or gears from being visible. There are no signs of gears, a moving path, or small figures associated with the clock visible in this image. Hence, it lacks any visible components or moving parts that are often associated with a clock mechanism.",

      "question": "Do the intricate gothic carvings, including the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements, retain sharp detail and accurate geometry in the miniature model without visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature cathedral model in Image B showcases intricate gothic features such as a prominent rose window and other architectural details like flying buttresses. These elements exhibit sharp detail and maintain their distinct gothic design, with no evident blurring, pixelation, or deformation. The architecture is well-preserved, demonstrating accuracy in their miniature form and maintaining the intended design intricacies.",
