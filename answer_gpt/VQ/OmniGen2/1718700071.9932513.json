      "question": "Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curls in the hair are depicted in a marble texture, characteristic of sculptures, which suits the context of a carved artwork. The curls are rendered with consistent shading and variations in depth that reflect the light in a coherent manner, typical of high-quality marble work. There are no visible artifacts like blurring or flattening that would indicate inconsistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental carvings are aligned with the musculature of the statue, particularly around the neck and shoulders. They follow the contours naturally, without gaps or misalignments, and exhibit consistent and coherent shapes, indicating a well-planned design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The angelic figures in the background of Image B are sculpted with clear outlines and maintain correct proportions appropriate for a relief carving. They exhibit a consistent depth that integrates well with the central figure without signs of distortion or fragmentation, adding to the overall harmony of the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entirety of the image is rendered in a monochrome palette that imitates the appearance of a marble sculpture. The shading transitions smoothly from light to dark areas without abrupt changes. This suggests a complete and meticulous color conversion suitable for representing a sculpture-like appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the statue, as depicted, especially based on traditional sculptural norms, would be expected to have five fingers each if visible. However, the visible hand does not clearly show all fingers due to the angle and placement within the image. There are no visible indications of fused digits or unnatural anatomical structures based on what is typically visible.",
