      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables maintain their structural coherence and visual credibility after being transformed into a Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables have been transformed into a stylized representation where each piece is depicted in exaggerated geometric shapes, consistent with Cubist art. This transformation focuses more on artistic expression rather than strict adherence to real-world appearance. The pieces still hold a cohesive structure that suggests they are diced vegetables, such as the cube-like forms for carrots and onions, showing a level of coherence but with an artistic twist.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the diced carrots, celery, and onions natural and detailed, without any obvious loss of detail in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a Cubist style where realism is not a priority, and textures are represented by bold, flat colors without natural detailing. Common textures expected in diced vegetables, such as the fibrous surface of celery and the shiny surface of onions, are replaced by smooth, uniform colors. This style inherently results in a loss of detailed texture.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the diced carrots, celery, and onions appear authentic and harmonious, contributing to the overall natural appearance in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are bold and vivid, typical of a Cubist representation. While they don't match natural colors perfectly, the hues are reminiscent of their real-life counterparts (orange for carrots, green for celery, white for onions). The harmonious palette fits the Cubist style, creating an aesthetically pleasing composition, though it doesn't strive for natural authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables intact and undistorted, without any broken edges or unnatural deformations in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a defining characteristic of the Cubist style is the intentional use of exaggerated, abstract geometric shapes. The shapes are intact within the context of the style but are intentionally distorted for artistic effect, leading to edges that may appear unnatural compared to real diced vegetables. This abstraction is a feature of the style.",

      "question": "Does the knife retain its natural appearance and structural integrity, without any obvious artifacts or distortions in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is stylized according to the Cubist approach but still retains its familiar shape and form. The knife blade and handle are simplified but remain identifiable and coherent as a knife, without erratic distortions or artifacts. The color may be slightly off from what a natural knife might show, but structurally, it keeps its integrity.",
