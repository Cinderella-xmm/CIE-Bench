    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted using a cartoon-like illustration style characterized by bold, continuous lines that uniformly define the edges of its body. This style clearly follows the silhouette of the cat with uniformity and without any distortions or gaps, typical of vector artwork. The visual cue, combined with knowledge of cartoon drawing techniques, supports this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
    "explanation": "The sunglasses in Image B display a uniformly flat orange color without any reflections or gradients, typical of simplified, non-photorealistic illustration techniques. This aligns with the cartoon style, where textures are minimized to achieve a flat appearance, yet maintaining the original shape and position as seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beach background is rendered using solid color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, devoid of blended colors, textures, or gradients. This approach is visualized in cartoon art styles where flat colors are used to represent different parts of a scene, providing a clearer separation between elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
    "explanation": "The harness in Image B appears stylized without any realistic fabric texture, but rather simplified with no detailed illustration of materials. Shadows below the cat are not depicted with gradient colors but rather simple shadow representation without elaborate gradient shading, typical for vector-based artwork.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the major elements such as the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background predominantly feature shades of red, blue, and yellow, which are common in vibrant cartoon styles. This awareness of color theory in cartoons confirms the use of these primary colors homogenously without the presence of other colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
