      "question": "Do the exaggerated muscles on the athleteâ€™s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an exaggerated, comic-book style with highly defined and enlarged muscles, typical of artistic illustrations rather than realistic portrayals. The muscles do not follow natural anatomical contours; they are likely represented with exaggerated size and shapes, introducing unnatural bulges and shapes. This is a stylistic choice common in certain illustrations but does not portray natural human anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fiery red gloves with gold accents visually consistent in material texture and color, with no visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gloves in Image B are cartoonishly exaggerated with smooth, shiny surfaces depicting highlights consistent with a comic book or animated style. The colors, being bold and uniform, do not exhibit signs of pixelation or inconsistencies. The highlights appear more artistic rather than natural reflections, yet they maintain consistency within the chosen style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the strobe lights in the background evenly distributed and consistent in direction and intensity, without creating unnatural shadows or light leaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the background with vibrant strobe lights, typical of dynamic and colorful animated illustrations. These lights are displayed with strong, vivid colors, creating dramatic effects. As this is a stylistic choice, the design does not necessarily need to adhere to strict realism, but they appear consistent in intensity and direction within this illustrative context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank motivational quote panel aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it have consistent lighting and shadowing to appear as if part of the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motivational quote panel, while it shares the same illustrative style, seems somewhat misplaced in alignment with the perspective of the scene. It does not naturally integrate with the rest of the environment in terms of perspective or lighting, appearing superimposed rather than inherently part of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition balanced and framed appropriately so that the central figure and key elements (gloves, stance, lighting) remain clear and undistorted when scaled for print?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with a vibrant, bold style intended for artistic illustration, ensuring clarity and emphasis on the central figure and key elements like the gloves and stance. The composition appears balanced within this stylistic context, maintaining the readability and impact of elements when scaled, typical of designs meant for visual impact rather than intricate detail.",
