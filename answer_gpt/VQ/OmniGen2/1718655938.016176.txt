    "Question": "Q1: Are the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls clearly defined and geometrically consistent, without broken or warped edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls are depicted with smooth, clear, and straight lines with no signs of distortion or irregularities. The shapes are geometrically consistent, demonstrating clean edges and precise angles, common in vector art or digitally created images. This consistency suggests an intentional design rather than photographic imperfection.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the stained-glass windows display clear, coherent patterns with smooth color transitions and no pixelation or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass windows show a cartoon or stylized art style with bold outlines and solid colors. The patterns within the windows are simplified and lack intricate details, yet they are coherent and the transitions between colors are smooth. There are no pixelation or jagged edges visible, indicating a clean digital image rendition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the candy-like tree replacements composed of smooth, continuous shapes with consistent surface textures, and do they maintain plausible proportions relative to the church?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are part of a vibrant, stylized composition with smooth outlines and consistent coloring, resembling a cartoonish or illustrative art style rather than candy-like objects. The proportions of the trees relative to the church maintain a plausible scale, aligning with typical dimensions expected in such artistic depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the patchwork quilt sky feature uniform stitching lines and consistent color blending between patches, with no visible seams or sharp discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is stylized with circular patterns, but it doesnâ€™t resemble a patchwork quilt with stitching lines. The colors blend into each other smoothly without visible seams or sharp discontinuities. The design is uniform and cohesive, maintaining the artistic integrity of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the light sources from the church windows cast consistent, soft shadows on the surrounding grass and path, matching the direction and intensity of the internal glow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the direction of light emitted from the church windows is not clearly depicted as casting shadows on the surrounding environment. The image employs a stylized illustration style where lighting effects are conveyed through color contrasts rather than realistic shadows. Therefore, the depiction of shadows is minimal and not matching the realistic outcome of light glow intensity affecting the grass or path.",
    "answer": "No"
