      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the jacket feature very sharp and clean edges characteristic of a paper-cut style. The metallic foil highlights on the patterns are consistent and uniform, showing no signs of smudging or bleeding into other colors. Such precision suggests a well-crafted, high-quality design true to paper-cut aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow is part of a digital or illustrative design depicting traditional Korean attire. The bow's illustration shows symmetry and the absence of prominent creasing or distortion. However, given that the bow is now a digital element, the fabric folds appear designed to preserve aesthetic smoothness and symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architecture is illustrated in a stylized format with elements like proper roof alignment and perspective consistent with classic Korean architectural designs. The illustration avoids skewed angles, floating elements, or inconsistencies that would detract from the representation of traditional architecture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed leather-bound panel uniformly textured across its surface, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped elements meet the background, and does it provide a consistent depth impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embossed leather-bound panel shows a consistent textured surface distributed evenly, without visible seams or irregularities. The stamped elements neatly integrate with the background, demonstrating a consistent depth impression that maintains a high-quality finish expected from such a design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand depicted seems to be an illustration along with the rest of the elements. However, despite the illustrative style, it maintains the proper joint curvature and skin texture. The chain follows a continuous path, avoiding intersections and appearing seamlessly part of the overall piece, maintaining continuity and aesthetic appeal.",
