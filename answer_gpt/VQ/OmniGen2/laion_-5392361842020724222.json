      "question": "Does the gilded brocade texture on the kneeling figure's robe show consistent metallic sheen and intricate pattern details without unnatural highlights or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gilded brocade texture on the kneeling figure's robe exhibits a consistent metallic sheen that reflects light naturally, simulating the appearance of real brocade fabric. The intricate pattern details are visible and do not show signs of repetition, which would make them look unnatural. The sheen and patterns move fluidly with the fabric folds, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or anomalies in texture.",
