      "question": "Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterned textile on the character's top in Image B features a variety of geometric shapes with a consistent color scheme, particularly red, blue, and yellow. The pattern is complex and appears to be inspired by traditional African prints, with a natural-looking fabric texture. The visual cues suggest that the textile pattern is crafted coherently, with no visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts that indicate a seamless integration into the image. These characteristics reflect a high-quality portrayal of fabric in a digital illustration.",

      "question": "Are the tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces clearly defined, proportionally accurate, and free from distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold earrings and necklaces worn by the character in Image B show clear and well-defined shapes. The craftsmanship appears intricate, reflecting the cultural significance often seen in tribal jewelry designs. The reflection and shine on the metallic surfaces are rendered realistically, maintaining proportion and avoiding any visible distortions. The illustration successfully represents these elements with artistic precision.",

      "question": "Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstracted umbrellas are depicted in the background with a colorful array of red, green, blue, and yellow canopies. They maintain reasonable proportions relative to the market stalls they are associated with. The positioning and alignment of the umbrellas suggest a typical market scene, which accurately reflects spatial relationships consistent with this environment, without any incorrect overlapping or unrealistic floating positions.",

      "question": "Are the musical notes distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories around the character’s head, without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs in their paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The musical notes in Image B are artistically distributed around the character’s head, suggesting motion and sound. They are placed in smooth trajectories that appear to emanate from the scene, with no abrupt cut-offs or glaring breaks that disrupt the flow. This even distribution contributes to the thematic expression of music and motion within the artwork.",

      "question": "Does the character’s right hand show five fingers with correct proportions, natural curvature, and realistic skin texture, without any missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's right hand, which is positioned elegantly near her face, displays five fingers that are proportionally correct and naturally curved. Each digit is distinct and correctly formed, with a realistic appearance of skin texture and no evidence of duplication or distortion. The hand is an integral part of the image, displaying artistic skill in its depiction.",
