      "question": "Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's face in Image B has been intentionally blurred, so a direct analysis of its integration into the vinyl material is not possible. However, reviewing the unblurred features of the body and suit provides insight into the consistent integration of textures. Given that other elements like hair and costume visually align with the vinyl aesthetic while retaining realistic details, it can be inferred that the face might also be similarly integrated if visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body proportions and posture are typical of a stylized soft vinyl figureâ€”slightly exaggerated but still within the bounds of what is visually credible for such figures. The stance is stable, and the adjustments in proportions are common in such collectible designs, ensuring visual coherence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B maintains a detailed texture and visual realism with a clear depiction of different materials like leather and fabric. Typical of soft vinyl figures, the design elements are well-preserved without distortions, indicating a successful translation from realistic to vinyl format.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The accessories, including the weapon, are proportionally accurate and fit naturally with the character, adhering to the typical style of soft vinyl figures.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted standing on a black base, which appears stable and proportional to the figure. The figure's posture and balance on the base are natural and consistent with other figures of the soft vinyl variety, avoiding any visible distortion or support artifacts.",
