    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the monocled eye on the front face of the clock seamlessly integrated into the original frame, with no visible seam or texture discontinuity around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocled eye appears integrated into the clock's frame without any visible seams or texture discontinuities around its perimeter. The smooth continuity of the material aligns with the surrounding structure, suggesting a harmonious integration. Common design principles for seamless integration would involve meticulous craftsmanship to ensure no texture or color discrepancies, which appears to be achieved here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gear-like limbs extend from the side panels of the clock with continuous material flow and geometric alignment, showing no signs of floating or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases gear-like limbs extending from the side panels of the clock that exhibit a continuous material flow and geometric alignment with the body of the clock. There are no visible signs of floating or disconnected joints, as the limbs appear securely attached and integrated into the clock’s structure, maintaining the visual consistency expected from mechanical appendages.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pendulum converted into a tail that extends downward from the bottom center of the clock, maintaining a smooth curvature and consistent material texture with the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock retains its pendulum rather than converting it into a tail extending downward. The structure depicted does not show a transformation into a tail but maintains the original pendulum design. Therefore, the condition of a smooth curvature and consistent texture of a tail is not applicable here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper tones applied uniformly across the clock’s surface, matching the lighting direction and showing realistic reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a uniform application of brass and copper tones across the clock, giving the surface a cohesive appearance. The lighting is consistent, enhancing realistic reflections and shadows, which adhere to typical principles of material rendering to simulate realistic metal surfaces. This permits the reflection of light consistent with the direction and intensity depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the steam valves placed at each corner of the clock’s upper section, protruding outward with clean edges and no overlap or deformation of the surrounding structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam valves in Image B are situated on the lateral sides rather than directly at the corners of the clock's upper section. They protrude outward with clean edges that do not intrude or cause visible deformation to the surrounding structure. While they meet the criteria for clean protrusion, their placement does not entirely match the corners of the upper section as specified.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns along the clock’s base and sides clear, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the original ornamental design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved patterns along the clock’s base and sides are clear and evenly spaced, adding to the ornamental appeal. They maintain stylistic consistency with intricate design elements typical of ornate craftsmanship. This observation aligns with common practices in maintaining continuity with original design aesthetics, ensuring the decorative elements do not clash or appear out of place.",
