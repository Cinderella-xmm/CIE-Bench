    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the color transitions in the sky, sea, and buildings smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color transitions were adjusted to create a brighter and flatter aesthetic more typical of digital art. While this image effectively uses gradient for visual interest, upon close inspection, some edges may appear more intentionally digital due to added features and text. The artistic style suggests an intention for smooth transitions, but naturally occurring color patches can break this on some digital renderings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic cat character positioned on a rooftop with correct scale relative to nearby buildings, and does it have a natural pose without deformed limbs or distorted anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an anthropomorphic cat character on the rooftop, prominently sized, and positioned such that it doesn't disrupt architectural proportions in context. While exhibiting a cartoon style, its anatomy remains consistent without evidence of deformed or exaggerated limbs. Its design aligns with typical cartoon characters rather than realistic measurements relative to the surrounding scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text 'Pepper the Cat's Neapolitan Adventure: Searching for the Legendary Vesuvian Treasure' fully visible, positioned within the margin area, and not overlapping with key architectural features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headline 'Pepper the Cat's Neapolitan Adventure: Searching for the Legendary Vesuvian Treasure' appears prominently across the top edge, framing the sky. This placement avoids architecture elements, ensuring it stands out without overshadowing key visual anchors, such as the central building.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative borders along all four edges of the image continuous, symmetrical, and free of gaps or misaligned tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces decorative borders using geometric design, evenly distributed along all edges. Upon review, these geometric patterns are well integrated without observable gaps or discrepancies in alignment, enhancing visual framing of the artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the added cat character and border elements align with the light source direction seen in the sky and buildings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the cat character, which maintains a simple shaded aesthetic consistent with the cartoon style, while sky and building lighting suggests directional light, creating shadows primarily downward. This change and the absence of complex shadows imply an intentional mismatch for stylistic effect rather than literal interpretation.",
