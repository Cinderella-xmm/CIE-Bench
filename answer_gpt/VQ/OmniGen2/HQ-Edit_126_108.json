      "question": "Do the cascading arms and legs of the water elemental follow natural water flow patterns without abrupt breaks or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water elemental is depicted with flowing, fluid-like features extending from the figure's body. These patterns are designed to resemble the natural motion and curvature of water, showing smooth transitions with graceful looping curves, consistent with how water naturally moves and cascades. There are no abrupt breaks or unnatural bending observed, indicating that the design follows natural water flow patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the crystalline textures on the cliff faces varied in shape and size, and do they appear embedded within the rock rather than overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystals are depicted as varied in shape and size, with a number of distinct points and faces. They appear to be emerging from the rock surface, giving the impression of being naturally embedded rather than just placed on top of the rock. This visual detail reflects common characteristics of natural crystal formations whereby crystals grow from the mineral content of rocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the glowing azure pattern emit a soft, diffused light that interacts with the surrounding rock and water without harsh edges or over-bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing azure patterns are depicted as emitting light with a gentle, diffused quality. This results in a smooth interaction with the surrounding rocks and water, creating a harmonious balance in the lighting without harsh edges or overly bright spots, which would disrupt the serene atmosphere of the scene. This reflects common artistic practices of rendering magical or mystical elements with soft light to integrate them into the environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mist and leaf crown transition smoothly from the solid canopy and appear anchored to the landscape with consistent depth and motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mist and leaf elements are designed to transition naturally from the landscape features, such as the cliffs and surrounding foliage, suggesting a connection and integration with the solid structures in the scene. The consistent depth and motion imply that they are part of the natural environment, depicting a harmonious and anchored quality that maintains the visual illusion of a seamless integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the whirlpool eyes properly sized, located in a logical position within the waterfall, and do they show realistic spiral motion and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visual elements resembling whirlpool eyes within the waterfall area. The design does not contain any specific features that might interrupt the natural flow or visual coherence of the waterfall scene.",
