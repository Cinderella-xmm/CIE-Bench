      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox mask is designed with stylized and symmetrical features, typical of geometric and illustrative art. The eyes, nose, and mouth are aligned symmetrically along a central vertical axis and maintain proportional sizes relative to each other, which is visually common in such artworks to emphasize balance and aesthetics. These elements show no signs of distortion or irregular stretches.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono replaced with clean, geometric motifs that follow consistent lines and shapes, without blurred or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the kimono decorated with geometric motifs instead of floral patterns. These motifs are characterized by clear, sharp lines and consistent shapes, indicative of vector-based or graphically-designed elements. There is a noticeable absence of blurred or fragmented edges, giving the kimono a polished and intentional design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors on the kimono and mask transition smoothly between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones without visible color bleeding or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color transitions on the kimono and mask exhibit smooth gradations between deep reds and pale pinks, suggesting careful digital rendering. The lack of visible color bleeding or inconsistent shading is indicative of high-quality graphic design, where color palettes are managed through controlled gradients rather than physical paint, ensuring uniformity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono appears illustrated in a stylized 2D fashion, which means it lacks the physical characteristics of natural draping or fabric folds typically found in real garments. The design is flat and stylized, but since the image is intended to be a 2D graphic, the flatness does not necessarily disrupt the intended visual presentation. However, in terms of 'natural' drape relating to realism, this does not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the fox mask and kimono free from jagged edges, pixelation, or texture seams that suggest incomplete rendering or editing errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a clean digital vector design approach, where the lines and surfaces of the fox mask and kimono are consistently smooth and devoid of jagged edges or pixelation. The absence of texture seams or incomplete rendering indicates a well-executed graphic design, typically achieved in vector illustration, where images are not pixel-dependent, ensuring an error-free appearance.",
