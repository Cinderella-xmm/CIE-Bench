      "question": "Are the textures of the ceramic mosaic tiles smooth and consistent without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic mosaic tiles are designed to have a textured, craft-like appearance with different colors and geometric patterns. This texture resembles handcrafted ceramic work often intentionally featuring variations. The tiles appear smooth relative to their intended design, without unnatural artifacts such as pixelation or misplaced elements. The smoothness is consistent with typical expectations for ceramic tile designs, where slight irregularities contribute to the aesthetic appeal.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the map and pins maintain their integrity without distortion in the ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic art does not represent an actual map but uses geometric shapes and pin designs inspired by a real map. The pins are integrated into the mosaic design with shapes that suggest their function. However, compared to standard pin shapes seen in mapping contexts, they have some artistic changes to fit the mosaic style. This stylistic representation slightly distorts the shapes and map layout but does so intentionally, common in art to fit the medium's aesthetics rather than function.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the ceramic mosaic tiles bold and harmonious, reflecting the original map's visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases bold and vivid colors in the mosaic tiles, such as greens, blues, yellows, and reds. These colors are used in harmony to create an aesthetically pleasing design. While vibrant, they do not necessarily reflect the color scheme typical of maps, which usually include more subdued and varied shades to denote terrain or geopolitical boundaries. The artistic choice in Image B enhances color brightness for artistic impact rather than geographic plausibility.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the map and pins been preserved in the ceramic mosaic tile artwork without significant loss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A shows that the fine details observed in the original map, such as roads, rivers, and text labels, are absent in the mosaic artwork in Image B. The design focuses more on artistic abstraction with minimal specific map details. As a result, the precise representation of actual map features is lost, replaced with a rendition focused on color and shape as artistic elements.",

      "question": "Does the hand appear natural and undistorted while interacting with the ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand interacting with the ceramic mosaic appears proportionate and holds the pins in a natural manner. The skin tone and positioning of fingers seem realistic, and the knitwear sleeve fits appropriately, replicating a natural interaction with an object. There are no visible distortions, which are sometimes present in edited images, making the hand look artificial or awkward.",
