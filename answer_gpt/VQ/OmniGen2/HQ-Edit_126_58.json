      "question": "Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan's wings are depicted with a frosted glass effect, seamlessly illuminated with a consistent translucency. The wings show an integrated pattern without visible seams or surface distortions, maintaining a coherent, glowing appearance. Using common knowledge, frosted glass typically diffuses light evenly, and the wings' texture shows this even diffusion well.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the neck of the swan functions as a smooth, tapered stopper, maintaining a proportional alignment with the rest of its body. It does not showcase any unnatural bending or jagged surfaces. The tapering is cohesive with the general design of such bottles, reflecting a consistent shape without inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative elements appear well-integrated into the base of the bottle without any signs of floating or disconnection. The colors of red, pink, and green are vivid and maintain a natural appearance without noticeable blurring or pixelation, reflecting a consistent quality that suggests proper integration into the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"Winter Glow\" text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays 'Winter Glow' text that is clearly visible and appears aligned with the curve of the bottle. The iridescent effect on the text is smooth, with an even gradient, avoiding any unnatural color fringes or digital distortions. Typically, this requires accurate digital rendering to ensure the effect matches the bottle's contour.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the swan-bottle transformed with structural coherence. The different parts of the bottle are proportionally aligned, maintaining fluidity in the shape with no visible warping or stretching. The cohesive form reflects a carefully crafted design where each section matches the overall aesthetic.",
