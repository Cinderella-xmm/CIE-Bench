      "question": "Do the ceramic sculptures exhibit a uniform glossy finish with realistic reflections that align with the direction and intensity of the sunset light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the ceramic sculptures shows a clear, glossy surface finish that reflects light consistently across different parts of the sculptures. The reflections and highlights on the surfaces indicate a smooth and possibly polished finish. However, there is no indication of real-world lighting conditions such as sunset reflected on the sculptures. The uniform lighting appears artificial and studio-like rather than matching sunset light dynamics.",

      "question": "Are the textured scales evenly distributed across the sculpture surfaces without visible repetition, distortion, or sharp edges suggesting digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures have textured scales that appear even and uniformly distributed. The surface texture is smooth and consistent, with no evident signs of repetitive patterns or digital artifacting, such as distortion or sharp edges, which typically occur due to inadequate digital processing or rendering errors.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep oceanic blue coloration of the sculptures consistent across all parts and harmonious with the surrounding ocean and sky colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures have a uniform deep oceanic blue coloration that is consistent throughout their surfaces. However, the background does not feature an ocean or sky, but a plain sandy color, making it hard to compare or harmonize the sculpturesâ€™ color with ocean and sky colors. Therefore, it is not harmonious as there is no surrounding ocean or sky for color comparison.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly sandy-colored with no visible traces of the original ocean, waves, or shoreline elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image is consistently sandy-colored and does not show any elements related to the ocean, waves, or shoreline. It presents a uniform backdrop that does not contain traces of aquatic or coastal features, suggesting a studio-like setting free from the original scene's characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a continuous, flowing wave pattern that matches the curvature and rhythm of the original ocean waves in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures are placed in a static arrangement that does not appear to mimic any specific flowing wave pattern. The arrangement is more geometric and orderly, unlike the dynamic, natural curvatures and rhythms typical of ocean waves. Therefore, they do not match any curvature or rhythm associated with the ocean waves seen in the original image.",
