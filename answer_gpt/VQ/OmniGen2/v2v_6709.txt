    "Question": "Q1: Does the perfume bottle appear to be constructed from Lego bricks without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle exhibits a smooth, polished glass texture, typical of high-quality perfume bottles, without any of the characteristic textures or fragmentation associated with Lego bricks. The facets of the bottle show clarity and reflection, which are attributes of glass and not Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the fabric background transformed into Lego bricks maintain a natural appearance without any obvious distortions or unnatural shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not display fabric background; instead, it features a solid orange surface lacking any textures or patterns that would be present in fabric made of Lego bricks. The flatness and consistent color indicate that this area is not transformed into Lego bricks.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions and physical rationality of the perfume bottle and the fabric background preserved, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The proportions of the perfume bottle in Image B are consistent with the typical perfume bottle shape, maintaining symmetry and proper geometry. There is no fabric background in Image B, only a solid color backdrop. Therefore, there's nothing distorted to point to related to fabric.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, with the perfume bottle and fabric background made of Lego bricks, retain visual credibility and coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the layout exhibits visual coherence with a realistic perfume bottle set against a plain backdrop, without transformation into Lego bricks. The visual elements maintain credibility due to their realistic presentation rather than any Lego transformation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the fine details of the perfume bottle and the fabric background accurately represented in the Lego brick form without any loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a detailed and clear view of the perfume bottle, with crystal-clear reflections and facets typical of glass, not Lego. There is no representation of fabric or Lego brick texture in Image B, so no detail loss occurs from Lego transformation.",
    "answer": "No"
