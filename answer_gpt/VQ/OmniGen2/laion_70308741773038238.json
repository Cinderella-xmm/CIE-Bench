      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the elongated body retain smooth, continuous curvature along the side and rear panels without sharp edges or unnatural bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the elongated body of the vehicle resembles a sleek, streamlined design typical of modern boats or high-end vehicles. There are no visible sharp edges; the transitions between panels appear smooth and continuous, indicating a well-constructed and thoughtfully designed form. This smoothness is characteristic of aerodynamic designs, which aim to reduce drag and enhance fluid dynamics. Common sense in design suggests that such smoothness is intentional to convey a sense of luxury and efficiency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glass bases at the wheel positions transparent with visible internal texture, evenly shaped, and grounded flush with the platform without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bases at the wheel positions appear to be transparent, showcasing a visible pattern or texture within. They seem to be evenly shaped, resembling a crystalline structure, and are positioned in a way that suggests they are meant to be flush with the platform. There are no noticeable floating or clipping issues; the bases are seamlessly integrated, indicating attention to detail in the design. The use of such bases instead of traditional wheels can signify a conceptual or high-end showpiece model, possibly for display rather than practical use.",

      "question": "Is the silver cap centered on the roof area, with clean edges and reflective surface that matches the surrounding chrome elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver cap on the roof area is visible, and it appears to be centrally positioned. The edges of the cap are clean and crisp, providing a distinct boundary in line with precise manufacturing standards. The reflective surface of the cap harmonizes with the other chrome elements on the vehicle, suggesting consistency in the material choices and design language. Such harmony is significant in maintaining the aesthetic appeal and perceived value of high-end vehicles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed text along the side panel clearly legible, aligned with the body's curvature, and rendered with subtle depth and shadow to match the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the embossed text on the side panel can be noted for its clarity and legibility. The text follows the curvature of the vehicle's body, ensuring that it remains readable despite the contoured surfaces. The rendering of the text includes subtle depth and shadow, which enhances its contrast against the body and suggests a material consistency with the rest of the design. This attention to detail in texturing and alignment supports the vehicle's overall premium feel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns flow continuously across the surface without repeating tiles, jagged edges, or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns adorn the vehicle's body, providing a sense of motion and fluidity. The patterns flow without interruption, ensuring there are no noticeable repeating tiles or visual discrepancies like jagged edges. The light interplay on the waves appears consistent, without mismatches, and supports the cohesive aesthetic of the design. Such continuity in pattern and lighting is essential to maintain a polished and professional appearance, important in high-end conceptual designs.",
