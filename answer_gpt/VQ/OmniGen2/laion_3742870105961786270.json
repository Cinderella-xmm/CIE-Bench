      "question": "Does the converted jug appear as a translucent glass stopper with visible reflections and refractions, and is it properly aligned with the bottle’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle features a decorative stopper that appears opaque with gold accents atop the bottle. It does not have the characteristics of a translucent glass stopper with visible reflections or refractions. The stopper seems to align with the bottle's neck, but it lacks the translucent quality described in the question.",

      "question": "Is the robe seamlessly transformed into a bottle shape with smooth contours, natural lighting gradients, and no visible tears or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe from Image A has been transformed into a bottle shape. The bottle has a smooth, rounded contour that resembles traditional perfume bottles, with lighting gradients that give a realistic appearance. There are no visible tears or geometric distortions present in the design.",

      "question": "Is the goose-shaped charm integrated into the base of the bottle with a visible connection point, and does it maintain proportional size and stylized but recognizable features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a goose-shaped charm located near the base of the bottle. It maintains a proportional size compared to the bottle and has stylized but recognizable features of a goose. However, it does not appear to be physically integrated into the base of the bottle but rather placed near it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grapevine engravings clearly defined, following the bottle’s contour, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent line thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there do not appear to be grapevine engravings present on the bottle. Instead, the design features ornate gold detailing with floral motifs. Since no grapevine engravings are visible, they cannot be evaluated for definition or line consistency.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cardboard packaging in Image B is shown next to the bottle. It has clean edges and includes classical motifs that are clear, with no signs of blurring or misalignment. The packaging appears to be properly designed and proportioned relative to the bottle.",

    {

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, earthy tones and gold accents are used throughout the design of the bottle and packaging. These colors are uniformly applied with material-specific highlights that give them a realistic look. There are no abrupt color shifts, maintaining a cohesive visual theme.",
