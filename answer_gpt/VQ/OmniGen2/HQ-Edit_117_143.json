      "question": "Does the dancer's silhouette retain natural body proportions and smooth contours without distorted limbs or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s silhouette appears to be natural and balanced. The limbs, including the arms and legs, show smooth contours and realistic body proportions, which are typical in illustrations of dancers with graceful poses. The absence of distorted limbs or unusual joint appearances suggests the image is consistent with normal human anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the ruffles of the red dress transformed into flame-like swirls with smooth gradients and consistent lighting, avoiding jagged edges or disjointed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ruffles of the red dress are indeed transformed into flame-like swirls. They exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting effects, which contribute to a fluid appearance. The transformation retains smooth and cohesive shapes without jagged edges, aligning with the typical depiction of flames in art which are smooth and dynamic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the golden crescent moon reflection on the ground aligned with the position of the moon in the sky and does it follow realistic light reflection patterns on the tiled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the crescent moon is visible on the ground. Although it could be debated whether the alignment is precise based on real-world light physics, artistically, the reflection is in a plausible position relative to the crescent moon in the sky, and it follows a visually realistic pattern of light on a surface. It is consistent with artistic portrayals of reflections.",

      "question": "Does the starry night sky border blend seamlessly with the main sky background without visible edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural star clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the starry night sky does blend seamlessly into the main sky background. There are no visible edges or unnatural clustering of stars, and it maintains a consistent aesthetic that seamlessly integrates into the overall night scene, reflecting typical portrayals of starry skies in art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dancer’s raised hand show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no missing or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s raised hand is illustrated with five distinct fingers, each showing natural joint angles and proportions typical of human anatomy. The absence of extra or missing digits further confirms the adherence to realistic hand depiction in the artwork.",
