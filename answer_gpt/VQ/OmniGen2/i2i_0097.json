    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the addition of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” appear naturally integrated without disrupting the overall visual balance of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' are added overlaid on a white plate with a spoon placed on it. The text is centered and aligned with the spoon, making good use of the space while keeping the rest of the design clean and simple. This integration respects the symmetry and simplicity originally present in the setup. Therefore, the visual balance of the plate and spoon is not disrupted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural textures introduced in the image due to the text overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the text overlay appears smooth and seamlessly integrated into the image. The text is bold and clear, with no visible artifacts such as blurring or pixelation around the letters. The textures of the plate and spoon remain consistent and undisturbed by the addition of the text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the text sizes for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” seem proportional and appropriate compared to the scale of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features text that is proportional to the size of the plate and spoon. 'Master Chef' is larger, emphasizing its importance, while 'Final Round' is smaller in size. Their dimensions respect the boundaries of the circular plate, ensuring the plate and spoon still significantly contribute to the image's focus, maintaining balance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the font style chosen for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” complement the simplicity of the white plate and silver spoon, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font style chosen for the text in Image B is bold and straightforward, which complements the simple design of the white plate and silver spoon. It does not introduce unnecessary complexity, thus preserving the clean and minimalist sophistication of the overall visual theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the circular shape of the plate remained intact and undistorted despite the addition of the text elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of text does not alter the circular shape of the plate. The text has been strategically placed to ensure it does not interfere with the contours or the natural geometry of the plate. This maintains the integrity of the original circular design.",
