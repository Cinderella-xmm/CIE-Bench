      "question": "Does the enlarged head appear natural and maintain structural coherence without distortion or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the head in Image B, the size and proportions are exaggerated but consistent with the stylized representation of a bobblehead or cartoon likeness. This is common in art styles that emphasize certain features for effect, and given this context, the head appears structurally coherent without showing signs of distortion or unnatural stretching.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cartoonified body free of obvious artifacts and maintains a certain sense of realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body in Image B has been stylized to fit a cartoonish representation, such as a bobblehead figurine. It is devoid of artifacts or flaws that typically appear in poor editing or rendering processes and maintains a smooth appearance consistent with this art style. Hence, it retains a certain sense of realism within its context.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the bobblehead on the bookshelf look visually plausible and structurally consistent with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the bobblehead positioned in front of what appears to be a bookshelf. The image shows consistency in lighting and alignment that suggests the bobblehead could plausibly be placed on a surface in front of the bookshelf without evident mismatch or structural inconsistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the face retained its accuracy with no loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face in Image B has been blurred, making it difficult to assess the retention of fine details or accuracy. Thus, the question of accuracy and detail retention cannot be effectively answered for this edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the combination of an accurate face and a cartoonified body achieve coherence and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a blurred face and a cartoonified body. Though the face cannot be assessed for accuracy, the stylized body contributes to a coherent appearance typical of a bobblehead or stylized figure, achieving a visually deliberate effect that maintains structural harmony.",
