      "question": "Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the figurine has a uniform glossy finish that is consistent with the qualities of a ceramic material. The gloss appears smooth and uniform, without any signs of knit texture or uneven sheen. The shiny surface and reflection are common attributes of a ceramic material, indicating a successful transition from the previous knit texture seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Is the terracotta color applied uniformly across the entire body of the figurine, without streaks, discoloration, or mismatched tones in different areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a figurine with a terracotta color uniformly applied across its body. The color appears consistent, with no visible streaks, discolorations, or mismatched tones. The surface reflects light evenly, contributing to the cohesive appearance of the terracotta color throughout the entire figurine, unlike Image A, which has a woven texture that affects color uniformity.",

      "question": "Are the floral engravings clearly defined, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly embedded into the surface of the figurine without causing geometric distortions or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral engravings in Image B are clearly defined and proportionally scaled, seamlessly embedded into the surface of the figurine. They do not show any geometric distortions or overlapping inconsistencies, maintaining a balance and enhancing the aesthetic value of the figurine. This detail contrasts with Image A, which lacks such engravings due to its simple knit design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the amber-colored eyes have a smooth, polished appearance with appropriate reflection and depth, and are they correctly positioned within the facial structure without appearing displaced or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the amber-colored eyes of the figurine have a smooth, polished appearance with appropriate reflection and depth. They are correctly positioned within the facial structure, contributing to the figurine's realistic finish and charm. Their integration is coherent, unlike in Image A, where the eyes are button-like, simple, and less polished.",

      "question": "Is the figurine resting flat on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and natural shadowing beneath it, indicating proper physical support and spatial coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine resting flat on a wooden surface with visible wood grain. There is clear natural shadowing beneath the figurine, indicating proper physical support and spatial coherence. This setup ensures the figurine's stability and aligns with common presentation techniques seen in product photography, enhancing realism and depth compared to Image A, where the object is held in a hand.",
