    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis involves examining the visible parts of the angel for skin texture consistency. The surrounding areas show smooth texture and natural coloration, with no signs of artifacts like pixelation or halos, common indicators of poor editing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues suggest the garments are well-integrated, with realistic draping and consistent texture. The fold depth and material appearance align logically with how garments naturally sit on a body due to gravity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the wings appear as subtle, layered highlights that follow the natural curvature of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or breaking feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents follow the wings’ contours smoothly, creating a realistic highlight effect without sharp, unnatural glares. They maintain the integrity of feather edges, suggesting careful editing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the angel’s figure and the new celestial background smooth, with consistent lighting direction and no abrupt edges or mismatched depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background transition is seamless, with consistent lighting that aligns with the illuminated wings and body, showing no abrupt changes or mismatch in depth perception.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, proper shadowing, and skin texture without swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of the hands reveals five fingers aligned naturally, with appropriate shadowing and realistic skin texture, free from any anomalies like extra digits or swelling.",
