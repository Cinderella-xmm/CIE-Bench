      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the crystal wands appear to have smooth surfaces with consistent refraction, indicative of high-quality materials often used in make-up brush handles. There are no visible digital artifacts or irregularities that disrupt the visual integrity of the wands, suggesting that they are rendered correctly without any graphic anomalies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase features etched floral patterns that demonstrate continuity and even distribution. These patterns appear to be well-integrated into the surface of the vase, which is characteristic of expertly crafted glass or crystal decorations without any broken lines or inconsistent shading, indicating precision in design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a carved crystal ribbon with floral motifs. The motifs are fully formed, and the ribbon design is continuous without breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas, suggesting that it was correctly crafted or rendered in 3D without conversion errors from a 2D design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection on the mirrored surface below the crystal vase provides a clear and undistorted view of the vase and its contents. The lighting aligns well between the real and reflected image, maintaining symmetry without distortions, implying accurate light rendering and reflection handling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no visible pearls inside the vase as seen in Image A. Therefore, the question of pearl uniformity and spacing, as well as potential compression artifacts, does not apply to the crystal vase shown in Image B. Hence, considering Image B alone, there are no pearls, and therefore no issues with their rendering.",
