        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style cartoon character is clearly positioned at the center of the image.

      "question": "Are the colors and materials of the chibi character's hard hat, shirt, and vest consistent with the original imageâ€™s description and appear natural in the 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's colors and materials are suitable for this type of character design, using bright and uniform colors. The hard hat is yellow, the shirt is yellow, and the vest is orange. These colors are typical for construction-themed apparel and blend naturally within the clean visual style of the character in the cartoon 3D environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a seamless transition between the chibi-style character and the low-poly construction scene. The character stands alone without direct interaction with the crane model, preserving the minimalist and clean appearance typical of such stylized character designs. The character's smooth surface complements the simple background without artifacts or competing textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background in the edited image a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model, and is it devoid of elements from the original beach scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a simplified environment with a light gray background and a small crane model placed next to the character. This is a departure from Image A, which features a beach scene with a wild horse and distant houses. The background in Image B includes none of the original beach scenery elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is centralized, with the chibi-style character placed prominently in the middle of the frame. This gives the appearance of a balanced and proportionate design. The character is within a nearly square image ratio, which supports a centered composition, preserving uniformity.",
