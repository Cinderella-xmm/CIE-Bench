      "question": "Does the mug maintain its structural integrity and geometric shape after being converted into an oil painting, without appearing distorted or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug preserves its rounded shape and typical structure seen in an everyday coffee mug. Despite the transformation into an oil painting, with its brushstroke textures and color blending, the mug does not appear distorted or broken. The visual representation maintains the core contours and dimensions consistent with a typical coffee mug, making the shape appear intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or obvious artifacts present on the mug or coffee surface after the style conversion to an oil painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being modified into an oil painting, naturally incorporates texture through brushstrokes, characteristic of such an artistic style. These are not considered artifacts but rather intentional features. The surfaces exhibit smooth transitions of hues and textures typical of an oil painting without any elements that seem out of place or distracting beyond artistic expectations.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the mug and its surroundings remain visually credible and consistent with an oil painting style, without looking out of place or overly artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is vibrant, and the application of colors reflects classical oil painting techniques with swirls and contrasts. The shadows cast near the mug and the coaster mimic light behavior one might anticipate in a scene portrayed through oil paints, offering a visually plausible interpretation consistent with the artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials of the mug and the coaster still look natural and appropriate for an oil painting, without showing any signs of unnatural blending or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B translates the mug and coaster into the realm of oil paints effectively, where the blending and texture highlight the style's characteristic fluidity. The transition from solid to painterly does not introduce unnatural inconsistencies in material representation; the mug retains its glossy finish through painterly sheen, which aligns with typical oil painting depictions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the mug handle and its reflections been preserved clearly, without any significant loss of detail or degradation in the oil painting conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mug handle in Image B retains recognizable detail, albeit stylized according to the oil painting's brushstroke aesthetics. The reflections on the mug are stylized but retain their essence to convey light and shadow effectively, typical of artistic interpretation, ensuring no significant loss or degradation of critical details.",
