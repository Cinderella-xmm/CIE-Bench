      "question": "Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold embellishments on the Dashiki appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric. The reflective properties look realistic, with highlights and shadows consistent with a fabric's surface interaction with light. There are no visible artifacts such as floating pieces or pixelated edges, indicating a well-rendered design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the beads and symbols on the Dashiki's shoulders are aligned according to the context of shoulder curvature and anatomy. The material textures are depicted consistently with natural beading and embroidery, showing no signs of distortion or misalignment with the shoulder's position.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Acacia trees in the background exhibit typical characteristics, such as the umbrella-like canopy and branched structure common to these trees. There appear to be no geometric distortions or inconsistencies in their proportions, suggesting a coherent and accurate depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wild grass in Image B shows a range of natural variation in height and orientation, with an apparent non-repetitive pattern that reflects realistic grassy landscapes. The color variations add to the natural quality, avoiding a uniform or tiled appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each, with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shading that matches the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays hands with five fingers each, and the alignment of the joints appears natural. The skin texture and shading are consistent with the rest of the figure, showing attention to realistic depiction without noticeable anatomical errors.",
