    "Question": "Q1: Does the airplane maintain its structural consistency despite being transformed into a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is depicted as a stylized cartoon character with exaggerated features typical of chibi design, such as large eyes and a smiley face, which significantly alters its structural appearance compared to a typical airplane. Common sense suggests that airplane designs are generally streamlined and functional, while this transformation focuses on characterization and aesthetic appeal, deviating from structural consistency.",
