      "question": "Does the handwritten word \"Draft\" on the yellow paper appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Draft' is displayed on the yellow paper. Visually, the text looks well placed with consistent color and texture, matching the surrounding material of the paper without any noticeable discrepancies such as mismatched shadows or color bleeding. This seamless integration is achieved as the text appears to be naturally part of the paper surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and material of the handwritten word \"Draft\" visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Draft' appears to be written in a bold, stylized font that is not typically consistent with what a pencil would produce, especially with a sharp pencil seen in the image. Pencil handwriting typically has texture variations and softer lines, while the text here is uniformly bold and smooth, indicating a possible inconsistency with pencil writing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the addition of the handwritten word \"Draft\" preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the text 'Draft' is aligned properly on the yellow paper. The edges of the text align well with the paper's angles without any visible distortion or misalignment, preserving the structural appearance of the paper itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the handwritten word \"Draft\" sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Draft' on the yellow paper appears in Image B with sharp and clear edges. There is no sign of blurring or pixelation, maintaining a crisp appearance that is typically sought after in digital text enhancement or writing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word \"Draft\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil originally pointed toward the yellow paper in Image A. After adding the text, while the visual composition indicates the pencil could be adding to the word, the text's consistent and bold style suggests it wasn't actually written by the pencil. Hence, the physical logic regarding the pencil's role in writing is diminished.",
