      "question": "Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shopping bags are displayed clearly against the background. They have straight edges and sharp corners which are typical characteristics of geometric shapes such as rectangles. The color contrasts of the shopping bags are appropriate, which highlights their shapes without causing any distortion in perception. No broken polygons or irregularities are seen. This indicates that the bags retain their geometric integrity, with no visual cues of distortion present.",

      "question": "Is the velvety texture on the coat uniformly applied without unnatural shine or inconsistent surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat has a consistent texture that appears velvety, which is indicated by the even color and lack of irregular reflections. Velvety fabrics typically diffuse light softly, as observed here, and the appearance of the coat maintains this characteristic across the surface without any signs of synthetic shine or disrupted texture patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glossy gloves visually consistent in shape and reflection, with no distorted finger joints or misplaced highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gloves in Image B appear to have a smooth and glossy finish, which is consistent with how such material reflects light evenly at the crests of the fingers. The overall shape of the gloves is well-defined, with contours matching the natural anatomy of hands. The reflections are appropriately located where the gloves would naturally catch light, showing no awkward highlights that would suggest distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the abstract retail symbols positioned around the subject without overlapping or intersecting with her body or shopping bags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible abstract retail symbols positioned in a manner that they interfere with the subject or the shopping bags. The image features only the woman and shopping bags against a simple background without additional symbols that could interact or intersect with her form.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the open panel for personal messages blend seamlessly into the background with matching lighting and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is uniform in color and texture, with an even distribution of light. No distinct panel or area is visible where a message could be integrated, suggesting that if there is a designated area for such a panel, it aligns well with the overall background. The lack of disparity in lighting or surface texture indicates a seamless blend.",
