    "Question": "Q1: Does the geisha's face retain anatomical accuracy with natural proportions and smooth contours despite the stained glass transformation?",
    "explanation": "Stained glass art typically emphasizes the outlines and fills of a subject rather than the precise detailing found in realistic imagery. However, since the face is blurred, we can't evaluate its anatomical accuracy or proportions. Despite this, stained glass transformations often retain recognizable facial outlines and smooth contours. In this image, from the visible parts outside the blur, we can infer that the rest of the execution maintains smoothness and coherence consistent with stained glass design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the patterns on the kimono composed of distinct, sharp segments resembling leaded glass, with no blurred edges or unnatural blending between colors?",
    "explanation": "Stained glass art consists of distinct segments defined by lead cames, preventing blending between colors. The edited image displays patterns on the kimono with distinct shapes and sharp segmentations typical of stained glass. The colors appear separated with clear edges that resemble leaded glass pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cherry blossoms exhibit uniform glass-like textures with clear outlines and internal color gradations typical of stained glass, without appearing mushy or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "In stained glass work, the cherry blossoms would have defined outlines and internal color segments separated by lines, giving a glass-like appearance. In the edited image, the cherry blossoms are clear, with distinct outlines and color transitions that are typical of stained glass work, showing no signs of pixelation or mushiness.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the peacock fan have a logical number of feather segments arranged symmetrically around a central spine, with no overlapping or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "The peacock fan in the stained glass image should show symmetry typical in stained glass design, where each segment is aligned around a center point to create a harmonious look. In the edited image, the fan segments appear logically arranged and symmetrical, with no evidence of overlapping or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the background lines smoothly curved and interconnected without abrupt breaks, gaps, or inconsistent thicknesses that suggest rendering artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Stained glass backgrounds often feature smooth, continuous lines with consistent thickness as part of the design. In the edited image, the circular background lines look evenly curved and interconnected without breaks or changes in thickness, staying true to the characteristics of stained glass art.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the hand holding the fan display five clearly defined fingers with proper ergonomics and no extra digits or fused joints?",
    "explanation": "The depiction of human anatomy in stained glass art can be stylized and abstract but usually retains recognizable human features. The hand holding the fan in the edited image shows fingers clearly separated from one another, suggesting proper ergonomics without extra digits or fused joints, consistent with stained glass stylization.",
    "answer": "Yes"
