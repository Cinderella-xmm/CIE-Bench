      "question": "Is the golden halo around the blacksmithâ€™s head smoothly rendered with even luminosity and no jagged edges or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden halo is circular, encompassing the blacksmith's head. Smooth rendering refers to an even, bright surface with no harsh lines or breaks, which is consistent with religious or sacred art styles. Such halos often symbolize divinity or holiness. Based on visual inspection, the halo in Image B appears to be smooth with no disruptors in its shape or luminosity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the flowing robes on the central figure show natural fabric folds and consistent material texture without unnatural stretching or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robes of the central figure are depicted with attention to detail, simulating realistic fabric movement and texture. The folds appear to be naturally draped, consistent with the lighting and expected gravity effects you would observe in real life. Unnatural stretching would break this realistic appearance but is not evident here.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the divine instruments held by the blacksmith clearly derived from the original hammer and tongs, with preserved proportions and no geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blacksmith is holding instruments with distinctive shapes. Divine instruments would typically maintain familiar characteristics of their original forms (hammer and tongs) for recognition. Upon observation, the proportions seem intact, and there are no evident distortions that would alter their geometry in a recognizable way.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing interior of the forge emit consistent radiant light without excessive bloom, pixelation, or irregular ember patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forge is depicted with an interior glow that provides ambient lighting. Consistency in light emission means the light should have a smooth gradient, avoiding any harsh bloom or pixelation, which could disrupt the visual harmony. The ember patterns should naturally radiate heat. The forge's glow appears consistent with these expectations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vine borders and calligraphy evenly distributed along the image edges without overlapping or obscuring the main subject or tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, decorative vine borders and calligraphy frame the image. Effective framing involves clear delineation without intrusion into the central elements. They should outline the main scene without obscuring the central figure or elements, maintaining a balance for aesthetic emphasis. The distribution appears even, focusing on framing rather than obfuscation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands of the blacksmith display anatomically correct five-fingered grips with natural joint alignment and no deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the blacksmith are visible, gripping instruments. An anatomically correct grip would display all five fingers with appropriate proportions and alignments, typical of a human hand in motion. They should show natural extensions flexing around the tools without unrealistic bending or distortion.",
