      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the corners and edges of the hotel building preserved with consistent angles and proportions, and is there a clear transparent boundary (glass) enclosing the scene without warping or breaking the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges and proportions of the hotel building are maintained with consistent angles. This is achieved through the design of a miniature model inside a glass dome, which naturally preserves the shape and proportions. The glass barrier is smooth and round, enclosing the scene without any visible warping or distortion, reflecting a common design for display cases or terrariums. Image A depicts a larger and real hotel structure, with no visible glass enclosure. Comparing both images, the consistent angles and absence of structural warping in Image B are evident due to the controlled miniature design within the glass boundary.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the water layers in the pool show consistent transparency and refraction, allowing visibility of submerged objects and swimmers without jagged edges or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool is depicted as a simple blue area in the miniature model, lacking the distinct layers, transparency, and refraction seen in real water. While the design is neat and free from artifacts, it does not show traditional water properties like transparency or visibility of submerged objects, which is typical in miniature models. In Image A, the pool displays real water characteristics such as refraction and transparency where swimmers are visible. Since Image B is constrained to model design aesthetics rather than replicating real water properties accurately, it lacks these attributes.",

      "question": "Do the sunbathers on the lounge chairs have correctly proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, and do the nearby trees display natural leaf density and branching without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents sunbathers as small figurines in a miniature setting. These figures have basic shapes and simplified features typical of model representations, with limited detail in limbs and clothing due to their scale. The trees are stylized representations, with neat, dense foliage suitable for miniatures, avoiding pixelation. Image A shows real people with visible clothing detail and correctly proportioned limbs, and the trees have natural leaf density and branching. The simplified approach in Image B lacks the nuanced detail visible in the larger, real-life depiction of Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the greenery flowing from the rooftop follow a continuous, downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points, and does it blend naturally with the building’s exterior without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the greenery is positioned neatly around the model hotel building; however, there is no visible attachment or continuous flow of greenery from the rooftop, as the design confines it to stylized bushes around the ground. There’s consistent placement within the glass dome, but it doesn’t mimic natural flow from a rooftop setting. Image A does not feature such rooftop greenery, focusing instead on ground-level foliage. Thus, Image B’s miniature representation does not have the greenery flowing from rooftop features nor misplacement issues with the glass dome constraints.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the beach accessories near the pool edge correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture, and do they have natural material textures (e.g., fabric, plastic)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pool-side scene features simplified accessories like lounge chairs that appear properly placed and scaled for the miniature model without overlapping incorrectly with the figures. Textures are simplified and appropriate for the model context, lacking realistic material detail due to scale constraints. Image A depicts a real-life scene with accessories that exhibit texture details and correct size. Comparing both, Image B maintains proper placement and scaling for the miniature setting, but doesn't address realistic material textures given the miniature design context.",

      "question": "Do the floating 3D clouds exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model includes floating clouds that are stylized above the building with soft gradients that complement the miniature aesthetic. They float independently without interfacing with the building, maintaining lighting consistent with the scene's overall design. Image A, however, depicts natural clouds in the sky, which are larger and display natural coloration. Image B’s model design achieves visual consistency through well-placed, lightweight clouds appropriate for a model environment, maintaining aesthetic harmony.",
