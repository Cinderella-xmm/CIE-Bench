      "question": "Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is positioned to appear as though they are emerging from the screen of the television. The key area to examine is the boundary where the character overlaps or interacts with the screen. Observing Image B, this boundary is relatively smooth and coherent, with no evident seams, lines, or distractions that disrupt the visual appeal. The integration is seamless enough not to draw attention to the impossibility or artificial construction, which suggests that there are no noticeable artifacts or unnatural textures at the intersection.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the shield held in a manner that complements the character's posture without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is holding a shield prominently, which is a central element of the costume. The position and orientation of the shield and the character's arm need to be examined to see if they preserve the natural geometric shapes. In the image, the shield appears well-positioned, with the character's arms in a natural fighting pose, and there are no visible breaks, twists, or distortions in the structure of the shield or the arm holding it.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and reflections on the character's suit consistent with the environment, avoiding any loss of details or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the character's suit should reflect and interact with the surrounding environment's light sources realistically to maintain consistency. The suit in Image B exhibits appropriate highlights and shadows that align with the general lighting direction coming from the screen, and the textures are detailed with no evident flattening or overly smooth areas. This indicates that the lighting matches well with the environment, avoiding abnormal textures or loss of detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the visible parts of the characterâ€™s body maintain proper proportions, avoiding distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we look closely at the character's proportion regarding head, torso, limbs, and overall scale. The character's body seems correctly scaled with life-like proportions that mirror a plausible human anatomy, suggesting careful attention to dimensional integrity without any distortion or unnatural stretching/shrinking of body parts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the character breaking out of the screen maintain the visual continuity of the background and avoid disrupting other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The editing involves adding a character seemingly emerging from the television screen, which needs to be assessed for integration with the background. In Image B, the television set, the room setting, and any objects involved maintain their integrity, and the presence of the character does not introduce disorder or interfere with other background elements, resulting in a harmonious scene.",
