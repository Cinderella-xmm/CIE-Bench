    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modified object has been transformed into a serpent-like figure made up of bead segments. The visual layout of these 'beads' gives a smooth and continuous appearance akin to a real snake’s body, as there is a clear, natural curve throughout the structure, with no visible breaks or misalignments in the connections between the beads. This arrangement imitates the graceful, fluid motion typical of a serpent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the large blue circular elements are evident near what seems to be the head portion of the serpent. These elements are placed symmetrically, giving the impression of eyes, which is a common characteristic of animal representations. They are well-integrated into the serpent's surface, appearing as natural features rather than as separate or floating parts, enhancing the realistic portrayal of the serpent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black tribal patterns in Image B wrap around the segments of the serpent in a way that follows the body's contours. The markings appear designed to enhance the flowing appearance of the serpent, avoiding any jagged corners or repetitive patterns that would indicate digital modification or artifacting. The natural integration of these marks supports the organic look of the entire structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the tail of the serpent extends gracefully from the lower end of the body. It visibly tapers, maintaining a fluid connection with the body before ending in smaller bead-like tips. These tips add to the perception of looseness and fluid motion, characteristic of an animal’s tail, avoiding any breaks in continuity which would look disjointed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface texture of the serpent in Image B appears consistent and similar in finish to the original beads depicted in Image A. It maintains a slight glossy sheen that aligns with the reflective nature of the beads, devoid of any unnatural shiny spots or areas that are excessively rough, retaining a uniform visual feel throughout the serpent's body segments.",
