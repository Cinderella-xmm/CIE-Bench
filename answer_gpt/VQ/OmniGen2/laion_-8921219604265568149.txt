    "Question": "Q1: Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the façade of the cathedral is clearly made from a resin material, which is typically used for model making due to its smooth and uniform surface. The texture in Image B lacks the intricate textures and depth seen in traditional stone structures as observed in Image A. The resin gives it a plastic-like appearance, which contrasts sharply with the rough and varied texture of stone in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figures are designed to be proportionally smaller as expected in a model or display case scenario. Their scaling appears consistent with traditional diorama techniques, where smaller figures are used to convey depth and perspective relative to larger structures such as buildings. The positioning of these figures is such that they don't look stretched or misaligned; they are appropriately scaled and positioned relative to the cathedral model.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lamps within the display case emit a soft, localized light that is consistent with the size and intended function of miniature lamps. This type of lighting is appropriate for scale models, avoiding unrealistic glows that might occur if the lights were disproportionately bright compared to their size. The light emitted appears controlled, focusing on the immediate vicinity without lighting areas that should naturally remain shadowed, maintaining the integrity of the display's appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the display case fully integrated around the cathedral and square with clean, continuous edges and no intersecting or fragmented parts that disrupt the geometry of the original structures?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a well-crafted integration of the display case with the cathedral model inside. The edges are clean and continuous, fitting seamlessly around the exhibit. The design ensures that the model fits well within the case boundaries, maintaining the integrity of the structure's geometry. Unlike Image A, where the original architecture exists without a case, Image B's case fully integrates the scene, supporting the display's geometry without fragmentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the engraved plaque clearly visible, properly aligned, and styled with appropriate depth and lettering that matches the baroque aesthetic without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plaque is designed to be clearly visible and is properly aligned beneath the model. The text appears engraved, providing depth and an authentic look consistent with traditional brass or metal plaques. Its style, depth, and alignment complement the baroque aesthetic appropriately. The lettering doesn't appear flat or digitally imposed; it retains an evident texture and prominence that is typical of engraved metal plaques.",
    "answer": "Yes"
