    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed towers retain the original stone texture and structural lines, and are they shaped into arms without geometric distortion or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the golem, which are part of the transformation of the landscape, display a texture resembling that of the stone buildings seen in New York City. The structural lines appear cohesive and follow natural contours without evident breaks or distortions. This indicates that the transformation creatively integrates architectural elements to form the arms of the golem without significant loss of texture or structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suspension cables rendered as continuous, sinewy tendons with consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest area, without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge that now resemble sinewy tendons across the golem’s chest. They maintain a continuous metallic texture and have a natural curvature, seamlessly fitting onto the shape of the golem's body. There is no observable fraying, and their thickness remains consistent, supporting the notion of a thoughtful integration into the golem design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower transformed into a crown with clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally and are positioned directly above the golem’s head without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top part of the Freedom Tower is transformed into the golem’s crown in Image B. It displays clear, faceted surfaces akin to crystals that appear to reflect light, contributing to a realistic effect. The crown is positioned directly above the golem's head, without any visible misalignment or detachment, indicating careful placement in the design process.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers seamlessly integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows skyscrapers integrated into the golem’s body, resembling armor plating. The integration appears smooth, as the edges of the buildings align well without visible gaps or overlaps. The thoughtful fusion of architectural forms into the design aids in maintaining the integrity and coherence of the golem's structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the golem’s base fully anchored to the ground and water, with no floating or disconnected limbs, and does its overall scale match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem's base is visually grounded, displaying a natural and secure fit into the scenery. The legs appear as continuous extensions from the base to the ground, fitting naturally with the water and surrounding environment without showing signs of floating or disconnection. Despite the fantastical scale, the golem’s size is thoughtfully set into the city's scale, maintaining a sense of realism within the fictional scenario.",
