      "question": "Does the keychain appear to be naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image of the keychain does not display any apparent signs of digital manipulation or superimposition onto the background. The edges are smooth, and there is no evident mismatch in lighting or shadows that would suggest artificial placement. The entire scene looks naturally cohesive, indicating careful attention to detail. Thus, the keychain appears to be naturally integrated into the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the keychain's features consistent with the chibi-style representation of the subject, preserving structural coherence and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain is in a distinct chibi-style, characterized by exaggerated, rounded proportions, and simple features, which are consistent with how chibi representations typically appear. The oversized head, simplified facial features, and small body match the stylistic conventions of chibi art, maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the keychain maintain essential details that make the subject recognizable, avoiding distortions such as broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain maintains clear and intact features such as the large eyes, button details on the dress, and the distinct hairstyle, which are crucial for recognition. There are no broken or distorted elements, ensuring the subject remains recognizable and the features are conveyed effectively.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the materials of the keychain, specifically the soft rubber texture and bold black outlines, accurately represented without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain displays a matte, slightly rubbery texture, which is typical for keychains of this type. The bold black outlines provide clear separation between different colored sections, which is a common design choice in chibi merchandise. The textures and outlines appear natural and consistent with similar real-life items.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the small silver keyring attached to the keychain appear proportionally correct and physically plausible, contributing to the overall visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keyring is proportionally adequate in relation to the size of the keychain. It is made of a metallic material that reflects light similarly across its surface, ensuring a realistic appearance. This proportionality and material representation make the entire keychain set look physically plausible.",
