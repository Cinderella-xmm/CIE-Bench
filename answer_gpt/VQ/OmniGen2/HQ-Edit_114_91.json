    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the ivy formations on the hammerhead shaped like symmetrical, watchful eyes with natural leaf arrangement and no visible digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible hammerhead with ivy formations resembling watchful eyes. Instead, an owl with bright emerald eyes, which might be perceived as watchful, sits atop a transformed anvil. The owl appears stylized and is embellished with green and wooden textures that give it a natural, forest-like appearance. Therefore, based on the image content, the answer is clear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered bark texture cover the hammer and anvil uniformly without abrupt color shifts, patchy areas, or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts an owl sitting on a transformed anvil covered in moss and bark that mimics a natural tree stump. The textures appear consistently applied over the surface with a smooth transition between elements, creating a harmonious visual appeal. There are no visible signs of abrupt color shifts or synthetic-looking patterns.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anvil is transformed to resemble a tree stump with root-like structures extending downward. These root-like structures taper in thickness, resembling natural tree roots, and are seamlessly connected to the base without any floating or disconnected segments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows emerald runes on the owl sitting on a tree stump-like anvil. These runes are embedded into the surface, appearing carved into the bark texture. They emit a subtle glow that integrates naturally into the surrounding texture, creating a cohesive design without noticeable pixelation or stark outlines.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature window frames, a floor, or ivy tendrils in the manner described. Instead, it presents a mystical forest scene with an owl atop an anvil-like tree stump adorned with leaves and moss, but no ivy tendrils wrapping around it or following logical paths as described in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the transformed anvil and hammer fall consistently with the light source from the window, and do they interact naturally with the wooden table and surrounding tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has transitioned into a forest environment with no window-derived light source or the original workshop setting. The scene features diffused, natural light consistent with a forest ambiance, creating uniform and natural shadows from the owl and tree stump, without reference to a window or tools.",
