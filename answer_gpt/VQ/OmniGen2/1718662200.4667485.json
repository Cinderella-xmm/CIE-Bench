    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's head appears to be proportionate to its body. There are no visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area that suggest disproportion or awkward transition from head to body. The pig's head is large as characterized by its design but fits well with the body structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't show any green sunglasses; instead, the pig appears with no added accessory like sunglasses. The character design features a plain view without additional eyewear. Therefore, this question doesn't apply to Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's hands are visible but not detailed enough to discern five fingers, suggesting a stylized rather than anatomically accurate representation. The design may focus more on a cartoonish feel rather than realistic animal anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the watercolor background integrate smoothly with the pig and DJ equipment, showing no abrupt edges or conflicting lighting patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watercolor background in Image B provides a vivid, seamless backdrop for the pig and DJ equipment. There are smooth gradients and consistent lighting patterns that complement the main subjects without any abrupt edges or discord in the lighting effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chat bubbles and surrounding soundwave patterns clearly defined, free of jagged edges, and positioned without obstructing key features like the face or turntable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chat bubbles and soundwave patterns are distinctly defined, with smooth edges and strategic placement that prevents obstruction of key elements like the face or the turntable. The design ensures these graphic elements do not interfere with the primary visual focus.",
