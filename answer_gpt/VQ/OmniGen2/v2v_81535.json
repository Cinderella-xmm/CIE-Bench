      "question": "Do the blue dragons' scales seamlessly integrate with the bowl's blue floral design without appearing as unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two blue dragon figures appear to be entwined around the bowl. Upon close inspection, the dragons' scales and features, while matching in color with the bowl's floral design, clearly stand out as separate and attached entities. This is evidenced by their distinct texture and 3D appearance that contrasts with the 2D design of the bowl. The dragons don't look like they are part of the original bowl design and appear more like add-ons, highlighting a clear distinction between the dragons and the floral motifs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wisps of orange smoke naturally integrated into the scene, complementing the curry without looking out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a presence of smoke above the dish. This smoke appears unrealistically colored in orange, which is unusual for smoke, as it typically appears white or grey. Additionally, the smoke does not blend naturally with the scene as it appears quite defined and lacks the typical gradient or soft edges that natural smoke would have. Therefore, it looks out of place and like an artificial edit rather than a complementary element to the curry.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dragon eggs retain the shape and texture of the original chicken pieces, ensuring they look like solidified curry without losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dish appears to contain egg-shaped objects rather than the original chicken pieces. Unlike chicken, which typically has a textured and irregular surface, these eggs have smooth surfaces and distinct, uniform shapes, which don't resemble solidified curry or chicken. Therefore, they do not retain the original shape and texture details of the chicken pieces, looking instead like completely different entities.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blue dragons positioned naturally above the dragon eggs, maintaining a playful yet coherent interaction without breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue dragon figures appear positioned above the dish and around the bowl. Their placement seems arbitrary rather than integrated, especially because the dragons' joining the scene doesn't exhibit any interaction with the other elements, such as the dragon eggs, or playfulness within the general setting. Additionally, their design is quite bold and visually distinct from the rest of the image, suggesting an inconsistency in the scene's structural elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the edited image, including the transformed cilantro, dragon eggs, and smoke, maintain a natural and authentic appearance without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several edits have been made, including the introduction of blue dragons, dragon eggs, and orange smoke. Each of these elements stands out distinctly as artifacts rather than blending naturally into the scene. The dragons appear pasted, the dragon eggs do not seamlessly replace the chicken pieces, and the smoke doesnâ€™t blend with the scene's atmosphere. These elements as a whole create an edited appearance that disrupts the natural authenticity of the original scene.",
