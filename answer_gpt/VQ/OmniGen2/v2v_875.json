      "question": "Are the edges of the palm tree and cactus seamlessly integrated into the Polaroid frame without visible artifacts or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree and cactus appear perfectly contained within the Polaroid frame, without any visible artifacts or unnatural breaks along their edges. The edges are crisp and align well with the Polaroid format. This indicates a seamless integration into the frame, using visual cues combined with common sense about photography and digital editing techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style cactus maintain its original green color and texture, avoiding unnatural color shifts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style cactus retains the green color typical of cacti and does not exhibit any apparent unnatural color shifts or loss of detail. The texture appears consistent with a well-rendered 3D object, maintaining the expected properties of a cactus's surface. This observation is based on visual inspection and the understanding of digital rendering standards.",

      "question": "Does the human hand holding the Polaroid photograph appear anatomically correct with natural skin texture and no more than five fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human hand holding the Polaroid is depicted with a natural skin texture and anatomy. It clearly shows the appropriate number of fingers, which is five, and the hand appears realistic, taking into consideration the proportions and details like nails and skin creases. This deduction is based on standard anatomy knowledge and visual observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition where the 3D chibi-style cactus appears to break out of the Polaroid frame smooth and believable, without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication visually that the 3D chibi-style cactus breaks out of the Polaroid frame. The cactus stays within the boundaries set by the Polaroid, and there are no signs of it breaking or extending beyond, maintaining a coherent perspective without distorted or broken shapes. This is inferred from the consistent placement within the picture's frame.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the palm tree, cactus, and the 3D chibi-style cactus align naturally with the light source in the image, avoiding any artificial highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on all objects seem consistent with a single light source, possibly the sun, as indicated by the shadows and highlights on the palm tree, cactus, and 3D chibi-style object. The shadows fall in a logical direction consistent with the lighting, without any artificial highlights or inconsistent dark areas. This understanding is based on typical shadow behavior in natural lighting.",
