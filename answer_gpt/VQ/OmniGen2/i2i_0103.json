      "question": "Have the brushstrokes added to the sofa preserved its structural integrity without causing distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa appears to be rendered with swirling, painterly strokes, indicative of a Van Gogh style. Despite this artistic overlay, the sofa maintains its original structure and proportions. The cushions and overall form of the sofa are clearly understood without any distortion or collapse in the shape, even with the enhanced texture. This preservation of form suggests that while the texture has changed, the structure remains intact and not distorted.",

      "question": "Does the wall, including the framed painting, appear naturally integrated with the rest of the room after the style conversion, without any broken geometric shapes or lost fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall and the framed painting are part of a cohesive visual style that integrates Van Gogh-like brushstrokes. The wall and painting do not exhibit any broken or unclear geometric shapes. The structural elements such as corners, edges, and framing are retained, providing visual coherence with the rest of the room. This suggests a successful integration without losing crucial details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the plant's leaves depicted with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes while still retaining a recognizable and plausible appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plant in Image B shows a Van Gogh-like interpretation with swirling strokes. Despite this stylization, the leaves remain identifiable as leaves of a common indoor plant. The shape and color scheme stay consistent with what one would expect from a plant, avoiding any bizarre forms that would render them unidentifiable or “unnatural.” Hence, the depiction remains plausible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the side table and lamp been converted to fit the Van Gogh style while preserving their realistic proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side table and lamp in Image B display the characteristic brushstroke style of Van Gogh. Despite this, they maintain their original forms and functional aspects. The lamp's shape is discernible, retaining its essential design with no loss of structural integrity or proportion. Similarly, the table stands correctly, reflecting proper perspective. Thus, the stylization respects their realistic proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all elements in the room maintain a harmonious and plausible arrangement in Van Gogh style, ensuring no disruption in the spatial relationships among objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a unified aesthetic where all room elements—furniture, lamp, plant, and painting—are converted to a Van Gogh artistic style. The spatial relationships among objects, such as distance and alignment, remain consistent and believable. Each object occupies its expected place harmoniously, reinforcing a coherent room setup despite stylistic changes.",
