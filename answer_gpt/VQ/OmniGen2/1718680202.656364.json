      "question": "Are the beach-themed stickers on the capybara's beanie clearly visible and seamlessly blended into the knit fabric without any jagged edges or texture distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beanie of the capybara does not display any visible stickers or decorative motifs. It appears as a plain blue knit beanie, free from any additional adornments. The texture looks smooth and consistent, which means there are no jagged edges or texture distortions caused by stickers or other elements. Since no stickers are present, they are neither visible nor blended.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color of the beanie and the beverage uniformly saturated without unnatural color bleeding or digital halos around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beanie and the orange beverage are analyzed for color saturation and any signs of bleeding or halos. The beanie maintains a consistent blue color throughout, and the beverage appears vibrantly orange, both with clear edges that do not exhibit signs of digital artifacts such as color bleeding or halos. This consistency suggests proper saturation without unnatural effects.",

      "question": "Does the arched typography sit correctly above the Opera House without distorting its shape or creating visual inconsistencies in scale and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arched typography over the Opera House reads 'A Capy-bharda's Sydney Escape.' The text appears proportionately sized in relation to the structure of the Opera House, with a consistent arch that does not seem to warp its letters or create scale issues. The typography sits seamlessly in the image, suggesting correct placement without distortion.",

      "question": "Does the capybaraâ€™s hand holding the drink have five fingers with natural spacing, ergonomic curvature, and realistic texture without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's hand is analyzed for anatomical accuracy. The hand appears to have four visible fingers with an appropriate grip around the drink, demonstrating natural spacing and curvature appropriate for grasping an object. There are no extra fingers or visible distortions, though it falls short of the typical human-like five-finger structure.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and reflections on the capybara, the drink, and the water surface align consistently with the direction of the sunset in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting and reflections are evaluated. The capybara, beverage, and water surface demonstrate lighting consistency with a clear bright and warm sunlight source. Shadows and highlights on these objects seem in sync with the background indicating a light source, assuming a daytime scenario with brighter light sources, and not a sunset which would cast warmer and softer light.",
