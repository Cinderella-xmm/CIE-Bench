      "question": "Does the anime-style conversion of the athlete retain the original pose structure without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete retains the same crouching pose as in Image A, which involves bending the knees and positioning the arms in a way typical for preparation in tennis. The limbs and body are proportioned correctly, showing no signs of distortion that would deviate from natural human anatomy. The conversion to an anime style involves a more stylized color palette and outlines but does not alter the underlying structure of the pose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced facial expressions (focused eyes and light effects) integrated seamlessly into the athlete's face and do not appear as unnatural overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is designed in an anime style with vibrant colors and effects, typical for conveying emotion and intensity. The addition of light effects and possibly more pronounced eye details are characteristic of this style and generally blend in with the overall animation. There are no harsh borders or mismatched elements indicating it as an 'overlay', suggesting integration is smooth within the style's context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the added background energy glow contribute positively to the atmosphere without causing unnatural lighting or breaking the scene's visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glow in Image B acts as an energy aura typical in dynamic anime scenes—intended to enhance action or focus. This effect is consistent with the style and doesn't introduce unnatural lighting that clashes with the colors and shadows in the scene. The glow cohesively enhances rather than overwhelms the scene, maintaining visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the proportions and physical realism of the athlete’s hands, feet, and tennis racket been maintained during the style conversion, avoiding unnatural shapes or sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete's hands and feet, along with the tennis racket, retain realistic proportions similar to those in Image A. Despite being an anime-style rendition, which might typically involve exaggeration, all elements appear appropriately sized and shaped, reflecting accurate physical realism relative to the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character card banner format present the edited athlete in a manner that retains authenticity and visual clarity, without sacrificing the original scene’s natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the anime style alters the overall aesthetics, the scene's composition relating to the athlete, court elements, and branding retains clarity. Adjustments do not obscure or overly clutter the view. The authenticity here lies in maintaining the sporting context. The banner preserves the fundamental aspects, ensuring the scene does not lose its recognizability or narrative.",
