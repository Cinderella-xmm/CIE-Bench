      "question": "Are the reflections on the carsâ€™ surfaces clear and consistent with their surroundings without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflections on the cars' surfaces appear smooth and aligned with the lighting conditions of the environment. The surface reflections accurately depict elements like the trees and traffic lights, indicating realism and a natural reflection. There are no visible distortions or artifacts that seem out of place given the scene's atmospheric conditions. This suggests careful attention to maintaining the integrity of reflections during editing.",

      "question": "Does the enhanced environmental haze create a realistic atmospheric depth without blurring or distorting the structural elements of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an increased sense of atmospheric depth due to enhanced environmental haze, which is typical in scenes portraying early morning or foggy conditions. This effect helps in creating a depth perspective that is visually coherent. The haze does not significantly blur or distort key elements like cars, road, and traffic lights, allowing these remain recognizable and structurally correct. Therefore, the effect of depth perception is achieved realistically without compromising structural clarity.",

      "question": "Has the increased contrast enhanced the visual impact without producing unnatural colors or excessive glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contrast appears moderately increased, providing a vivid and dynamic visual without pushing color tones to unnatural extremes. The color tones of the cars and environment retain a natural look, balanced well within realistic bounds, and there is no noticeable increase in glare that would distract from the scene's overall appearance. Thus, the enhancement in contrast seems well-executed to boost visual attention without compromising naturalness.",

      "question": "Does the movie poster style conversion maintain visual credibility with the traffic lights and road markings appearing undistorted and logically intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, despite possible stylistic modifications to achieve a movie poster-like quality, retains clarity and aligns with real-world logic. The traffic lights and road markings are sharp and appear consistent with expected standards. The conversion strategy focuses more on atmospheric and tonal adjustments rather than distorting primary scene elements. Hence, the integrity of recognizable features such as traffic lights and road markings remains intact, contributing to a credible scene representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the cars, such as paint texture and taillight designs, been preserved without introducing unnatural artifacts or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the minute details of the cars, including paint texture and taillight designs, are well preserved. The clarity of these details signifies careful editing and processing to maintain fidelity to the original scene, avoiding any degradation or introduction of artefacts that may occur due to processing errors. The cars' surfaces and details are visually rich and clear, indicating the preservation of these elements through the editing work.",
