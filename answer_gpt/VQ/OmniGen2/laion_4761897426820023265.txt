    "Question": "Q1: Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
    "explanation": "The edge of the snow globe in Image B appears to have a smooth and continuous surface, characteristic of a well-made glass object. There are no visible seams or distortions along its surface, which would indicate high-quality craftsmanship. This observation is consistent with the appearance of a typical snow globe, designed to have a seamless and clear glass surface for optimal visibility of the contents within.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe surface shows reflections and refractions that mimic those found in clear glass objects. The reflections are soft and highlight the curvature of the glass, while the refractions subtly bend the image of the scene behind it, indicating attention to realistic lighting behavior. This is consistent with how light interacts with a curved glass surface, providing a realistic visual effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
    "explanation": "The figures inside the snow globe in Image B appear to have complete and proportionally correct limbs. None of the figures exhibit extra fingers or missing limbs, and their postures are natural and not distorted. This is indicative of careful digital rendering or modeling, ensuring a realistic portrayal of human forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
    "explanation": "The autumn-colored leaves within the snow globe in Image B are integrated smoothly into the existing vegetation. There is a natural transition between the colors, with no abrupt changes or visible blocky textures that would suggest a digital overlay. This seamless blending contributes to the overall realistic and cohesive appearance of the scene inside the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, snow particles are depicted in a dynamic, swirling pattern within the globe, which adds to the typical aesthetic of a snow globe. The particles do not obscure the Great Wall or the figures, as those elements remain prominently visible. This indicates that the snow effect was thoughtfully applied to maintain the clarity and focus on the key elements within the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic birds are represented as small flying objects with clearly defined wings and bodies, positioned in the air above the Wall. They do not appear to be in contact with any surfaces, indicating that their placement within the scene is intentional to create the effect of flight. This adds to the dynamic and artistic nature of the scene within the snow globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
    "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B is dark in color with realistic wood grain texture, typical of finely crafted bases for decorative objects. It supports the snow globe solidly, neither floating nor tilting. The engraved text on the base is clear and legible, adding a personalized or thematic element to the snow globe, which enhances both its aesthetic and sentimental value.",
    "answer": "Yes"
