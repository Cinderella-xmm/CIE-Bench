    "Question": "Q2: Is the transparent label positioned on the teapotâ€™s body with uniform opacity and no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges?",
    "explanation": "The label on the teapot in Image B features text saying 'Earl Grey Elegance.' Visually analyzing the label, it maintains uniform opacity and clarity over the teapot surface. The text edges are sharp, with no pixelation or ghosting effects which would usually suggest poor graphic implementation or unfinished editing.",
