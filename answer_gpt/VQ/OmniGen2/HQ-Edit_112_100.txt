    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the glass dome surrounding the eagle appears smooth and uniformly curved, displaying realistic transparency. It allows clear visibility of the eagle and the background elements like the miniature clouds without any noticeable distortion. The way light interacts with the dome shows a natural refraction, maintaining the objects' true forms and colors. This reflects an understanding of how glass typically interacts with light, where transparency should not distort underlying structures if properly executed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature clouds beneath the eagle's wings display a three-dimensional appearance with well-distributed lighting that enhances their volume and form. The texture, although stylized, attempts to convey a fluffy, cloud-like consistency, aligning with natural cloud formations. Their placement and shadowing are coherent with the rest of the scene, providing a sense of realism in line with common representations of clouds.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds shows a reflective metallic texture that catches light, reflecting it naturally. This detail does not overly contrast with the cloud's base color or setting, preventing harsh highlights that could affect the cloud's natural appearance. The reflective quality and subtle application of the gold leaf maintain the cloud's aesthetics, demonstrating an understanding of how metallic and non-metallic surfaces interact with light.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dark wood base appears with a natural wood grain texture and polished finish, lending authenticity and depth. The text, although engraved, is clearly legible, fitting naturally onto the base surface. The proportion and connection between the dome and wood base seem stable and proportionate, emphasizing an understanding of the balance needed for such display pieces. This indicates a realistic approach to depicting wooden finishes and engravings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts brass compass roses that appear evenly spaced and correctly shaped according to a compass's geometric features. They show a metallic texture, reflective of brass, catching light appropriately to highlight their details. Their scale is proportionate to the dome and base, preserving the overall balance and design coherence of the piece. This captures an understanding of designing decorative metallic elements to enhance visual harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"
