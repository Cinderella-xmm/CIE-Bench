    "Question": "Q1: Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is a soft toy with consistent plush fabric texture rather than glass. The pink color of the plush appears even, and there is no indication of translucent glass material with bubble textures. The plush material provides a uniform appearance without jagged or inconsistent texture typical of plush toys. World knowledge about fabric toys informs this observation.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow belly of the seahorse is plastic rather than glass. The smoothness is more of molded plastic, which often resembles glass but tends to have a different appearance. The music note inside the heart is printed onto the plastic and appears precise, consistent with manufacturing standards for toys. However, the material and printing process are not etched glass elements.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows ribbons made from satin fabric, which have reflections characteristic of textile material rather than glass. They exhibit a natural curvature and softness that maintains their shape without any stretching or flattening. The use of fabric is evident from both tactile and visual cues, typical for children's toys.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the seahorse toy positioned on a flat black surface with reflective qualities, showing mirror-like reflections. The stand seems integrated well, without apparent gaps or floating effects under the toy, suggesting a good visual blend of the base with the environment, characteristic of polished bases often found in displays or platforms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?",
    "explanation": "Image B has a consistent lighting scheme enhancing the toy's features without mismatched highlights or artificial edges. The plush body, plastic belly, satin ribbons, and reflective base are well-integrated with good consistency in the depiction of material properties and shadows, indicating consistent photography techniques common in product presentations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
