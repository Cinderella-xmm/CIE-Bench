      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot visually appears to be made of clear glass. The material shows internal reflections and refractions typical of transparent glass, with highlights and shadows that suggest its clarity and transparency. There is no presence of metallic residues, marking a distinct difference from metallic teapots which would have a different light reflection pattern. This conclusion is based on the light behavior and visual transparency seen in glass materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the teapot in Image B appear uniformly frosted, with a consistent and smooth texture that aligns with the typical appearance of glass etching. The opacity is even across the patterns, with no signs of smudging or texture artifacts that might indicate a poor quality or artificially applied texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle and spout in Image B display a consistent amber tint, showcasing a smooth gradient from the base to the edges. The color transitions smoothly without fringing or jarring highlights that would appear unnatural. This smoothness and precision in color suggest high-quality material or rendering consistent with well-crafted glass objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the object’s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection of the teapot in Image B is symmetrical and sharp, closely aligning with the base of the object. The contours are well-defined, maintaining the shape of the teapot. Furthermore, the reflection effectively conveys the transparency effects of the glass, enhancing the realistic depiction of a reflective surface typically found with glass on a shiny base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the teapot's components – lid, spout, handle, and body – appear appropriate and harmonious, similar to naturally occurring proportions in well-crafted teapots. There are no visible errors in alignment, stretching, or compression, which means the proportions appear to be intact and consistent with typical teapot designs. This comparison shows that no sections are misaligned or distorted compared to standard teapot structure.",
