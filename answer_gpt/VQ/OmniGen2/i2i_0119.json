      "question": "Does the keychain version of the character maintain the same proportions and colors as the original image, without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain version of the character retains the original proportions and colors seen in Image A, which are distinct for the character 'Psyduck.' This character has a consistent yellow color, large head featuring a circular white eye with black pupils, and a large cream-colored bill, which are accurately depicted in both images. There are no distortions or unnatural textures present in Image B, thus maintaining fidelity to the original character depiction.",

      "question": "Does the keychain appear naturally placed on the desk with appropriate shadows and reflections, indicating a realistic interaction with the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain version of the character is placed on the desk with shadows that follow the direction of the light source visible in the ambient setting, making the placement look natural and realistic. The shadow beneath the keychain matches typical shadow behavior, suggesting a solid placement on the desk surface.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the books and glasses placed next to the keychain rendered with realistic textures and a consistent level of detail, without any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The books feature visible texture and clear detail in the corners and covers, and the glasses exhibit reflections on the lenses, characteristic of realistic rendering. These elements have coherent textures and detailing consistent with real-world counterparts, without visible artifacts or inconsistencies.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the keychain, books, and glasses in Image B are sharply defined and do not show signs of blurring or blending with the background. This sharpness helps distinguish each object clearly, maintaining their integrity against the desk and surrounding elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The books are stacked neatly, and the glasses are placed with the temples resting on the desk, aligning with their expected placement in a real-world scenario. This arrangement is consistent with common desk organization and usage, contributing to a natural scene setup.",
