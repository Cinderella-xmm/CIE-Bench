    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the lionâ€™s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is depicted as a silhouette, with a smooth outline that suggests correct anatomical proportions typical of a lion, including the recognizable mane and posture. The edges of the silhouette are clear with no pixelation or geometric distortion, which would indicate a degradation of quality or implausible shape.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop of Image B features a gradient transitioning from a light color at the bottom to a slightly darker hue at the top. This gradient is executed smoothly, with no visible banding or abrupt color boundaries, creating a natural and aesthetically pleasing transition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass is rendered as a silhouette, similar to the lion. This approach eliminates concerns about natural light interaction and pattern repetition, as the focus is on shape rather than texture. The silhouette integrates well into the overall image composition, maintaining coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The acacia trees in Image B are depicted as silhouettes with recognizable forms and smooth, continuous lines, typical of these types of trees. The trees are visually balanced, with no broken branches or unnatural angles that would disrupt the natural look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'KING OF THE WILD' is placed prominently above the lion's silhouette. It is positioned well above the head so as not to overlap, maintaining a clean separation and ensuring legibility. The high contrast between the black text and the lighter background ensures no visual noise or distortion impairs readability.",
