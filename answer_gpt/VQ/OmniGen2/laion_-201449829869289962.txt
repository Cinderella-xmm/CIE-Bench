    "Question": "Q1: Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dome glass case appears to exhibit smooth transparency, which is typical of a well-crafted glass material. This is evident from the realistic light reflections and refractions that suggest proper interaction with the surrounding elements. There are no visible distortions or inconsistencies such as stitching or warping, indicating high-quality rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings inside the glass dome appear to be uniformly reduced, maintaining proportional relations typical of real-world constructions. This consistency suggests a careful scaling down, as the structures do not appear distorted or disproportionately sized relative to one another.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the small houses added around the diorama match the original architectural style seen in European rural settings with appropriate roof shapes, windows, and textures. They appear integrated naturally with no visible deformations or anomalies, adhering to the thematic consistency of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the copper roof shows texture variations that mimic the metal's characteristics, including shine and slight oxidation effects. The lighting response also appears consistent with how copper would reflect and absorb light, providing a convincing representation consistent with real-world copper structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mist over the distant mountains is smoothly diffused, showcasing a gradual change in opacity that is typical of real mist in mountainous settings. There are no abrupt edges or pixelated patterns, indicating a well-implemented atmospheric effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold pedestal is centered beneath the diorama, providing it with a stable base, typical of well-constructed display stands. It appears solid and grounded, with no evidence of misalignment or floating elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the terraced vineyards are depicted with consistent spacing and natural curvature, presenting a visually appealing pattern typical of such agricultural landscapes. There are no visible grid lines or pixelation, suggesting high-quality rendering of these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
