      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen emerge naturally from the phone without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic projection screen appears to float above the sandwich, emitting a glow without an apparent connection to a phone or other projection device in Image B. This addition disrupts the image's natural flow, as there is no visual logic explaining its presence or origin. Typically, a holographic display would emerge from a device, but this is absent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or unnatural colors where the holographic screen connects with the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a holographic screen with glowing blue hues, contrasting sharply with the warmer tones of the sandwich and surroundings. This color disparity suggests a lack of blending, leading to unnatural aesthetics. Despite this, no physical connections are visible between the screen and any phone, leaving it seemingly suspended without artifacts indicative of physical integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dimensions of the holographic projection screen match the scale of the surrounding objects in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic projection screen in Image B is considerably smaller than the sandwich, implying that it is out of scale compared to surrounding objects. Real-world understanding suggests a projection screen should be sizeable enough to convey useful visual information, ideally larger to maintain readability. However, here, it appears almost detached in dimension context.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall texture and detail of the sandwich been preserved despite the addition of the holographic screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, aside from the holographic screen's presence, the sandwich retains its original texture and detail. The contents, bread texture, and knife remain unchanged and clearly visible, indicating the editing did not alter these details.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background remain consistent and undistorted by the addition of the holographic projection screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B remains undisturbed with the presence of the holographic screen. There are no distortions or inconsistencies detectable in the paper wrapping or underlying surface, which maintain their original appearance unaffected by the holographic addition.",
