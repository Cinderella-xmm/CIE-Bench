      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the fairy have consistent transparency, smooth surface curvature, and realistic reflections without visible artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to have a smooth curvature, as indicated by the uniform shape and the reflections consistent with a polished glass surface. The transparency is even, with no noticeable distortion or jagged edges along its structure. This assessment is derived from observing the clean lines and reflections on the glass that match expectations for a high-quality glass dome.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wooden base beneath the fairy rendered with realistic wood grain patterns, consistent shading, and no artificial or distorted surface features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base appears to have well-rendered wood grain patterns that are expected in a high-quality wooden surface. The shading is consistent throughout the base, contributing to a realistic depiction without any visible distortion or artificial elements. This conclusion is based on the visual observation of the texture and color distribution that aligns with real wood characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings' metallic surfaces evenly lit with subtle highlights and reflections, maintaining intact venation patterns and no visible texture repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic surfaces of the butterfly wings in Image B are evenly lit, with highlights and reflections that suggest a metallic quality. The venation patterns are intact, which underscores the realistic representation. There are no signs of texture repetition or distortion, providing a seamless appearance consistent with a high-fidelity rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the fabric textures on the fairyâ€™s outfit appear detailed and continuous, with no abrupt transitions, blurring, or inconsistencies in thread patterns or material thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric textures on the fairy's outfit in Image B look detailed and continuous, as evidenced by the clear thread patterns and consistent material thickness visible across the outfit. There are no abrupt transitions or blurring effects, suggesting a high level of detail and realistic texturing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floating petals and leaves positioned at varying depths with soft edges and translucent qualities, showing no overlapping errors, sharpness mismatches, or unnatural placement relative to the fairy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floating petals and leaves are positioned with varying depths, which is suggested by their differentiation in size and focus. They exhibit soft edges and seem to have a degree of translucency, indicative of a realistic portrayal. There are no visible overlapping errors or sharpness mismatches, and their placement relative to the fairy appears natural, reflecting thoughtful composition.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the blue gradient background smoothly transitioned without visible color bands, pixelation, or irregularities in tone distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue gradient background in Image B transitions smoothly, without any visible color bands or pixelation. The tone distribution appears to be even, consistent with a high-quality gradient. This assessment is based on the absence of artifacts that typically indicate a poorly rendered gradient.",
