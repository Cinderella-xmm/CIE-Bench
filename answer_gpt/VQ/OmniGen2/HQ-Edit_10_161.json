      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the dress can be seen as maintaining their continuity and alignment. The shapes are clear and well-defined without any noticeable distortion or broken edges. This conclusion is drawn by observing the dress, where each pattern segment fits logically with the others, maintaining the overall design without any visible misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklaces do not appear as flat or transparent stained glass tiles; instead, they maintain a consistent, realistic texture that is typical of beads. There are no signs of flat tile-like structures or unusual color gradients commonly associated with stained glass. The beads appear rounded and detailed, countering the notion of jagged or pixelated edges.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the braids remain distinct and proportionally accurate. Each braid is individually identifiable, maintaining smooth transitions and clear separations between segments, without any signs of collapsing or fusing. The connections between bead segments appear smooth, showing detailed and careful editing work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background portrays a stylized stained glass effect, which is inherently different from natural terrain. It features colorful, uniform patches that blend in a manner typical of stained glass artwork, lacking the varied textures and elevation changes of natural landscapes. The use of vivid colors and uniform design is artistically intentional, reflecting a non-natural aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the bracelets on both arms are symmetrically positioned and correctly numbered without distortion. They maintain their natural appearance without any signs of stretching, overlapping, or other formatting errors. The symmetry and the correct count provide confirmation of precise editing.",
