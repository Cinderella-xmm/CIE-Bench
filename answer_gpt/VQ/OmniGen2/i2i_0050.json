      "question": "If motion trajectory lines were added around the horse, would they appear naturally integrated with the environment without disrupting the image's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is grazing calmly on a sandy and grassy area near the water. The setting is serene and natural, with a clear separation between the foreground and background elements. Adding motion trajectory lines around the horse might not fit the tranquil and still environment naturally. The lines could disrupt the impression of the horse's static position and the natural ambiance, thus altering the authenticity of the image.",

      "question": "If a skater was added near the house in the background, would the scale and perspective match the existing scene correctly, maintaining structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house in the background is set at a considerable distance from the camera. To maintain structural consistency, any added skater near the house should be aligned in proportion to the house's size and perspective from the camera's viewpoint. Given that the house appears quite small due to the distance, a skater would likely appear disproportionate and disconnected from the scene's natural perspective, making it difficult to merge seamlessly without issues in scale.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "If the skater's three motion phases were imposed over the sea and land, would the transitions between these phases look smooth without introducing artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the natural setting includes water and sand, each with distinct textures and movement patterns. Imposing three motion phases could introduce discordant elements that clash with the calm sea and static land textures. The key issue would be maintaining smooth transitions between phases without causing visual breakage or texture irregularity, which seems unlikely to achieve given the complexity of blending dynamic phases with static elements smoothly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Would the details of the horse's fur texture and the surrounding grass remain visually coherent and undistorted after adding the skater's motion trajectory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's fur texture and surrounding grass are detailed and consistent with the natural environment. Adding motion trajectory could potentially add distracting elements that interfere with these details, causing distortion or incoherence in texture continuity. Such alterations might divert the focus from the horse and grass details, leading to visual dissonance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "If the skater's starting motion frames were placed in this scenic setting, would the composition maintain balance and coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a quiet and pastoral scene where elements like the horse and natural background are harmoniously integrated. Introducing skater motion frames would likely change the visual balance by adding movement to an otherwise static image. The starting frames could interrupt the tranquility and seem out of context within the serene setting, disrupting coherence.",
