    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is illustrated with exaggerated Zig-zag motion lines, a common technique in illustrations to imply movement. However, these lines are not actual parts of the anatomy. The limbs still follow a typical human structure without unnatural bends or distortions at the joints. The joints, elbows, and knees are articulated in a way that mirrors human flexibility, even within the constraints of an illustrated spacesuit. Given this, the limbs maintain proportions consistent with human anatomy, avoiding bizarre or unrealistic postures despite the stylized design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The celestial motifs on the suit in Image B are consistent and uniform. Illustrations often simplify textures to match the style, and in this case, the texture aligns well with the stylized look of the imitation spacesuit. There are no visible seams or artifacts disrupting the thematic illustrations, indicating a deliberate design rather than practical functionality. The artistic consistency and the lack of unexpected artifacts confirm that these motifs blend well with the intended material appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the moon surface is illustrated with a simplified design. The surface lines and the astronaut's feet are correctly aligned, with shadows positioned where the feet meet the surface, maintaining proper depth perception within artistic conventions. Illustrations often use symbolic rather than literal depth representation, yet the absence of misalignment or gaps in this context confirms the depth and scale appropriateness. The artistic cohesion is evident, particularly as the scene is presented on a single plane with consistent alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The face in Image B is intentionally blurred, as per the instruction to exclude it from consideration. Thus, analysis of facial proportions and feature alignments is not applicable based on the image content, and the structured query is answered considering the absence of evaluative content.",
    "answer": "N/A"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the space-themed border is well-aligned along the edge of the image. It neither overlaps nor cuts into the primary elements, like the astronaut or background. The border's consistent pattern and alignment contribute to the balanced framing of the composition. Similarly, the card stock texture is simulated in a manner that ensures uniformity across the entire piece. There is no visible texture repetition that might detract from the smooth, cohesive appearance, indicating careful design application to maintain aesthetic integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
