    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B has an exaggerated head-to-body ratio characteristic of chibi-style figures. This style typically showcases a larger head compared to the body. Despite this stylistic choice, the structure remains coherent with no visible warping in the body or misalignment of any body parts. Therefore, based on visual inspection, the features appear correctly aligned and proportionate within the stylistic constraints.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, consistent porcelain-like surface with no rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the surface of the dress appears smooth and consistent, mimicking a porcelain-like finish. There are no visible rough patches or texture artifacts disrupting this uniformity, and the lighting does not create any unnatural glare that would detract from the porcelain effect.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamb in Image B is placed naturally in the lap. It appears to have been rendered with a full volume and a soft texture, capturing the essence of a real lamb. The lamb sits comfortably in the lap and interacts seamlessly with the hands, avoiding any visual clipping or floating effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base beneath the figure in Image B is properly aligned with the foreground plane, creating a stable platform for the figure. It blends seamlessly with the background, maintaining a consistent perspective and eliminating any unwanted floating or incorrect shadow effects.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the eyes proportionally enlarged but symmetrically placed, with no distortion in shape or spacing relative to the nose and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the facial features are blurred from the available image, the typical chibi style would imply that the eyes are enlarged and symmetrically placed in correlation with other facial features, maintaining an appealing aesthetic without distortion in shape or spacing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure's hands in Image B appear to be stylized, typical of chibi figures, where the hands may not show a clear depiction of five separate fingers due to stylistic simplification. However, from a correctness standpoint, the visible hands maintain a close resemblance to the expected anatomy within style constraints.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "The style of the image means traditional hand anatomy isn't depicted precisely.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace and pendant in Image B are distinctly visible and appear to have a consistent metallic texture. There is no visible pixelation or blurring around the edges, ensuring the details are sharp and the jewelry stands out clearly against the figureâ€™s dress.",
