      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each teddy bear is covered in mosaic tiles that appear to be distributed evenly across their surface. The tiles are consistent in both size and alignment, creating a seamless appearance without visible gaps or misaligned edges. This suggests meticulous attention to detail in the mosaic application process, ensuring uniformity throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tile patterns on the sweaters closely conform to the natural shape and contour of each garment. The original spherical and cylindrical shapes are preserved without any noticeable warping, and the geometric shapes are intact. This indicates that the tile application successfully captured the original design of the sweaters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the teddy bears are articulated using mosaic tiles that effectively define the eyes, noses, and mouths. These features are placed proportionately according to standard teddy bear design, and they remain distinct without any blurring or misalignment that could obscure recognition. This points to well-executed tile placement prioritizing clarity in facial expressions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows on the teddy bears maintain their original shape and are depicted with tiles that have a smooth, reflective surface. This contrasts effectively with the less reflective mosaic tiles simulating fur, allowing the bows to stand out. The reflective quality suggests intentional design to differentiate the texture and appearance of the bows from the fur.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white pedestal appears fully grounded beneath the teddy bears, with no visible gaps that might suggest a floating effect. The edges of the pedestal are clean and sharp, and it retains a uniform color without any blending issues or distortion in tone. This indicates that the pedestal is well-integrated into the scene.",
