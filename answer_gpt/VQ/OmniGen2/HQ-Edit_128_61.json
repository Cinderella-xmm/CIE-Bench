      "question": "Does the transformed tagine retain its original conical shape and base proportions, with no visible warping or deformation in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tagine has been transformed into an ornate lamp similar to Aladdin's lamp. The original conical shape of the tagine with a flat base has been replaced by a rounded, ornate shape with a spout and handle. Thus, it does not retain the original shape or base proportions from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arabesque patterns and gem-like details on the tagine's surface evenly rendered with consistent texture, lighting response, and material properties, without any visible seams or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the lamp features intricate arabesque patterns and gem-like details. These elements are rendered (perhaps through digital means) with high consistency in texture and lighting, exhibiting a seamless integration with no visible imperfections in highlights or seams, conveying a realistic portrayal of luxurious material properties.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the smoke emerging from the tagine smooth, translucent, and flowing naturally, with a clearly defined but soft-edged genie silhouette that does not exhibit jagged lines or digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke is emerging from the lamp, not a tagine. The smoke is designed to be smooth, translucent, and flows naturally with a soft, swirling genie-like silhouette. There are no observable jagged edges or digital artifacts, and the transition of the smoke into the ambient space is seamless.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic threads and jewel-like elements on the fabric appear embedded within the textile weave, with realistic reflection and shadowing that matches the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the ornate lamp and the jewel-like elements present on the lamp's design, not the fabric of Image A. These jewels on the lamp are integrated into the design with realistic reflections and shadows, enhancing the ornate quality without the context of fabric textile weave.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the tagine and the smoke consistent with the light source direction, and do they properly interact with the fabric and surrounding environment without floating or misplaced areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp casts shadows that align with a consistent light source direction, likely imagined to be from above or slightly above-front. The shadows and reflections from the lamp and smoke interact appropriately with the surface it sits upon, though details of environmental interaction like fabric aren't explicitly shown.",
