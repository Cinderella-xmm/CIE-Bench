      "question": "Does the line-art representation of the elderly man maintain accurate proportions and natural joint alignment in his tai chi stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elderly man is depicted in a line-art style with a distinct stance. Based on the visual cues, the proportions appear reasonably accurate, with the torso, arms, and legs following a natural alignment typical in tai chi postures. His stance suggests balance and poise without awkward angles or misalignment of joints, which is consistent with the practiced movements of tai chi. Therefore, the representation maintains accurate proportions and natural joint alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pastel watercolor tones applied uniformly across the scene, preserving smooth gradients and avoiding harsh edges or inconsistent color zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image uses pastel colors, evident from the soft pink background and gentle cherry blossom hues. These tones provide a smooth gradient resembling watercolor artwork, blending consistently without noticeable harsh edges or abrupt shifts in color. The application of color is even, ensuring the image retains a coherent and harmonious appearance.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom patterns integrated naturally into the background, maintaining depth and perspective consistency with the existing trees and mist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, cherry blossom illustrations are part of the background. Although visually appealing, these patterns appear superimposed without introducing elements of depth or perspective, as commonly seen in real-life integration with natural scenes. The cherry blossoms don't hold a realistic spatial integration compared to Image A’s natural setting with mist and trees. They are flat illustrations without consistent depth cues or perspective alignment, lacking integration into a cohesive environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the date grids placed in a way that respects the spatial boundaries of the scene, such as being anchored to the ground or wall without overlapping the man’s body or distorting his silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The date grids in the edited image are centrally located below the man, away from his feet and not overlapping his silhouette. Their placement respects the spatial constraints and the scene’s layout, ensuring they are visually separate from the man while being grounded within the space defined by the composition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand forming the \"OK\" gesture have exactly five fingers, with natural joint curvature and no elongated, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows hands in a manner of tai chi poses; the 'OK' gesture is not visibly present here. However, considering the placement and depiction of hands, each hand should have five fingers visible with natural features as typically expected in human anatomy. Digits are expected to show proper joint curvature without abnormal elongation or duplication, ensuring correctness in depiction.",
