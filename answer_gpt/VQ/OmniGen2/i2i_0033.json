      "question": "Does the person retain a natural jumping pose that aligns with typical human biomechanics, avoiding any distortion or unnatural posturing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted in a dynamic pose that resembles a typical jumping motion. The body's posture, with bent knees and the alignment of the arms, suggests a motion commonly seen in athletic or energetic jumping poses. Based on the visual cues and understanding of human motion, the jumping pose appears to be natural and consistent with human biomechanics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines applied to the person and surrounding elements smooth and continuous, without any jagged edges or breaks that would disrupt the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline style is bold and consistent, characteristic of a hand-drawn or graffiti-inspired illustration. The lines around the figure and text appear smooth and unbroken, maintaining a coherent visual flow and enhancing the strength of the graphic presentation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background blend the graffiti and concrete texture effectively, creating an authentic look without overlapping issues or blending that obscures either element's distinct characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of Image B integrates a bold graphic style typical of graffiti with strong textual elements. However, there are no visible texture overlaps or confusion between elements, as the focus is clearly on the graphic text and figure. The composition keeps these elements distinct by not trying to blend concrete textures, making the overall presentation clear and stylish.",

      "question": "Has the individual's face been preserved authentically within the new artistic style, retaining identifiable features like the eyes, nose, and mouth without distortion or excessive simplification?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question instructs to not reflect on the blurred face, thus comparison or analysis of facial features is irrelevant and not applicable here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details and patterns on the suit, tie, and shirt remain discernible within the hand-drawn style, avoiding any unnatural smudging or loss of defining characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit, tie, and shirt are depicted with clear lines and patterns, effectively translating the design elements into the hand-drawn style. The details such as the checkered pattern on the suit and the intricate design on the tie remain visible and are not lost, maintaining the integrity of the clothing details.",
