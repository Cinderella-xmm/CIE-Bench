    "Question": "Q1: Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage travel case has clear boundaries with metallic corners and clasps that are well-integrated into the scene. The perspective is consistent, and the lighting across the case does not shift abruptly, maintaining a coherent visual flow with the objects inside.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
    "explanation": "The resin grass in Image B has blades that show variation in length and angle, mimicking natural grass. The shadows cast by the blades are soft and align with the light source direction from above, resulting in consistent lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "In the diorama (Image B), the acacia tree is considerably smaller than the elephant, and its placement suggests a depth that provides a believable sense of scale. The perspective within the case gives the impression of depth and distance, which helps frame the scene appropriately within the confined space of the box.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
    "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are painted onto the inner surface of the lid and do not appear to have depth that suggests floating. They lack any specular highlights that would imply depth or inconsistency, which keeps the perspective of the painted diorama intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
    "explanation": "The brass compass in Image B is positioned flat on the grass surface, reflecting light in a way that matches both the lighting direction and the surface texture. The reflected light and shadows are consistent with a single overhead light source, which supports its realistic integration into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The elephant figure in Image B maintains realistic skin textures and anatomically correct limb proportions. Its tusks are curved naturally, without signs of deformation or pixelation, ensuring that the miniature remains faithful to the real appearance of an elephant.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all objects, including the elephant, compass, and miniature tree, cast shadows in the same direction, indicative of consistent lighting from a single overhead source. The softness of the shadows aligns across the scene, reinforcing the realism of the diorama setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
