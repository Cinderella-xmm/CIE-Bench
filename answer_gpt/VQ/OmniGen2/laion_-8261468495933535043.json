      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tessellated tiles that form the sausages have a consistent elongated, curved shape that suggests a strategic and careful placement of individual tiles. These tiles mimic the natural curvature of sausages, which are elongated and rounded at the ends. The mosaic pattern is applied smoothly without evident distortions or abrupt angles that would suggest unnatural straightening. By analyzing the visual cues and using knowledge of typical sausage shapes, it can be concluded that the form is maintained without geometric distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green-tiled areas in Image B are crafted to imitate the irregular, ruffled edges and layered texture characteristic of lettuce leaves. Each tile's placement contributes to an overall effect of organic and natural flow. The edges are not strictly uniform or blocky, which suggests an intention to create a more lifelike representation of lettuce. This analysis is supported by recognizing that lettuce generally has a loose, varied structure that is not typically manifested in a rigid or blocky pattern.",

      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the formation of the egg tiles is perfectly circular, adhering to a regular geometric outline. The orange-yellow yolk tile is centered and proportionally similar to how a typical fried egg yolk would appear within the surrounding white. By inspecting the layout and using knowledge of common egg proportions where the yolk is roughly central within an oval or circular area, one can confirm that the image maintains these recognized proportions and orientation.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic elements (sausages, salad, eggs) appear to be arranged with careful attention to balance and symmetry across the circular plate. The sausages, eggs, and leaves are spaced to create an aesthetically pleasing and evenly distributed pattern. Given this symmetry and equal spacing, each section appears proportional, maintaining balanced visual weighting. By understanding that a symmetrical setup involves equal spacing and harmoniously sized elements about a central point, it can be confirmed that the placement achieves this.",

      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass tiles in Image B display uniform edge definitions, implying precision in their cut and placement. Each tile shows subtle reflection effects characteristic of glass surfaces and consistent color shading across its surface area. Noticeably, there are no jagged lines, blurring, or artifacts which would indicate poor quality or execution in the tile design. This detailed observation, along with knowledge of mosaic art techniques to achieve clean and consistent aesthetics, supports the conclusion that the tiles exhibit these refined qualities.",
