      "question": "Does the 3D voxel-style model of the mouse retain a natural texture similar to the original mouse's fur without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse exhibits a smooth and polished appearance with a uniform texture, characteristic of digital rendering, which differs from the natural fur texture seen in Image A. In Image A, the fur appears soft and detailed, reflecting light in various directions as expected with real fur. The second image lacks these intricate variations in texture seen in a natural setting, suggesting a more artificial, computer-generated texture fidelity, despite its precision.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the mouse's body parts in the 3D voxel-style model consistent with its original form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the mouse body appears well-proportioned relative to common real-life mouse anatomy, similar to Image A. Features such as the size and placement of the eyes, ears, limbs, and overall stance are faithfully represented, maintaining accurate proportions without noticeable distortion or deformation, indicative of careful digital design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the edges and surfaces of the 3D voxel-style mouse model appear smooth and coherent, without any jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a mouse where the lines and curves forming the mouse's body are smoothly rendered, with no visible jagged edges or pixelation, suggesting a high-quality digital modeling process. This consistent and coherent surface contrasts with potential issues in lower fidelity models but aligns well with the smooth natural curves seen in Image A's real mouse.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the 3D voxel-style mouse model and the smartphone look plausible and realistic, without any unnatural positioning or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position and shadows of the mouse relative to the smartphone appear naturally integrated. The overall layout on the uniform-colored surface suggests a thoughtful consideration of spatial dynamics and lighting. The interaction mimics a plausible natural scene as seen in Image A, where real-life positioning and shading would occur naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the mouse's features, such as whiskers and eyes, preserved in the 3D voxel-style model without any loss or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, notable features such as the eyes and whiskers are prominently defined with clear precision, similar to Image A. The eyes are well-positioned and proportioned, and the whiskers are distinctly apparent without blending into the background. This maintains a high level of detail without degradation of these fine features, characteristic of proficient 3D modeling.",
