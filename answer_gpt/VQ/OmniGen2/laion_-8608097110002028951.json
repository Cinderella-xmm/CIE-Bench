      "question": "Does the facade of the theater building appear composed of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents, without visible seams, irregular patterns, or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the theater building shows a bright yellowish color with distinct brick patterns, enhancing the contrast and visibility of architectural details compared to more natural textures you'd expect from real LEGO bricks which are smooth and uniform. LEGO bricks usually have visible seams, especially where bricks connect, whereas the image shows a facade with a consistent color and texture. The brown accents appear integrated into a natural architectural style rather than being separate, uniform LEGO pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes that preserve the arch shape but feature a regular grid pattern, without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three arched windows retain their original arch shape and feature a grid pattern. Though this grid could resemble a LEGO pane, LEFO panes would be much more explicit with evenly fashioned interlocking connections. The visibility of the distinct, colored glass effects with varying transparency levels suggests windows, which cannot be solely attributed to LEGO styling.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" signs show letters constructed from smooth red flat LEGO bricks, maintaining legibility and alignment with the awning structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the signs display text in what appears to continue as flat surfaces, not displaying clear interlocked bricks. LEGO signs would typically show separations between bricks and project a more modular appearance. The text in Image B looks naturally fitted onto the awning surface rather than built from recognizable individual LEGO pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles with simplified shapes, including rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces, without retaining realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage cars are depicted with exaggerated colors but retain realistic car features such as curved fenders, and detailed designs consistent with those of authentic vintage vehicles. LEGO cars typically have a more angular, simplified look with cubical shapes and minimal curves. The cars appear to emphasize detail rather than the blockiness associated with LEGO creations.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-style cars and building maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment, with no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the colors and texture of the cars and building have been brightened and altered, the overall scale and alignment of Image B are consistent. Realistic alignment is preserved, suggesting transitions in color and not rendering them in a different, more disconnected style that LEGO structuring might involve. Therefore, overall size proportion and alignment are not consistent with LEGO styling.",
