      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face of the 3D character appears to be intentionally blurred, which prevents the assessment of facial details and proportions. Therefore, the possibility of unnatural distortions or artifacts cannot be evaluated based on the given visual information.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D character has exaggerated and stylized proportions typical of a chibi design, featuring long legs and a smaller torso. This is a common characteristic of chibi art styles, where proportions are intentionally unrealistic but should still appear coherent within the artistic style. The character appears visually balanced and structurally coherent without visible unnatural geometric distortions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D character's outfit mirrors the colors from Image A, utilizing a green bottom and burnt orange top.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D character is depicted with various accessories, such as glasses, a tablet or sketchbook, and footwear.

      "explanation": "In Image B, the solid yellow background complements the character's attire by providing a warm, neutral canvas that accentuates the green and orange hues without causing distraction. The consistent background enhances focus on the character, and no distracting artifacts are noticeable, making the setting visually appealing.",
