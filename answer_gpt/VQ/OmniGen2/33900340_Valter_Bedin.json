    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archways are intact and maintain their original geometric structure, matching what we'd expect for arches in a tower. Through visual inspection, no signs are evident that indicate they have been reshaped into limbs or contain unnatural transitions. Hence, the arches retain their symmetrical and well-defined structure without morphological alterations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no glowing glyphs apparent on the stone surface. The masonry retains the texture of the original stone and does not display digital artifacts, jagged edges, or abrupt color shifts. The stone wall texture is consistent with the style of the stonework typical of such historic architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a green glow surrounding the central figures creates a mystical aura. However, the visual transition between the darker shadowed area and this aura is abrupt rather than gradual, as the aura is highly luminous compared to the shadows. The glow tracks sharply rather than continuously, hence the transition lacks a subtle gradient.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and B, the luminous guide wisp in Image B indeed overlaps the position where the original figure and dog were situated. The wisp is proportionally large compared to the previous figures, and while it seems to maintain the spatial alignment, it exhibits a solid texture with distinct edges rather than a wispy translucent appearance. The transformation lacks a suitably ethereal effect.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem appears to be spatially configured to represent standing within the battleground area. The architectural structure around creates an enclosed space, giving depth perception, allowing the golem to seem grounded rather than floating away or behind. This matches typical depth layering principles within a visual composition.",
