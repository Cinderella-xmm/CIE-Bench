      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the crystal facets appear to be carefully crafted to mimic the shape and alignment of the panel lines seen in conventional vehicles, which are typically straight and uniform. The facets exhibit a high level of craftsmanship, ensuring that the shapes align seamlessly with each panel line without visible breaks or misaligned edges. The construction mirrors typical engineering precision, consistent with luxury materials like crystal. Comparing this with Image A, where the vehicle's panel lines are smooth and cohesive, Image B replicates these characteristics with its crystal material, reflecting proper alignment and uniformity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quartz wheels are designed to replicate the physical dimensions and alignment of the original wheels, including spacing and axle positioning, as found in standard vehicle construction. The crystal wheels convincingly maintain these proportions, matching the structure seen in Image A. The quartz material is well-integrated into the design without anomalies such as floating or misplacement, reflecting the original engineering of the truck's wheel system.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quartz wheels exhibit detailed internal structures that resemble natural crystal lattice formations, which are typically smooth and consistent. These formations adhere to the shape of the hubs and rims as seen in Image A, maintaining the vehicle's circular geometry. In contrast to rudimentary construction, the presence of uniform lattice patterns implies high-level artistry and precision without jagged or inconsistent lines, closely reflecting natural crystal formations.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a white marble platform that provides a continuous base for the crystal truck. As supporting structures are designed to be flat and continuous for stability, this platform properly supports the truck from end to end. Observations show no gaps or sections where parts of the vehicle appear to float, suggesting a sound and complete platform design. This logical inference of flat and continuous support mirrors the foundational features necessary for stability.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows crystal surfaces that possess the expected properties of high-quality emerald and jade, which involve subtle color refraction and soft reflections rather than dull appearance or exaggerations. The smooth reflections and healthy translucence adhere to the material qualities present in such gemstones without unnatural glowing patches or chromatic aberrations, which would imply poor material representation or editing artifacts. The aesthetic and realistic quality suggests proper reflection and refraction control.",
