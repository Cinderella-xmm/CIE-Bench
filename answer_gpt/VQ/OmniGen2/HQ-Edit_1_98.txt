    "Question": "Q1: Does the floral engraving on the dress appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric without visible texture breaks, misaligned patterns, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral engraving on the dress should visually appear part of the fabric, meaning it aligns with the dress's texture and contours without causing any disruption in the fabric's flow. From the visual cues, the floral patterns integrate well with the overall design of the dress. The highlights or shadows should mimic natural lighting on fabric. Here, the engraving appears natural without any evident misalignments or texture issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the sepia tones applied uniformly across all elements (including skin, dress, violin, window frame, and plants) without localized color distortions or loss of detail in shadows or highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a sepia tone meant to give a vintage or classic look to all included elements. A uniform application would mean that there are no abrupt changes in color saturation or hue across different objects such as the skin, dress, violin, window, and plants. In analyzing Image B, the sepia tones appear consistently applied without unusual color shifts or loss of detail, maintaining visual coherence throughout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the abstract swirls in the window view remain confined within the window panes and align correctly with their borders, without overlapping into the room or distorting the window structure?",
    "explanation": "The abstract swirls should visually stay within the bounds of the window panes. In Image B, the swirls align well with the window frame, maintaining their position within the panes. They do not encroach into the interior space of the room or affect the structural integrity of the window by crossing into unwanted areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the gold inlays on the violin positioned along logical contours of the instrument and do they exhibit consistent metallic sheen and reflection without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "Gold inlay placement should logically correspond to areas on the violin where embellishments are normally placed, such as edges or around feature points of the instrument. The reflection and sheen should mimic metal, staying consistent in how light and shadow play on them. In Image B, the gold inlays are placed logically, following the violin's contours, and the metallic sheen is consistently applied.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the handwritten music score border evenly spaced, legible, and aligned along the image edge without intersecting or obscuring any part of the violinist, window, or foreground objects?",
    "explanation": "The music score border should frame the bottom part of the image without interfering with central elements like the violinist or foreground. In Image B, the border is even, does not obscure any central component of the image, and aligns well with the edges, complementing the overall composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
