    "Question": "Q1: Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a crystal vase with faceted surfaces and a distinct, angular texture while Image A shows a rounded ceramic vase. In Image B, the vase does not replicate the ornate shape or proportions of the original ceramic vase. The crystal vase is structured with sharp edges and more geometric forms, contrasting with the smooth and decorated surface of the ceramic vase. Thus, the crystal vase does not retain the original shape and proportions.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase does not show any floral patterns etched into its surface. Instead, the design consists of sharp facets without any additional patterns. In contrast, Image A features decorative floral patterns painted onto the ceramic surface with clarity and detail. Hence, the abstract floral patterns are neither etched nor present on Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
    "explanation": "The crystal flowers in Image B hold recognizable shapes similar to typical blooms and display pastel colors with translucent qualities, suggesting internal refraction. When examined, these flowers avoid solid or opaque appearances, maintaining a realistic look by allowing light to pass through them, emphasizing the internal glow. Image A contains real flowers, distinct in variety and natural colors. The clarity and refraction in Image B effectively mimic the original bloom appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a flat pedestal where the reflection is not directly visible due to the absence of clear reflections beneath the crystal vase. It appears as a solid base without distinct reflections. In Image A, the ornate table surface does not provide a mirrored effect either. Therefore, Image B's pedestal does not provide an undistorted reflection.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal elements are illuminated to achieve realistic lighting effects, demonstrating refraction and internal glow in hand with soft highlights. The facets of the vase and flowers enhance the light play without producing exaggerated bright spots or lacking depth, unlike Image A, which showcases real flower arrangements under softer, diffused lighting. Thus, the conditions in Image B conform to realistic refraction and lighting effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
