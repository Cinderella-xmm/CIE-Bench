    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case appears to have smooth edges and proper transparency, which is evident by the clear visibility of the objects inside. The edges look properly aligned and there are no visual cues of floating or misaligned sections. This suggests the intended realism for a miniature showcase.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carâ€™s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car with metallic red coloring that is consistently applied across the surface. The gradients between the highlights and shadows on the car seem smooth and natural. The detail lines along the body panels are sharp, maintaining the realistic design of a high-end sports car.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road and cliff areas have a sense of depth and transparency. The colors transition gradually indicating varying layers of resin, avoiding a flat appearance. These areas appear distinct due to the visual cues of depth provided by their texture and transparency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the micro gravel texture on the surfaces displays an even distribution with natural variations in size. There are no apparent patterns or repetitive elements that would make the texture look artificial, suggesting careful attention to realistic detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset sky panel blends seamlessly with the original sky background. The color gradients are consistent with no visible seams or clipping, maintaining a natural horizon alignment. This reflects a coherent integration of elements in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car, road, cliffs, and display case in proportions that suggest a miniature scale. The relationship between the size of the car and the road, along with the cliffs and display case, does not appear exaggerated and fits the expected proportions for a display model.",
