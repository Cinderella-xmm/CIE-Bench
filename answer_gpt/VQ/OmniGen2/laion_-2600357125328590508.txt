    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sock’s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sock is presented with a clear shape and structured design that suggests uniform and proportional alignment. The sock shows no signs of distortion or stretched geometry, indicating that any representation within the sock's design, whether real or imagined, maintains its original proportions. Hence, visually there wouldn’t be any warped or stretched geometry given the smooth and consistent contours seen in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a sock that appears smooth and consistent in its design. The graphics do not reveal any gaps or misaligned layers; instead, they follow the sock's contours accurately. The creation of a cohesive 3D structure is evident as the sock's texture and graphics smoothly overlay the sock's form, suggesting any use of elemental layering would naturally follow the sock's curves without misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the 'UNO' text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the sock, including the 'UNO' text and accent stripes, align well with its color scheme of black, gray, and white. These colors are consistently applied throughout the sock's design, matching the original layout and maintaining consistency throughout. Any imagined application of LEGO bricks within this context would equally align with these color arrangements without indicating any visual inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orange piece is visibly located at the top of the sock cuff, appearing securely attached as it features a clear integration with the cuff’s design. The positioning is logical, complementing the overall sock structure without visible indicators of floating or awkward attachment. The strong juxtaposition between the piece and the cuff suggests an intended integration without any anomaly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the sock against a neutral, plain background with adequate lighting that accentuates its form and design. The presentation ensures that shadows and reflections remain minimal and natural, effectively showcasing the sock's design and shape without distracting elements. This portrayal emphasizes its 3D characteristics while maintaining a balanced visual appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
