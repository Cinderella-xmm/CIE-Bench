      "question": "Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser body is constructed using LEGO bricks, which typically are consistent in spacing and alignment due to their interlocking design. Observing the surface texture of the dresser body, there are no visible gaps or irregularities noticeable, as the bricks appear to be consistently aligned across the surface. In general, LEGO bricks provide a uniformity that helps avoid gaps, assuming they are correctly assembled.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front panels are constructed using LEGO bricks; however, the precise herringbone pattern seen in marquetry might be challenging to replicate using LEGO. The surface seems to lack the intricate definition typical of marquetry patterns, indicating that the herringbone effect may not be continuous due to the limitations of LEGO piece placement, resulting in a possible absence of detailed continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold decorative borders in Image B appear to be recreated with LEGO bricks, which often result in more angular shapes due to their block-like nature. Observing the borders, they seem to maintain the general curve and contour of the design but might still have sharper angles and breaks in some flow areas due to the inherent construction limitations of LEGO bricks compared to the smoothness seen in traditional furniture detailing.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side panels and cabriole legs are constructed using LEGO bricks. While the intention is to mimic the smooth curve of these features, LEGO's nature makes it difficult to achieve entirely smooth transitions. There might be visible steps or angular breaks where bricks meet, as achieving a smooth, uninterrupted curve is challenging in LEGO builds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the gray LEGO tile top in Image B, it should sit flat and level due to the inherent design of LEGO tiles which typically ensure a consistent fit when placed accurately. The edges appear clean, and there are no visible gaps or misalignments observed where the top meets the dresser sides, indicating a proper and level fit.",
