      "question": "Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sofa with plush cloud-like textures appearing on the seat, backrest, and armrests. The clouds are depicted with a soft, fluffy appearance, exhibiting a layered form that mimics real clouds. This indicates a smooth texture without flat or blocky regions, suggesting a continuous, fluffy look typical of cloud formations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden frame and legs are intact and not replaced with wind-like structures. They maintain their rigid, straight form with no indication of flowing or fluid motion. This contrasts the cloud texture above, keeping a solid and angular appearance typical of wooden furniture.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features eyes integrated into the cloud texture of the upper cushions. These eyes appear to be smoothly incorporated into the clouds without jagged edges or color contrasts that would disrupt the continuity of the texture. The eye design maintains the soft aesthetic that matches the clouds surrounding it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a mist trail extends from the back of the sofa. The trail is depicted as continuous with a consistent texture and fading intensity, blending naturally into the sky backdrop. There are no visible breaks or unnatural boundaries, providing a seamless transition typical of mist in open air.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the structural integrity of the sofa, with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base. The transition from wooden base to fluffy cloud top does not introduce gaps or overlap, and there are no distortions affecting the geometric stability, preserving the overall form better seen in traditional sofa designs.",
