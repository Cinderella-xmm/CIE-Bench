    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings formed from the branches have smooth, continuous outlines without visible breaks, warping, or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings are designed with a smooth and continuous outline, indicating a well-rendered structure without breaks or misalignment. World knowledge suggests that artistic representations of wings aim for aesthetic continuity, which is successfully achieved here.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent patterns on the butterfly wings evenly distributed with soft edges and no visible digital artifacts like halos or sharp contrast jumps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent patterns on the wings in Image B appear to be evenly distributed with soft transitions between colors and light points, resembling high-quality digital artwork that avoids common artifacts such as halos or harsh contrasts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing eyes and antlers positioned in a way that respects the original branching structure, with no unnatural overlaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antlers in Image B are integrated into the design, appearing natural and respecting the branching structure without floating or overlapping in an unrealistic manner. This demonstrates a thoughtful design that maintains harmony with the figure's form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stone base retain natural stone texture, including subtle variations in color and surface depth, without appearing uniformly flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone base displays variations in texture and color, suggesting a realistic rendering of stone that includes depth and surface irregularities as would be expected from natural materials.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark-like textures on the trunk flow continuously along its contours without sudden breaks, unnatural ridges, or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trunk textures in Image B visually mimic a natural bark effect, flowing along the contours smoothly without any abrupt breaks or inconsistencies. This reflects an organic design coherence in the depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the remaining leaves, soil, and root structures clearly visible and undistorted, with no blurring, loss of edge definition, or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves, soil, and roots have undergone a transformation into a cohesive artistic display, retaining clarity without evident distortion or blurring, indicating a high-quality representation with attention to detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements cast subtle ambient light on nearby surfaces, and do shadows from the wings, eyes, and antlers align with the sceneâ€™s lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the glowing elements creating ambient lighting effects that subtly enhance nearby surfaces, with shadowing that aligns well with the lighting direction, suggesting a well-considered interplay between light and shadow.",
