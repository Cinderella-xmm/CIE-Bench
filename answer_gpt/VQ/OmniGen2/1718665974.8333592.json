      "question": "Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass gears and leather armor pieces in the edited image appear well-crafted with precise alignment and realistic metallic textures. The shapes are consistent, and the elements fit together seamlessly, indicating attention to detail in the design. There are no visible gaps or misaligned edges, suggesting a coherent and aesthetically pleasing assembly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clockwork wings are symmetrically positioned on either side of the character, with well-defined and structurally coherent mechanical joints and gear patterns. These features are designed to follow logical engineering principles, with no indications of warped or broken geometry, suggesting a cohesive and functional design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face integrated into the glowing orb is clearly visible and properly scaled. It emits light that is consistent with the surrounding glow, and there are no distortions in the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils. The design ensures that the clock face fits seamlessly within the overall aesthetic, maintaining balance and coherence.",

      "question": "Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background cityscape is detailed, with brass towers and airships positioned in a spatially plausible manner. The lighting and shadowing are consistent and align with the sepia tone theme of the image. There are no floating or disconnected elements, ensuring a cohesive and realistic scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia tone is applied uniformly across the image, enhancing the aesthetic while maintaining the visibility of details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background. The tone does not cause fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas, preserving the image's clarity and depth.",
