      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls maintain the recognizable shape and proportions of the giraffe without introducing unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are designed with a whimsical element, incorporating giraffe features. The largest doll has a giraffe head, which maintains a recognizable shape without any geometric distortions. Russian nesting dolls typically have a consistent shape being round and stacked from largest to smallest. The design integrates a giraffe-themed top without distorting overall doll shapes, keeping the proportions recognizable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the Russian nesting dolls consistent with the giraffe's fur pattern, avoiding unnatural or overly smooth surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B primarily feature smooth surfaces typical of such dolls, with painted patterns. The dolls are decorated in vibrant colors with simplistic design, lacking a true giraffe fur pattern or texture, as giraffe fur is typically complex with distinct patterns and texture. While they feature giraffe elements (like a giraffe head on the largest doll), the characteristic fur texture is not present.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the different sizes of the Russian nesting dolls smooth, without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls gradually decrease in size as expected. They appear well-crafted with smooth transitions, which is typical of Russian nesting dolls, designed to fit seamlessly into one another. The shape and design do not exhibit any odd seams or edges, indicating quality construction in line with their traditional design.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of the Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table look balanced and natural, without any dolls appearing to float or overlap unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls are arranged in a straight line, each standing upright on the wooden table. They appear evenly spaced and accurately positioned on the surface, with no indication of overlap or floating. The placement reflects a natural and balanced display typical for showcasing such items.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the Russian nesting dolls and the wooden table consistent with the lighting in the original image, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears natural with even illumination across the dolls and the table. The shadows cast by the dolls appear soft and consistent with ambient indoor lighting. There are no unrealistic highlights or dark spots that disrupt the image's overall cohesion, suggesting that the lighting was well considered in the composition.",
