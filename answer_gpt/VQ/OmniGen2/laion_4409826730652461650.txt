    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes are large and expressive, positioned near the center of the face as is common in cartoon stylizations, which is a departure from the original plush design in Image A, where the eyes are more proportionately placed and less pronounced. The mouth in Image B is a simple line, typical for cartoon characters, deviating from the plush's more realistic, detailed mouth. Therefore, the proportions are not consistent with the original design.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
    "explanation": "The lasso in Image B is neatly placed above the horse's head in a circular motion, shown in a way that suggests it is airborne. It does not touch or intersect with any part of the horse's body, maintaining the illusion of motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
    "explanation": "The background elements in Image B, such as the cacti and saloon buildings, appear to be generally aligned but lack discernible shadows that correspond to a specific light source, rendering them flat. This lack of shadowing makes it difficult to assess their alignment and interaction with light realistically.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
    "explanation": "Image B employs a cartoon style, resulting in the horse's fur being depicted as a single flat color without texture, unlike the original Image A where the plush toy's fur texture is visible. Similarly, the rocking base in Image B lacks the tangible plastic details observable in Image A, as it is presented in a greatly simplified form.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text is clearly positioned at the top right of the panel on the right side, without overlapping the horse or background elements. It is distinct and separated, ensuring readability and consistency with standard design practices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is rendered in a stylized cartoon form that does not maintain the proportional accuracy of the original plush toy's mechanical structure. The legs and base are simplified and consist of basic shapes that are disproportionate compared to the realistic assembly found in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
