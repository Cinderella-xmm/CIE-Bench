      "question": "Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the scanner with a metallic texture applied. To evaluate this texture, I look at the overall lighting and reflection patterns along the body. Judging by common metallic texture standards, these textures should have uniform reflections consistent with a light source. However, the reflections on the edited scanner appear somewhat inconsistent, suggesting adjustments were made for visual effects. These could lead to highlights that don't match a real-world light source. Given the above, the highlights seem inconsistent with realistic lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scanner’s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display on the scanner's front is assessed by observing the representation of depth and edge translucency. A proper holographic display should give the illusion of depth and be aligned with the scanner’s shape. In Image B, the display appears more as an inserted 2D illustration rather than an integral part of the design with layers or depth. Its appearance lacks the expected visual depth and seamless integration, making it more akin to a direct overlay.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To evaluate the grid lines, one must check their spacing, continuity, and alignment with the device. Image B features grid lines that seem misaligned and with varying gaps, suggesting uneven spacing. There are potential interruptions and breaks, indicating digital modification artifacts rather than a uniform design. These factors lead to the conclusion that the grid lines do not meet expected uniform standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing the tech-themed icons involves checking their clarity, legibility, scale, and positioning. In Image B, the icons and branding are potentially legible and placed on the front, but they don't interfere with the paper feed or control panel. They are mainly on the side areas, reducing the risk of intrusion into functional components of the scanner, maintaining adequate balance between design and function.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To evaluate dimensionality and spatial relationships, compare Image A and B concerning component placement. In Image B, the transformation into packaging appears to maintain the overall layout of key features like the paper feed slot and control panel. However, the device now resembles a box, distorting the original proportions. Key parts like paper slots and control panels align correctly, showing adherence to the original design layout. Despite its overall shape change, critical spatial relationships remain intact.",
