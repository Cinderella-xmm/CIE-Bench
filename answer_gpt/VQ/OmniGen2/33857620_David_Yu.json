      "question": "Does the transformed roof retain its triangular silhouette with smooth, continuous edges and display detailed icy etchings that appear integrated into the surface rather than overlaid or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof indeed retains a triangular silhouette and exhibits intricate designs that resemble icy etchings. The edges of the roof appear smooth and continuous, suggesting a seamless integration of the etchings into the surface rather than a mere overlay. These details suggest a coherent transformation consistent with a magical or ethereal theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-covered areas transformed into wing-like forms that exhibit consistent translucency, subtle internal light diffusion, and seamless integration with the surrounding terrain without visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-covered areas have been transformed into what appear to be glowing wing-like structures. These structures are translucent, with a consistent diffusion of light across the forms, integrating seamlessly with the terrain. There are no visible seams or abrupt changes in brightness, indicating a high level of integration with the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the rocky outcrops in the foreground and midground form leg-like structures with anatomically plausible proportions, smooth transitions between segments, and moss textures that match the surrounding environment without appearing pasted or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any transformation of rocky outcrops into leg-like structures. Instead, the foreground and midground remain consistent with the original image, maintaining the natural appearance of the terrain and rocks.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stream display a uniform, low-intensity glow along its entire length that follows the natural flow path, without sudden bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent illumination patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stream in Image B does not exhibit any glowing effect. It maintains its natural appearance without any added glow or alteration of its natural flow path. There are no signs of added brightness or altered illumination patterns, ensuring consistency with the original flow of the water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fog layer distributed evenly across the upper mountain regions and seamlessly blended with the sky and terrain, preserving depth cues and avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fog layer appears evenly distributed across the upper mountain regions. There is a seamless blending with the sky and terrain, which preserves depth cues and avoids abrupt transitions. The fog maintains a natural appearance without introducing any unnatural cloud formations.",
