      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the outlines around each rose petal uniform, continuous, and free of pixelation or irregular breaks that would indicate an unnatural transition from organic form to mosaic pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose petals are represented by mosaic tiles, where the outlines of each petal are created using smooth, continuous lines of green tiles and small, white tiles. This design maintains a uniform outline without pixelation or breaks, commonly seen in mosaic art. Unlike organic rose petals with natural variances and irregularities, the mosaic representation focuses on consistent and clear separations between individual tiles, which contribute to a uniform and coherent appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the petals exhibit smooth transitions between light and dark areas consistent with pearl-like reflectivity, and do the leaves show subtle jade-like translucency without visible texture distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals are made of white tiles with a relatively uniform color, lacking the smooth transitions found in pearl-like surfaces. Mosaics typically consist of solid color tiles, unlike natural objects that show subtle color gradations. The leaves are shown in a bright green, also using uniformly colored tiles, without any semblances of translucency or gradation. This uniform tile appearance does not imply translucency or reflectivity. Hence, the mosaic lacks the organic texture and subtle light effects expected in pearl and jade materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the architectural features like the arched window and corner pilasters preserved in shape and proportion despite being converted into terracotta-colored tiles, and do they align seamlessly with adjacent mosaic sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains a mosaic that occupies a single flat plane on a building wall. There are no visible architectural features from the original Image A, like an arched window or pilasters. Instead, the focus is on the floral mosaic itself. As a two-dimensional representation made with tiles, the design doesn't include three-dimensional architectural details. Given this setup, no alignment with adjacent sections is necessary because there are no sections except for the floral display itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mosaic rose bush maintain correct spatial placement relative to the building behind it, with no floating or misplaced elements suggesting incorrect depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic representation of roses is set within a square frame on a flat wall. Unlike the three-dimensional spatial arrangement perceived in Image A, where roses appear in front of a building, the mosaic does not depict any depth or complex spatial arrangement. All elements are confined to a single flat plane with no visual interaction with the building's space. Therefore, the question of depth perception or misplaced elements doesn't apply in this artistic context.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as petal layers, leaf venation, and brick joints preserved in a stylized yet coherent manner, without appearing smeared, distorted, or replaced by flat, featureless surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic in Image B inherently lacks the capacity to depict fine details akin to real flowers or bricks due to the general nature of tile materials. Mosaics use discrete, shape-defined tiles that do not include intricate details like venation or realistic petal layers. While the tiles are stylized, they do not smear or distort the design; however, they do not capture the finite details either, being inherently simpler and more abstract. Thus the interpretation of 'preserved' is relative to mosaic art standards rather than natural representation.",
