    "Question": "Q1: Are the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves with consistent shading and no jagged edges or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe are designed with a consistent organic shape and smooth edges. The shading is uniform across the leaves, indicating they are processed or created digitally with attention to detail and quality control. Since the leaves look digitally rendered and lack jagged edges or noticeable pixelation, they appear well integrated into the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the packaged giraffe toy against the jungle-themed backdrop, lacking an indoor scene with animal footprints on a floor. Without visible footprints, we cannot assess their path, depth, or spacing. Image A depicts a room with various plush toys, but this comparison is unnecessary since Image B doesn't contain relevant elements.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the clear packaging around each plush toy transparent with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toyâ€™s shape beneath, consistent with real plastic wrap?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a graphics design for packaging with illustrative elements of a giraffe toy. It doesn't display multiple plush toys within clear packaging. Without packaging elements, the description of transparent plastic wrap with visible highlights or distortion doesn't apply to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the colorful letters on the wall aligned properly with the wall surface, showing no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling?",
    "explanation": "Image B represents a jungle-themed package design with 'Jungle Friends Adventure' printed prominently. The text is integrally part of the design, aligned, and scaled properly within the package dimensions. Image A features a room, but letters on a wall aren't visible; thus, assessment based on Image B indicates proper font aesthetics within the packaging graphics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the giraffe retain its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe appears as a well-proportioned, digitally illustrated toy, maintaining realistic features without visible distortion. Image A showcases a plush giraffe toy indoors, yet Image B's edited depiction as a package illustration successfully retains the giraffe's soft fabric texture appearance, consistent body proportions, and lacks unnatural seams or alterations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
