      "question": "Do the ember-like orbs maintain spherical shape and uniform size, with swirling magma patterns that appear continuous and natural without broken lines or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B does not directly show ember-like orbs, the central feature contains a gem-like element with ornamental details.

Although no literal swirling magma is present, the gem's design maintains continuity and does not exhibit broken lines or color bleeding.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the phoenix claws correctly proportioned and shaped with natural joint angles, and does the flame they hold emit a soft, diffused glow without harsh outlines or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of phoenix claws is highly stylized and integrates smoothly with the overall design of the creature. While there are no visible flames held by the claws in this creation, the detailing suggests proportional accuracy and artistic coherence without harsh or unnatural lighting. The illustration emphasizes elegance and a diffused appearance of light effects, consistent with the fantasy theme.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the newly added magical elements (plumage, embers, claws, flame) cast shadows and reflect light consistently with the ambient lighting of the wooden surface, avoiding floating or disconnected appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magical elements of the phoenix are depicted with vibrant colors and gradients that suggest lighting effects typical of glowing or illuminated objects. The highlights and shadows are designed to appear consistent with ambient lighting, with careful attention to the overall aesthetic. While there might be a perceptible 'floating' quality due to the mythical nature of the subject, the artistic intention seems to be expressive rather than literal, creating coherence in the image's fantasy context.",
