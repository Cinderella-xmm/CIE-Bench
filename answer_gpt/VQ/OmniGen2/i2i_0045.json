      "question": "Are the girl, stone platform, and frisbee free of unnatural distortions or artifacts, appearing structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it contains a vast, open field with grass and a clear blue sky. There are no evident distortions or anomalies in the field’s structure such as unusual bending or pixelation, indicating structural coherence. However, there is no girl, stone platform, or frisbee visible in the image to assess for distortions. Thus, without those elements being present, I can confidently deduce this aspect is inapplicable.",

      "question": "Does the grass and blue sky background integrate smoothly with the foreground elements, avoiding obvious seams or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases an expansive field of grass under a clear blue sky. The textures seem consistent and natural, with no visible seams or harsh transitions between sky and grass areas. Without any foreground elements such as a girl, stone platform, or frisbee present, the integration of the grass and sky itself, not involving additional objects, is harmonious within the image’s entirety.",

      "question": "Do the girl, stone platform, and frisbee adhere to the golden ratio principles in their positioning, creating a balanced and visually credible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which consists solely of a landscape, there is no presence of a girl, stone platform, or frisbee to analyze for placement according to the golden ratio. The range of green fields and blue sky contributes to a basic natural composition but does not involve the elements mentioned to assess balance or aesthetics based on the golden ratio.",

      "question": "Are the fine details like the texture of the girl's clothing, the surface of the stone platform, and the frisbee preserved clearly without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any details relating to a girl's clothing, stone platform surface, or a frisbee for evaluation. The grass field is visually intact, with a smooth, natural texture; however, clothing and object details are absent for assessment of clarity or degradation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee match the lighting conditions of the new grass and sky background, avoiding mismatched shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits steady lighting across the landscape, highlighting the natural vertical sky gradient without a girl, stone platform, or frisbee for comparison of lighting congruence. Thus, without those elements to evaluate lighting consistency or shadow matching with the existing background, this aspect cannot be assessed.",
