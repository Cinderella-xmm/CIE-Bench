      "question": "Is the golden title banner positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting the cat’s head or the window frame, and does it have a natural metallic sheen that matches the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner is positioned at the top of Image B and does not overlap or distort the cat’s head or the window frame. It has a consistent natural metallic sheen, which matches the ambient lighting of the rest of the image, suggesting careful integration with the overall color scheme and light source.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nameplate located at the bottom of the image without intersecting or deforming the cat’s tail or the wooden floor, and does it have clean edges and consistent material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nameplate at the bottom does not intersect or deform the cat’s tail or the wooden floor. It is designed with clean edges and exhibits a consistent texture that harmonizes well with the material appearance of the rest of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stat bars clearly visible and positioned without overlapping the cat’s fur or the window, and do they use a font and color scheme that match the overall polished, soft 3D art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stat bars in Image B are clearly visible, well-positioned, and do not overlap the cat’s fur or the window. They use a font and color scheme that align with the polished and soft 3D art style of Image B, ensuring a cohesive visual appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the metallic trim form a complete, continuous border around the image without gaps, misaligned corners, or unnatural reflections that contradict the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic trim in Image B forms a complete and continuous border around the image. There are no visible gaps or misaligned corners, and the reflections on the trim are consistent with the direction of lighting, which maintains the natural look of the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style where the cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all exhibit smooth textures and no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style. The cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all have smooth textures without any pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions, enhancing the overall high-quality appearance of the image.",
