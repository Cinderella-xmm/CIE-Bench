      "question": "Does the cat’s curled-up posture in the chibi illustration match the original position on the car hood and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted in a chibi illustration style, which simplifies and exaggerates features for artistic effect. The posture is a curled-up position common in cats and is similar in concept to a real cat lying comfortably. Analyzing Image A, the cat is indeed curled up comfortably, with its structure visibly coherent. Comparing both images, Image B maintains a similar curled posture but also stylizes it, which changes certain proportions for aesthetic reasons and does not directly match the original position or structural consistency of Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gradient color blocks used to depict the cat’s fur smooth and free from unnatural textures or color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur on the cat is illustrated using blocks of color that aim to provide a simplified representation, typical in chibi artwork. While it lacks the detailed realism of fur textures, it is smooth and consistent for this style. Comparing to Image A, the cat's fur shows natural textures and color variations. The illustration in Image B omits these realistic textures for stylistic consistency and smoothness seen in gradient color blocks, not unnatural.",

      "question": "Does the car appear as a curved surface with reflection lines only, maintaining its structural integrity and avoiding obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a car surface; instead, it focuses solely on the simplified illustration of the cat, which indicates it is a sticker design with no reflections or car surfaces as part of the drawing. In Image A, we observe the car with structural features and reflections consistent with realism. Comparing both images, Image B has no representation of a car surface to critically assess its integrity or presence of artifacts related to reflections, as these do not exist in the illustration.",

      "question": "Is the sticker outlined with a thick white line and does it have a transparent background, retaining the visual coherence of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the chibi cat illustration with a clearly defined thick white border. This is a common design choice for stickers meant to distinguish the graphic element from other backgrounds. The surrounding area is transparent, suggesting its use can apply without disrupting underlying surfaces. Comparing to Image A, the sticker design in Image B maintains coherence separately and is visually presented with a border and transparent background without visible contrast against its environment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any unnatural textures been introduced, or have key details of the cat and car been lost in the chibi illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat illustration adopts a chibi style, which inherently simplifies and stylizes features for a cartoonish effect. This results in loss of intricate details such as realistic fur texture or the precise characteristics of the car's surface. Comparing to Image A, where we see detailed features of a real cat and car, Image B does lose these key details in favor of artistic simplification typical of chibi art. The simplification process does not introduce unnatural textures; rather, it omits detailed realism for style.",
