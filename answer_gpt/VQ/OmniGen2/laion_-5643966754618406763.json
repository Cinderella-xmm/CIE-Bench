    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tread patterns have been transformed into armored segments on the body of a creature. The armored pattern on the creature has a consistent design without noticeable repetition, which suggests a thoughtful reinterpretation of the tire tread into an entirely new form. The detailing appears intricate and lacks any evident loss of detail, which means the transformation process has been executed while preserving the quality of the texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic joints in Image B are integrated into the wheel openings. There are no visual indications of misalignment, gaps, or deformation. The connection to the rims appears structurally sound and cohesive, which implies that the joints align properly and maintain a realistic physical connection, similar to the functional appearance in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing mechanical elements resemble eyes and are situated within the centers of the hubs. They emit a consistent light source without observable haloing, pixelation, or excessive spillover onto nearby surfaces, maintaining a neat appearance. The illumination is confined to the areas it should affect, which suggests an even and controlled light emission.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a creature with antennae-like structures protruding from the top of its body. The attachment points appear seamless without any visible gaps or disjointed segments relative to the main body. The geometry is continuous and smooth, indicating a successful integration of these features onto the figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is cohesively formed into a creature-like figure, utilizing the tires as essential components of its design. The parts are all in place, well-scaled relative to each other, with no indication of missing or duplicated components. The assembly appears deliberate and balanced, maintaining both aesthetic and structural integrity.",
