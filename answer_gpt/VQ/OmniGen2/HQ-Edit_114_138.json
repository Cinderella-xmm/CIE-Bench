    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silk robe lacks natural fabric texture, as it appears more illustrated with flat color and uniform design without the nuanced play of light that would occur on a real silk material. The floral patterns are consistent but do not interact with light in a realistic manner, appearing more drawn onto the surface rather than integrated into the fabric's weave.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book takes on an illustrated appearance, where the pages and cover are highly uniform and lack the irregularities found in real books. The pages and cover appear cohesive, without broken edges or inconsistencies, matching the expectations for a stylized, simplified depiction rather than a realistic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf elements are reduced and stylized, appearing more like decorative icons rather than functional shelves as in Image A. The alignment, spacing, and wood texture are altered, emphasizing a more graphic and less realistic approach. These changes disrupt the visual coherence as functional bookshelves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible bookmark panels, effectively eliminating the need for assessment on their correctness in terms of scale, orientation, or placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face is blurred in both images, there is no relevant visible information to assess the proportional accuracy or plausibility regarding the facial features around the eyes and mouth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
