      "question": "Are the shapes and arrangements of the fruits in the platter consistent and unaltered, avoiding any distortions or unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the fruits on the platter, including sliced pineapple, kiwi, pear, watermelon, orange, banana, and blueberries, maintain their natural shapes and arrangements. There is no visual evidence of distortion or deformation; they appear just as they would in a real fruit platter, suggesting consistency with traditional fruit arrangements. Comparison with Image A shows that there are no alterations that would disrupt their natural appearance.",

      "question": "Does the transition between the light green gradient background and the fruit platter look natural without any abrupt edges or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the light green gradient background to the fruit platter is smooth and consistent, with no abrupt edges or visual discrepancies. The gradient moves seamlessly from the background, enveloping the platter area in a way that maintains a coherent visual flow. This contributes to a professional packaging design where elements are integrated naturally.",
