      "question": "Do the vine-like tendrils follow the natural contour of the head without floating or breaking apart at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine-like tendrils, possibly intended to mimic floral elements or accessories, are visually scanned. They appear naturally interwoven with the individual's hair, maintaining coherence with the overall structure without floating or appearing unnatural. The tendrils exhibit a seamless integration into the hair, suggestive of careful alignment that respects the natural contour of the head.",

      "question": "Are the laurel leaves and pastel flowers aligned naturally within the hair structure without overlapping the face or appearing detached from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laurel leaves and flowers are visually assessed for their placement within the hair. They appear to be strategically placed to complement the hairstyle, with no overlap over the face or any indication that they are detached from the head. The floral elements are well-integrated, suggesting a natural and intentional design.",

      "question": "Does the emerald green tunic show natural fabric folds and shading that match the posture and lighting of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald green tunic in Image B is observed for its fabric dynamics. The folds and drapes of the fabric appear realistic, following the contours of the body in a manner consistent with gravity and natural pose. Additionally, the shading on the tunic aligns with the posture and ambient lighting, indicating a harmonious and realistic depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the twisted olive trees and marble fragments positioned at a plausible distance from the subject, with correct perspective and no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements, such as the twisted olive trees and marble fragments, are evaluated. They appear appropriately scaled and positioned, creating a realistic depth and perspective. None of the elements seem to float or misalign with the rest of the scene, suggesting a consistent and well-composed background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the subject’s face and clothing align with the ambient light source suggested by the background environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadow dynamics in Image B are considered for alignment. The shadows and illumination on the clothing—and by implication, the face region—are coherent with the natural light source suggested by the soft ambient light casting over the scene, indicating a synchronized lighting setup.",
