      "question": "Does the lime wedge retain its natural green hue and textured rind, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even after being shaped into a smiling cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge is depicted as an illustration rather than a photographic object. It maintains a bright green color typical of limes. However, the lime is stylized and lacks the detailed texture that would be seen on a real lime rind, as depicted in Image A. The smiling cap shape is part of the playful character design and not a natural lime representation. Hence, while it is visually consistent in color, it does not retain a natural textured rind due to its stylized nature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ice cubes in Image B are stylized as part of a cartoon character design and represent eyes rather than typical ice cubes. They are drawn with solid outlines and do not exhibit the typical translucency or sharp edges associated with real ice cubes as seen in Image A. Their placement is more for visual effect than realism, and hence they appear slightly unnatural in terms of floating within the liquid.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sugar rim along the glass edge uniformly granular and continuous, with no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring that disrupts the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sugar rim is depicted in a stylized form, consistent with a cartoon illustration. The rim appears to be made of artificial coloring and lacks the natural granular texture of salt or sugar crystals as shown in Image A. The uniformity is preserved for visual clarity rather than realistic texture, which does not align perfectly with the portrayal of natural granularity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sombrero and maracas have consistent material textures (e.g., woven straw, wood grain, reflective beads), correct scale relative to the glass, and proper shadows that match the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sombrero and maracas are drawn in a stylized manner. They lack realistic material textures such as woven straw and wood grain, which would be expected in a photograph. Their scale is adjusted to fit the cartoon character design, and while shadows are applied, they do not necessarily reflect an accurate lighting direction as these are illustrations rather than realistic representations.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the confetti pieces varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows, and do they appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The confetti in Image B are colorful and vary in shape, consistent with a festive cartoon atmosphere. They have soft edges but do not exhibit subtle shadows or depth, nor do they appear naturally placed concerning the other objects in the image. Their positioning is primarily for decorative purposes and does not give the impression of lying naturally on any surface, as in a real photograph.",

      "question": "Is the text “Fiesta Time!” clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements, and does it have consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fiesta Time!' is prominently highlighted at the top and is clearly visible without overlapping or distorting other visual elements. The stroke width is consistent throughout the text, and the use of anti-aliasing results in smooth edges, making the text visually consistent and legible.",
