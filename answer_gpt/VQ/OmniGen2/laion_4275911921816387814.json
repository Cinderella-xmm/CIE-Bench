    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the silver-gray fabric on the blade retain the original blade's curved shape and pattern details without distortion or loss of fine lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade of the dagger is constructed in a plush, soft style, which suggests that it is made of fabric, likely padded or stuffed. The 'blade' has a visibly stitched surface, indicating it has been shaped for a toy or decorative purpose. The patterns on this fabric are simplified and embroidered, lacking the intricate detailing and fine lines seen in a real engraved metal blade, as depicted in Image A. Therefore, the curves and patterns on the plush version are more abstract and less detailed than the original metal version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the edges of the hilt smoothly rounded and consistent in curvature, without abrupt flattening or irregular bulges suggesting poor volume shaping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hilt of the dagger is crafted in a plush, padded style, suggesting a soft material. The seams and padded divisions are visible, indicating intentional shaping to mimic the original hilt design. The edges are smooth and consistently curved, reflecting a well-shaped fabrication process. This is consistent with how plush toys or decoratives are typically shaped for aesthetic purposes. The hilt in Image A is also smooth and polished, being part of a solid material, without imperfections in its volume shaping, matching a common design for practical daggers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blade’s tip preserved as a pointed, slightly curved end without drooping or flattening due to over-stuffing or under-support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade's tip is part of the plush construction, which typically involves soft materials that can exhibit slight curvature due to padding. It should maintain a pointed end. Observing the plush dagger's blade, it maintains a soft version of a pointed, slightly curved end without significant drooping or flattening, suggesting a reasonable level of support and stuffing. In Image A, the metal blade features a clear, sharp point, typical for a dagger with practical use.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black embroidered patterns uniformly spaced and aligned along the blade’s length, matching the original engraving’s density and symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns are embroidered in black thread on a white fabric blade, designed to emulate the engraving style of a real dagger, as seen in Image A. The plush dagger features simpler, less dense patterns compared to the complex, tightly spaced engravings of the original. While the plush version maintains alignment along the blade's length, it lacks the intricate, dense engraving details that are apparent in the metal blade of Image A, which are more precise and symmetrical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a consistent, flat solid color without visible gradients, shadows, or texture that could imply improper rendering or compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a bright red, appearing consistent and flat with no visible gradients, shadows, or textures. This suggests a deliberate choice for a solid, clean backdrop to emphasize the plush dagger. In contrast, Image A features a neutral, slightly textured background, possibly a fabric surface, which is typical for many display or product images but not relevant to the evaluation of Image B's background.",
