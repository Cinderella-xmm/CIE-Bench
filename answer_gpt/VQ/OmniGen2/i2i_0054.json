      "question": "Does the newly added matte gray background appear uniform and free of any distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire background is a solid matte gray color, which appears uniform throughout the image. There are no visible lines, gradients, or patterns that would indicate any distortion or unnatural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the absence of shadows make the elephant appear unnaturally floating or disconnected from the surface beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is placed against a gray background without any visible shadows beneath it or around its limbs, which typically help anchor objects to the ground and provide a sense of depth. The lack of shadows can indeed make the elephant appear as if it is not interacting naturally with a surface, making it look like it's floating or disconnected.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures on the elephant's skin preserved without noticeable loss after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin appears to maintain the textures and details such as the wrinkles and natural skin variations. The change in background does not seem to have affected these details, indicating that the textures are preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the absence of banana shape and metal stand curves, which were not part of the original elephant image, result in any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the background elements related to a banana shape and metal stand are removed, leaving only the elephant. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistencies that would suggest unnatural modifications in the transition, indicating that the removal does not create any visual issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain its correct proportions and physical rationality relative to the new matte gray background, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears to maintain the same proportions as it would in a natural setting when observed against the matte gray background. No visual distortions or disproportionate elements are present as a result of the background change, preserving the physical rationality of the elephant.",
