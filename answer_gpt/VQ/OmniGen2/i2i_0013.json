      "question": "Does the subject maintain a recognizable likeness to the original person despite being transformed into an enamel pin style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In assessing the transformation into an enamel pin style, we focus on elements such as hair and clothing details, which can hint at identity despite the stylistic rendering. The flowing hair and the tie in Image B suggest a male subject with a potential intellectual aura, commonly associated with figures like Albert Einstein. These attributes are preserved in the transformation, making the likeness recognizable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy metal outlines smooth and free of any rough or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glossy metal outlines of an enamel pin should be sleek and clear. In Image B, the outlines appear smooth, defining the edges without any visible jaggedness or pixelation that could suggest inadequate rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the subject retain its proper proportions and geometric shapes, avoiding any distortion or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Proportions in enamel pin versions should ideally preserve the original's geometric shapes without distortion. In Image B, elements like the tie and hair are proportionate and reflect the typical styling of the original subject in a balanced manner, suggesting there is no distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the subject's facial hair and hairline been preserved accurately in the enamel pin rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While using an enamel pin style, one expects simplified rendering but still hopes for key distinct features like facial hair and hairline to be represented accurately. Image B preserves characteristic elements of the subject's hair and overall style sufficiently for an enamel style, although simplified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background clean, uniformly white, and free from any unwanted artifacts or additional features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A clean background is often used in enamel pin designs to emphasize the subject itself. In Image B, the background is predominantly white and free from extraneous artifacts or design elements, focusing attention solely on the subject.",
