      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the edited image (Image B), the visible bronze parts such as the body and accessories provide an indication of the material change. The bronze material might give a uniform look, which could potentially lead to minor loss of detail in finer features such as whiskers. However, the shape of the nose and mouth can remain preserved under the bronze casting process, provided the casting was well executed. Without referring to Image A for comparison, it is challenging to assess exact preservation, but assuming a careful conversion process, these features could be preserved as bronze statues commonly maintain basic shapes even though some finer details may blend. Therefore, my reasoning leads me to conclude:",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze helmet appears to be integrated well with the head of the sculpture in Image B. There is no visible misalignment or gaps, and the transitions at the edges appear smooth, suggesting that the helmet is scaled and positioned properly. The design and casting of bronze would typically ensure a snug fit, maintaining the correct placement on the figure's head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the glasses themselves are obscured by the blurred region, the alignment of glasses typically should match that of the eyes in such sculptures. Without knowing their exact positioning due to the blur, we can infer based on typical bronze art that frames would be well-fitted. However, precise details about the lens reflection and transparency are unavailable due to the image capture limitations or design choice, leading me to conclude:",

      "question": "Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze sweater and shoulder strap appear to maintain a uniform and consistent shape, without any breaks in the contour. The engraved lines of the garment follow the body contour smoothly, suggesting that the design elements are preserved during the conversion to bronze, indicating a meticulous attention to detail in capturing the garment's texture and shape.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the marble base is visible beneath the sculpture, appearing proportional and large enough to support the statue. There is no evident gap between the figure's feet and the base, which suggests appropriate positioning and connection. The proportion of the base is adequate to provide stability and support to the sculpture, aligning with typical practices in statues of this nature.",
