      "question": "Do the added LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design appear naturally integrated into the scene without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure and the pear-inspired design are encapsulated in a glass case. The figures look consistent with a typical LEGO minifigure and a stylized pear, reflecting the appearance of such miniature toys. The textures, including the smoothness of the LEGO plastic and the polished finish of the structured pear, blend well within the scene, showing no visible signs of rendering errors or texture misalignment. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on these objects are consistent with the rest of the scene, which supports the perception of a natural integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design logically consistent with the size and scale of the pear and smartphone in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigure in Image B is proportionally smaller than the pears, matching the expected size relative to fruit and reinforcing the typical size of LEGO minifigures. Given that LEGO toys are small compared to everyday objects like fruits, these proportions seem appropriate. The pear-inspired animal design also aligns with the size expectations of such stylized toy elements, making the overall composition and scale appear coherent and believable.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the glass cube, matte black base, and nameplate retain their natural appearance and fine details without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube in Image B has a clear and transparent quality common to display cases, and its edges and reflections are consistent with optical glass properties. The matte black base shows a consistent, even texture reflective of non-glossy materials. Additionally, the nameplate has a polished finish with engraved text that appears clear, though somewhat abstract in design. Together, these elements maintain their material authenticity and exhibit no obvious digital artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the LEGO minifigure, pear-inspired animal, and nameplate within the transparent glass cube create a visually coherent and plausible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal are centrally positioned within the glass cube in Image B, balancing the scene and creating a focus on these elements. The nameplate is on the front of the base, enhancing the sense of a curated display. These placements are logically arranged to parallel how collectibles might be showcased, contributing to the visual coherence and plausibility of the composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and background color transition from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone enhance the natural appearance and authenticity of the wooden surface and other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background smoothly transitions from a warm caramel shade to a cream tone, which provides a warm and inviting atmosphere. This gradient subtly enhances the hues and textures of the wooden surface, pears, and other elements by reflecting a soft, even lighting that adds depth and naturalness to the scene. Such lighting effects are known to enhance the perception of quality and realism in still life photography.",
