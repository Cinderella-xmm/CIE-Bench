    "Question": "Q4: Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates inconsistencies in rendering of debris elements, presenting them as uniformly shadowed and floating rather than integrated fully into a more dynamic 3D space, which suggests a flat pasting effect overall.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q6: Is the action bubble placed in a visible area of the image without covering Naruto’s hand or the fusion point, and does it use consistent styling with the dialogue bubble?",
    "explanation": "The styling of the action bubble in Image B corresponds aesthetically with the dialogue bubble. Despite not overlapping Naruto's hand or the depicted fusion element, its placement could be perceived as slightly intrusive, although it maintains a coherent visual style.",
