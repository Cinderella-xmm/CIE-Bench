    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the restored areas of the clock tower seamlessly integrate with the original stone texture, avoiding any visible seams or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the restored areas of the clock tower appear to merge well with the original stone texture. The stone surface shows a consistent pattern with the rest of the tower, without visible seams or patches that stand out as different. This suggests that the restoration work was carried out with attention to maintaining the uniformity of the stone texture, avoiding any interruptions that would make the new sections look distinct from the existing structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the restored sections, such as the arches and clock face, consistent with the rest of the tower, avoiding any distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the restored sections, including arches and clock face, are designed to match the proportions and shapes with the rest of the tower. They exhibit continuity in terms of architectural style and design elements. Comparing to Image A, especially the damaged arches, the repairs in Image B reflect an understanding of structural symmetry and architectural coherence, avoiding any noticeable distortions or irregularities that could detract from their aesthetic and functional alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as cracks and weathering patterns, been accurately replicated in the restored sections, preserving the historical look without losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that while the restoration provides structural integrity, the replication of fine historical details such as cracks and weathering is less evident compared to Image A. The restoration seems more focused on structural completeness rather than mirroring the aged texture details such as the specific types of cracks found in Image A, which suggest historical weathering. Thus, while the tower looks intact, some historical detail might not be fully preserved in the new stonework.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the restoration work enhance the tower's completeness, making it appear as though it was never damaged, while preserving its architectural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon evaluating Image B, the restored sections do indeed enhance the tower's completeness, presenting a well-designed and intact structure. The restoration effort reconstructed the damaged parts, such as gaps and missing stone, offering a seamless architectural appearance. Comparing this to Image A, where damage was visible, Image B suggests that the tower appears whole and undamaged while maintaining its original architectural design, aligning with an effective restoration approach.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the restored sections exhibit the same lighting and shadow effects as the original parts of the tower, contributing to a natural and cohesive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting and shadows are consistent across both restored and original sections of the tower. The sunlight casts similar angles and intensities of shadows on the stone surfaces throughout the tower, indicating a thoughtful restoration that matches the natural lighting effects seen on the original parts of the structure. This uniformity contributes to a cohesive appearance, ensuring that the restored areas blend naturally with the rest of the tower's appearance under the same lighting conditions.",
