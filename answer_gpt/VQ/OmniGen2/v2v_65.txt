    "Question": "Q1: Does the character's 3D chibi appearance maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the character is presented as a 3D chibi figure inside a snow globe. This style is typically characterized by exaggerated features for cuteness, such as a larger head and smaller body proportions, which are evident here. The character maintains consistent proportions typical of the chibi style, and no visible distortions or artifacts are apparent. The textures and shadows are applied correctly, contributing to the overall visual credibility of the character's chibi form.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the icy reflections and gentle sparkles created by the soft daylight filtering through the frosty window appear natural and free from unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The soft daylight filtering through the frosty window creates subtle reflections and sparkles on the snow globe's surface. This effect is consistent with how light refracts and plays off glass surfaces in reality, displaying a natural gradation and highlighting that does not present any digital artifacts or unnatural refractions. The lighting treatment enhances the scene's realism and depth.",
