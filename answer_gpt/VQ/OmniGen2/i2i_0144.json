      "question": "Does the small flag reading 'Fresh' appear naturally placed on top of the sandwich without looking out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small flag reading 'Fresh' is positioned on top of the sandwich. The shaft of the flag appears properly inserted into the sandwich and is at an appropriate angle that creates a natural sense of placement. The text 'Fresh' is clearly legible, and the flag size is proportionate to the sandwich, making it blend well with the overall image. This indicates a natural placement and lack of distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich consistent after replacing the tomato slices with grilled pineapple, preserving the natural structure and layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the substitution of tomato slices with grilled pineapple slices, the sandwich layers have been altered. The pineapple slices are arranged fan-like which changes the typical layering seen in sandwiches. However, the overall structure of layers, such as the presence of lettuce and turkey, remains consistent with typical sandwiches despite the visible change. Layering consistency is thus partially preserved in a natural manner.",

      "question": "Does the small flag maintain its texture and detail, avoiding unnatural appearances or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small flag retains its texture and detail, as the flagpole and the flag bearing the inscription 'Fresh' are well-rendered without any apparent unnatural textures or artifacts. It appears coherently with the image's style, suggesting adequate texturing and detail retention.",

      "question": "Does the sandwich retain its structural coherence and visual plausibility after the edits, ensuring it looks authentic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandwich in Image B, after the edits which include the replacement of tomato with grilled pineapple, retains structural coherence. Even with the alteration, the sandwich maintains its plausible structure, with layers such as the lettuce and turkey in place, and there's no indication of any unrealistic alterations within the composition of the layers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the grilled pineapple slices fit proportionally within the sandwich, maintaining a natural and realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grilled pineapple slices appear well-integrated into the sandwich both in proportion and placement. The size and positioning are consistent with how a layer in a sandwich might realistically appear, not seemingly overpowering the other components, which suggests that their inclusion maintains a natural and realistic appearance.",
