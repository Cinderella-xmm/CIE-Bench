    "Question": "Q1: Are the clothing details and racket textures of the tennis players depicted in a natural oil painting style without visible unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and racket textures of the tennis players are depicted with smooth brush strokes typical of an oil painting style.

    "Question": "Q2: Do the painted lines of the tennis court and the net maintain their structural consistency without appearing broken or distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, even though the scene has been altered to include natural surroundings instead of a typical court, carefully painted lines and net details maintain a degree of structural integrity relative to the stylistic depiction of an oil painting. Oil paintings generally don't maintain rigid geometrical precision but rather focus on overall harmony and aesthetics, which is not indicative of broken or distorted elements here.",
