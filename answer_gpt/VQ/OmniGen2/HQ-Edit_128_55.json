      "question": "Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathered wings are attached on the sides of the door-like structure. Analyzing the feathered extensions, they appear to be crafted from a material designed to mimic the look of feathers rather than wood. The wood grain and carving depth are distinct and do not seamlessly transition from the original panel edges. This indicates that the wings are a separate element not integrated with the wood grain of the original door.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a structural object with a cloak and crown, where the iron studs are prominently displayed. The studs appear to mimic design elements that suggest shimmering eyes, potentially through reflections or the studs' lighting, maintaining alignment along the central vertical strip as seen in the original door on Image A. Hence, they seem properly embedded without floating or misalignment issues.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crown emerging from the arch in Image B is positioned seamlessly integrated with the arch's curve. The curvature of the arch and its connection with the crown appears smooth with no visible breaks or floating pieces that might suggest an abrupt or flawed transition. The crown is designed to fit within the arch as an extension of the prior structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the etched runes visible across the doorâ€™s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the etched runes in Image B, they appear as consistent patterns across the door's surface mirroring the original carvings. The etched designs maintain the same depth and lighting coherence as the original patterns observed in Image A, demonstrating harmony without distortion or overlap of the pre-existing designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cloak-like material is crafted around the doorframe, imitating fabric folds. Analysis of these folds reveals consistent shading and lighting, giving them a natural fabric appearance. Despite the transformation, this structure appears seamlessly connected to the remaining stone frame without visible gaps or distortions compromising its integration with the surrounding architectural elements.",
