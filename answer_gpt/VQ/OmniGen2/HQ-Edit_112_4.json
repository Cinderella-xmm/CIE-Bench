    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the birdâ€™s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird under the glass dome appears anatomically correct with a natural appearance. The feathers are in place, characteristic of a blue jay. The proportions with respect to the head, body, and wings look balanced and true to a bird's physique, without any exaggerated or distorted elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears to be smooth and transparent. The reflections on its curvature seem uniform and consistent with a well-manufactured glass item. There are no signs of digital artifacts like seams or pixelation, ensuring the visual integrity of the glass surface is maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden perch is crafted to resemble a tree stump, complete with texture and wood grain, contributing to a realistic representation. The bird is placed securely on it, and there is no visual indication of gaps or floating elements that would compromise stability.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ivy vines are shown growing on the moss, with leaves that seem purposefully spaced and naturally oriented upwards. The leaves do not overlap one another excessively and do not appear to interfere with either the dome or the bird, maintaining spatial coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size of the leaves and the tree stump is meticulously crafted to suit the scale of the bird. This proportional comparison seems authentic, reflecting precision in their design. These elements, with noticeable texture details, blend naturally without appearing misaligned or unintegrated with the moss base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss base is depicted with varied hues of green, suggesting depth and organic texture. There are no sharp edges, and the transitions mimicking natural growth are smooth, absent of the uniformity that might hint at digital pasting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to come from the upper right, consistent with the highlights and shadows presented. The shadows beneath the bird, on the perch, and interacting with the dome follow a logical, soft gradient pattern corresponding with this light source, ensuring cohesion in illumination.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
