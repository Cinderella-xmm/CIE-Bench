    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass container maintain the original circular shape and proportions of the compass body, with no warped edges or irregular thickness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container is presented as a circular object, resembling the face of a compass. Based on its visual appearance, the container has a smooth and regular circular shape, indicating it maintains the original proportions seen in a compass body. There are no visible irregularities or warped edges that suggest distortion in the shape or thickness.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the spray nozzle centered within the glass container, aligned with the pivot point of the original needle, and does it have a smooth, continuous metallic surface without jagged edges or textural inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spray nozzle is positioned centrally in the glass container. The alignment suggests it corresponds to the pivot point of the needle usually seen in a compass. The visual analysis shows a smooth metallic surface with consistent texture, lacking any jagged edges or noticeable inconsistencies that would disrupt its appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the cap feature a detailed engraving of a vintage map that is evenly distributed across its surface, with no blurred lines or inconsistent depth, and is it attached seamlessly to the top of the glass container?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a cap on top of the container, but there are no visible details that signify an engraved vintage map. The surface appears sleek and polished without any intricate engraving details. The analysis of its attachment seems seamless, yet there are no lines or depth to indicate a map engraving.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the bronze gradient applied smoothly across the glass container and cap, with subtle variations in tone that simulate wear and light reflection, and no sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen?",
    "explanation": "The bronze gradient in Image B appears smooth across the container and cap. The variations in tone contribute to a realistic simulation of wear and light reflection, indicating a careful blending without sharp boundaries. The lack of artificial sheen supports the observation that the gradient is applied naturally.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the branding text visible along the outer rim of the glass container, with consistent font size and spacing, and does it appear embedded into the surface without overlapping or floating above it?",
    "explanation": "The branding text in Image B is observed along the outer rim of the glass container. Its font size and spacing appear consistent and the text seems embedded into the surface, maintaining clear coherence with the rim without signs of overlapping or floating, ensuring visual integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
