        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi art style, proportions are deliberately exaggerated for stylistic purposes, with larger heads and smaller bodies.

The mascot's legs appear consistent with the rest of its exaggerated body proportions and do not exhibit any distortion that would make them seem unnatural within the chibi context.",
