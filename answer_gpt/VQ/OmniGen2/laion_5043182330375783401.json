    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes applied to the suit clearly defined, aligned with the contours of the body, and free from jagged or broken edges that disrupt the figure’s natural posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B shows a clean and crisp design, with geometric shapes that are clearly defined and seamlessly follow the natural contours of the body. The lines and edges are smooth, complementing the figure's posture without any jaggedness. This suggests a high level of precision in design and alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chair retain a stable, grounded structure with symmetrical, flowing patterns that align with the figure’s seated position and do not appear to float or tilt unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair's design maintains symmetry and stability, with flowing patterns that are consistent with the seated figure's position. The chair does not exhibit any signs of floating or tilting, indicating a grounded and coherent structure that naturally complements the figure’s posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sunset gradient in the background smooth and continuous, with no abrupt color shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunset gradient in Image B is smooth and continuous, showing a gradual transition between colors. There are no abrupt shifts or halo effects along the edges of the figure, ensuring a seamless blend between the background and the foreground elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and blue areas of the suit show coherent highlights and reflections that follow a single light source and avoid repeating textures or unnatural glossiness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic areas of the suit in Image B exhibit consistent highlights and reflections, indicating the influence of a single light source. The glossiness appears natural and does not include any repeating textures that would disrupt the coherent appearance of the suit’s material.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand on the chair have five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and are the joints and knuckles proportionally accurate and not distorted by stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand resting on the chair displays five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature. The joints and knuckles are proportionally accurate, maintaining a realistic portrayal despite the stylized nature of the image.",
