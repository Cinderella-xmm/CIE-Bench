    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petal shapes appear to have been edited to exhibit a more faceted appearance, akin to crystal facets. These facets follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, shaped to mimic the original floral structure. There is no visible warping or geometric discontinuity; the petals maintain a realistic form, adhering closely to the original shapes observed in nature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass rods are edited to extend from the vase in a manner resembling the original arrangement of stems in Image A. They appear naturally positioned, maintaining the original number and spacing relative to the vase's opening, with no apparent disconnect or misalignment from the vase to the flowers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a black marble tabletop that is smooth, uniformly dark, with a reflective quality. The reflections and color on the surface align with the light source direction, maintaining consistency in shadows and highlights as would be expected from a polished, reflective surface. The reflection of the vase and the flowers matches the placement of the objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited petals display subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, simulating a crystalline appearance. These variations give the petals a sense of depth and translucency, as would be expected when light refracts through a semi-transparent material. The light refracts internally within the petals, suggesting not just surface color but volume and internal structure too.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass rods are depicted entering the water with realistic refraction at the waterline. The bending of the rods is consistent with how light refracts when passing between air and water, adhering to physical principles. The rods remain visible and submerged beneath the water surface, not floating or disappearing midway, aligning with natural expectations of submerged glass objects.",
