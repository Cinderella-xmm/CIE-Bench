      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso of the figurine is enlarged and exhibits smooth, rounded shoulders and a broad chest, suggesting a uniform scaling without any warping or stretching of anatomical features. This is evident from the symmetrical appearance and the balanced proportions around the neck, shoulders, and waist. World knowledge about proportionality in human-like figures supports the observation that everything appears consistent with the design of such figurines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the shirt uniformly matte with no glossy highlights or fabric weave patterns, indicating a polymer-like finish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a shirt surface that appears smooth and matte, without any glossy highlights or visible fabric weave patterns. The surface hints at a uniform finish resembling a polymer-like texture. This analysis is based on observing the complete absence of irregularities that might suggest fabric texture, as well as the smooth transitions across the entire shirt.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Craft\" logo clearly visible, elevated in appearance, and rendered in bold colors without blurring, misalignment, or clipping at its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Craft' logo is prominently visible on the chest of the figurine, rendered in bold white without any noticeable blurring or misalignment. The edges are crisp, indicating careful attention to detail that enhances the appearance of the logo as elevated and integrated onto the surface of the shirt.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base under the figurine in Image B displays clean, straight lines and smooth surfaces. The subtle reflective highlights confirm a metallic finish consistent with polished metal. The overall construction suggests that while it appears physically attached to the figure, it maintains a design that hints at separability due to the clearly defined edge and shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, including eyes, beard, glasses, and skin texture, preserved without distortion, blurring, or unnatural blending at the junction with the modified torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face, the remaining analysis within Image B provides no visible signs of distortion or blurring at the junction where the face meets the modified torso. The absence of facial features in the natural presentation supports that such elements are not preserved, but given the condition of no unnatural blending, the facial region transitions smoothly into the torso.",
