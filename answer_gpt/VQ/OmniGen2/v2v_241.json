      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant maintain their current pose without any unnatural distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style models of the horse and elephant are posed with the horse standing on top of the elephant. This pose is maintained without any apparent distortion or unnatural deformation. Both the horse and elephant appear to have smooth lines and appropriate curves characteristic of stylized, non-realistic representations like chibi-style. There is a clear intention for a cute, exaggerated appearance which aligns with their proportions and overall form.",

      "question": "Is the photorealistic background of the grassy field and sky free from any artifacts or distortions introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be simplified and stylized, not photorealistic. It complements the chibi-style of the animals, using bright colors and simple shapes for clouds and grass, matching the style of the models and ensuring no visual artifacts or distortions that might come from stitching or compositing errors are noticeable. This background effectively supports the whimsical nature of the chibi models without detracting from it.",

      "question": "Does the ornate photo frame blend naturally with the scene without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate frame in Image B surrounds the scene and provides a clear boundary between the stylized models and the viewer's surroundings. Its texture and color, while not matching the style of the models, act as a framing device and do not visually disrupt the immersive experience of the image. The frame's detailed textures do not introduce any discontinuities or visual artifacts that might seem out of place.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant preserved, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized proportions typical of chibi models are consistent, with exaggerated features like larger heads and smaller bodies. The horse and elephant models in Image B retain their smooth, coherent shapes without any broken geometric formations or unrealistic scaling that would contradict their intended art style. Their exaggerated style still allows them to appear stable and balanced in their pose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models retain fine details without any loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style models in Image B maintain a level of detail suitable for their stylized appearance, such as smooth textures and simplified features without hyper-realistic details. This maintains the integrity of the style â€” any absence of high-fidelity details is appropriate and not a loss of quality relative to the artistic intent. The textures feel consistent, with no signs of patchy or unnatural texture overlays.",
