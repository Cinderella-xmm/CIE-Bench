    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the wood grain on the pug's body appear continuous and natural, with no repeating patterns or unnatural stretching, especially along the spine and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug appears to be crafted entirely from wood, with a clear wood grain texture visible throughout its body. Upon inspecting the pug's spine and limbs, the grain pattern appears smooth and natural without any obvious repetition or unnatural stretching. The design looks consistent with a carved wood sculpture, where the grain follows the contours of the shape and does not disrupt the natural wooden appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and creases on the pug’s face rendered as smooth, shallow grooves consistent with carved wood, without sharp, broken, or overly deep lines that disrupt the natural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a pug where the facial creases and wrinkles are emulated using shallow grooves suggestive of carved wood. These grooves maintain a uniformity and smoothness appropriate for wood sculpture, avoiding sharp edges or overly deep lines that would disrupt the cohesive wooden look. This is consistent with a wooden carving that prioritizes smooth transitions on curved surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pug’s limbs, head, and torso retain their original proportions and anatomical alignment, with no visible elongation, compression, or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The anatomical structure of the pug in Image B, although represented in a stylized wooden form, retains the proportions and alignment typical of a pug without any visible distortion in its limbs, head, or torso. The design respects the characteristic squat body and round features of a pug, translated effectively into wood without unnecessary elongation or compression.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the transitions between different parts of the wooden pug (e.g., head to neck, ear to head) seamless, with no visible cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the wooden pug of Image B, the transitions between different parts such as head to neck and ear to head are smooth and seamless. There are no apparent cracks, ghosting effects, or discontinuities in color that could indicate a break in the visual continuity. This suggests a well-executed sculpture that considers the flow of material and gradient in wooden texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black base beneath the pug flat, uniformly dark, and fully supporting the pug’s feet without any gaps, shadows suggesting suspension, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black base in Image B is depicted as flat and consistently dark, providing a cohesive surface for the pug to rest upon. It appears to fully support the feet of the pug sculpture without gaps or shadows that might suggest suspension or misalignment, thus maintaining the holistic balance required for display purposes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the highlights and shadows on the wooden pug match the ambient lighting of the scene, with reflections and depth appropriate for polished wood rather than fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden pug exhibits highlights and shadows that are consistent with the ambient lighting of the scene. The reflections on its surface give it the appearance of polished wood, demonstrating depth and sheen indicative of a hard, glossy material rather than soft fur. The lighting enhances the wood grain texture, aligning with common practices in showcasing wooden sculptures.",
