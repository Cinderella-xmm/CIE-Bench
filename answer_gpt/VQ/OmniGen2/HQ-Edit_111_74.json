      "question": "Does the gold foil detailing on the kimono’s floral patterns appear uniformly reflective and seamlessly integrated with the red fabric, without visible textural mismatches or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold foil detailing on the kimono's floral patterns appears to smoothly integrate with the vivid red fabric.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent highlights in the woman’s hair distributed along natural light paths and do they display smooth color gradients without fragmented or unrealistic chromatic aberrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B displays the woman's hair under a bright, uniform lighting that creates natural highlights. However, the highlights do not have evident iridescence seen in real scenarios under natural light paths; they are more consistent with artistic rendering than natural light behavior. The color gradients in the hair appear smooth and do not exhibit fragmented or unrealistic chromatic aberrations, which adds to an aesthetic finish.",

      "question": "Do the stylized bamboo elements in the background maintain their vertical alignment and structural integrity, with soft watercolor textures applied evenly without breaking geometric forms or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized bamboo elements maintain a consistent vertical alignment, critical for their realistic appearance. The watercolor textures applied are soft and even, maintaining the integrity of the bamboo's shape and form. There are no breaks in the geometric form nor do they appear segmented in an unnatural way, ensuring suitability with the overall art style of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-shaped writing spaces and embossed borders placed in non-intrusive areas of the image and do they show consistent depth cues such as subtle shadows and raised textures without appearing flat or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral-shaped writing spaces and embossed borders in Image B are placed in such a way that they do not interfere with the main subject of the image. Depth cues such as subtle shadows and slight raised textures are present, providing a three-dimensional feel. They are appropriately aligned with the overall layout and do not appear flat, ensuring that the attention remains focused on them when intended.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s body is presented with proportions consistent with natural human anatomy. The limbs appear in natural positions without any signs of elongation, and her posture is culturally accurate for someone wearing a kimono, which typically features a gentle, poised stance. There are no visible signs of distortion in her features or unnatural curvature, maintaining lifelike realism.",
