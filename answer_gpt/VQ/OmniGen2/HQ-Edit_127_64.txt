    "Question": "Q1: Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the icons related to seating are integrated into a graphic representation and do not interact with photographic elements as there are no real individuals or objects present. Instead, these icons are part of a digital infographic design, focusing on park etiquette. Therefore, the concepts of shadow casting and real-world integration do not apply here, making the realism question non-applicable.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
    "explanation": "Image B comprises an illustrative diagram designed to convey park etiquette, which features speech bubbles containing icons rather than real human figures. The graphics are positioned in a way that communicates the intended etiquette tips without the presence of real humans. Given this illustrative nature, the considerations involving physical intersections with humans or proportional sizing relative to actual people do not apply.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the camera icon is a representation, part of an etiquette infographic and not meant to physically align with an actual Eiffel Tower silhouette. It does not involve distortion or edge artifacts as it is not required to conform to the structure of the Eiffel Tower within the graphic, indicating it is appropriately scaled and positioned within its context.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical split line in the infographic clearly runs through the center of the stylized pathway depicted in the graphic without intersecting the Eiffel Tower or the hedges. This line is part of a simplified and illustrative framework, which is designed to separate different categories of park etiquette within the graphic.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
    "explanation": "Image B's colors are those of a stylized graphic rather than a photograph, featuring even application of green tones to depict a park environment. Being an illustration, it doesn't display typical photographic issues like color banding or detail loss, nor does it feature a natural sky or leaf texture that could exhibit unnatural saturation. Instead, color decisions seem deliberate and consistent with the illustration style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
