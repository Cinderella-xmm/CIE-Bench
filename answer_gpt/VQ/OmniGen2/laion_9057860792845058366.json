      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the reflections on the robot’s body uniform and physically consistent with a metallic surface, without streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlight areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's body displays reflections consistent with a metallic surface, showcasing smooth and uniform highlights without any streaks. There is no evidence of over-saturation or mismatched highlight areas, which suggests a physically accurate rendering of metallic surfaces. The light interacts with the robot's surface in a manner expected of polished or semi-polished metal, which indicates attention to realistic detail in its depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the holographic display on the chest transparent and layered above the surface without warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a digital overlay around the robot, there is no distinct holographic display specifically on the chest area that is discernible in terms of transparency or layered effects. Thus, despite various digital elements around, there is no visual information directly observed on the chest regarding a display's transparency or correct layering, making it difficult to confirm such attributes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the control icons in the digital interface overlay sharp, readable, and positioned without overlapping key mechanical components such as the shoulders or torso joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital interface overlay, including control icons, appears sharp and readable. They are strategically positioned in the background and do not overlap with key mechanical components such as the robot's shoulders or torso joints. The design ensures the icons are visible and distinct, providing readable interface details without interference from the mechanical structure.",

      "question": "Is the smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm without bending or deforming the arm’s structure, and does it have a clean, seamless connection point consistent with magnetic attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a smartwatch accessory visible on the robot's forearm that could be evaluated for attachment or integration with the arm's structure. As such, there is no evidence or visual cue to assess the smartwatch's interaction with the forearm in terms of bending, deformation, or connection type.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floating tech interface symbols in the background evenly spaced, sharp-edged, and free from jagged outlines or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floating tech interface symbols in the background are seen as evenly spaced and exhibit sharp edges. The symbols do not show signs of jagged outlines or ghosting effects, which suggests a high-quality digital overlay. This indicates careful attention to detail in their rendering and positioning within the composition.",
