    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the sinks and cabinets accurately depicted without any broken or warped shapes in both the top-down and angled side views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which is a vector illustration, the sinks and cabinets are depicted with clean lines. There are no visible artifacts such as broken or warped shapes, as vector images are typically precise in depicting geometric shapes. The appearance of straight, consistent edges suggests that the depiction is accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the shadows and light reflections on the countertop, mirrors, and cabinetry appear natural and consistent with the lighting sources in both the top-down and angled side views?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows simplified vector illustrations of sink objects, which typically do not include detailed shadows and light reflections but use flat colors instead. Therefore, there are no natural shadows or reflections depicted, unlike Image A, which is a real photo with natural lighting effects. The absence of shadows and reflections means they do not appear natural as such elements are not present in the vector illustration.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the texture of the marble countertop and the finish of the white cabinetry remain clear and authentic in both the top-down and angled side views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, as a vector illustration, texture and finish details are generally minimized or abstracted into flat colors without realistic effects. Therefore, the texture of the marble countertop and the finish of the cabinetry do not appear clear or authentic compared to a real photo like Image A where these textures would be visible and detailed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the faucets and fixtures proportionate and correctly positioned relative to the sink basins in both the top-down and angled side views without any distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the faucets and fixtures are illustrated with proportionate sizes relative to the sink basins and are positioned logically within the centerline of the basin. Vector illustrations ensure that items are technically accurate in terms of proportion and positioning, without distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the layout of the top-down view and angled side view logically arranged and spaced to facilitate easy interpretation of the sink structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts multiple sinks each with similar configurations in both top-down and angled side views. The arrangement is clear and spaced adequately to interpret the structure of each sink. The consistent layout helps viewers discern the shape and design of the sinks logically.",
    "answer": "Yes"
