      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D figures inside the snow globe maintain the correct proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figures inside the snow globe are designed with proportions typical of chibi art, which includes a larger head and smaller body. In the edited image, these figures maintain symmetry and balanced proportions according to chibi aesthetics, which indicate that no unnatural geometric distortions are present. Chibi characters often have exaggerated proportions, which are appropriately depicted in the 3D figures here.",

      "question": "Does the light layer of snow on the grass inside the snow globe appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow layer observed on the grass inside the globe provides a soft, realistic texture that complements the scene effectively. It does not introduce any visible artifacts, sharp edges, or inconsistent patterns, thus maintaining a natural look that blends well with the environment depicted in the globe.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snow globe rest naturally on the rustic wooden shelf with soft sunlight filtering through, creating believable warm, golden reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting of the snow globe on the wooden shelf is realistic, and the soft sunlight filtering through the room provides warm reflections that align with the golden hour lighting typically seen in such scenes. The reflections and the ambient light enhance the natural look of the setting without any visual anomalies.",

      "question": "Are the bats propped against the fence inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any distortion or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bats inside the snow globe exhibit a natural cylindrical shape and wood-like texture, consistent with the appearance of real baseball bats. There is no evidence of unnatural distortions or odd textures, and they fit well within the scene, complementing the overall composition.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition from the snow globe's interior to the background scene is seamless and coherent. There are no visible mismatches or discontinuities between the snow globe's environment and the background, indicating smooth integration without artifacts, maintaining the aesthetic charm of a vintage clubhouse setup.",
