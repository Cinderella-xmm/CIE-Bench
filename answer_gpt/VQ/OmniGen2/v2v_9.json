      "question": "Does the creature's body maintain the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the bubble tea cup's shape and texture without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image retains the depiction of a bubble tea cup character with a facial expression, straw, and bubbles or pearls at the bottom. The cup has a clear lid, and there are star-like elements for eyes, with visible shine suggesting a smooth surface. The entire structure maintains the typical shape of a bubble tea cup, without any distortions to its shape or surface texture, indicating a visually coherent and plausible design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the design elements like tapioca pearls and the straw integrated naturally into the creature's form without appearing as unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tapioca pearls are depicted at the bottom of the cup, consistent with real bubble tea. They are presented in a uniform manner that fits the overall cartoon design of the image. The straw is appropriately placed coming out of the lid, aligning with a plausible design for a bubble tea cup and does not appear as an unnatural texture or artifact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the custom orb or capsule near the creature's feet feature patterns and colors consistent with the bubble tea theme without losing fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The custom orb features a pattern with multiple colors, including blue and pink, which are harmonious with the pastel theme of the bubble tea cup's design. These colors are bright and complement the overall visual theme, maintaining a level of detail that keeps consistency with the cartoon-like and playful nature of the artwork.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the creature relative to the custom orb/capsule and the overall scene logically consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions between the bubble tea cup and the custom orb are harmonious, with neither element overpowering the other. Both the bubble tea cup and the orbs are well-scaled and rest naturally within the entire scene, indicating a balanced composition free from any noticeable distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the presentation of the creature's name and elemental type complement the artwork's charm without disrupting the visual flow or introducing distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'MADE NAME' is placed below the cup and is unobtrusively integrated into the lower section of the scene. The font is simplistic and does not clash with the image, allowing the character within the scene to remain the focal point, hence not disrupting the charm or introducing distractions to the visual flow.",
