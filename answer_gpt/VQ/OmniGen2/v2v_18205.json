      "question": "Does the horse's musculature display intricate detail and natural texture without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse appears with smooth and stylized musculature that lacks intricate detail and natural texture typically seen in realistic depictions. The surface appears uniform and highly polished rather than textured, suggesting a deviation from natural textures. This indicates that the horse's portrayal is more stylized and less detailed compared to what would be expected in a naturalistic image.",

      "question": "Are the lighting effects on the horse and elephant consistent with a Renaissance-inspired style and do they enhance the anatomical features naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a smooth and even lighting that emphasizes the forms without much chiaroscuro or subtle shadowing that is characteristic of Renaissance styles. The lighting highlights the shapes but does not create the dramatic contrast typically used to enhance the anatomical features in a Renaissance style. Therefore, the lighting does not naturally enhance anatomical features in the way characteristic of Renaissance artistry.",

      "question": "Does the elephant's skin retain its natural texture and fine details without any visible degradation or unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's skin is presented with a uniform and highly stylized texture, lacking the detailed wrinkles and texture observed in natural elephant skin. The patterns appear repetitive and unnatural, indicating a loss of the expected natural fine detail and texture.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical structure of the horse and elephant appear rational and consistent with their anatomical forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the horse and elephant appear stylized but their proportions and structures remain mostly rational in terms of their respective anatomical forms. The horse's and elephant's physical structures do not exhibit any major distortions that would make them appear unrealistic in terms of anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition of the horse standing on a platform above the elephant visually credible and structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse stands on a flat platform above the elephant, a composition that is fantastical and not practically plausible due to the scale and balance challenges in reality. While the structure appears coherent in the visual depiction, it lacks practical credibility because an elephant's back is not a likely place to support a large platform. Thus, it's visible but not structurally credible.",
