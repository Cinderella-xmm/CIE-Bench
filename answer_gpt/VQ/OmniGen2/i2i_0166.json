      "question": "Does the added poem text blend naturally with the image without causing any visible distortion to the background or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the poem text is placed over a relatively less detailed part of the image, where the background is a gradient of soft colors with no particular texture or objects. The opacity and blending of the text don't seem to modify or distort the details of the background or the bird. Since the text does not interfere with the key visual elements, it appears integrated without causing any distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the poem text is positioned at the bottom of the image, leaving the bird and branch unobstructed. The placement of the text takes advantage of the negative space below the bird, avoiding any significant elements and maintaining the image's compositional structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the font and size of the added poem text appropriate, maintaining readability while not overpowering the natural elements of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font size in Image B is small enough to not dominate the image, yet still has enough contrast against the background to be readable. The typeface is simple and understated, meaning it does not distract from the bird or the background lighting. The text's elegance complements the natural surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the added poem text exhibit a smooth texture that aligns with the lighting and shadow of the original image, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The poem text in Image B has a clear and sharp appearance, with no harsh edges or visible pixelation that would suggest poor alignment with the image's natural lighting. The text color is chosen to balance with the image's tone, helping it achieve an organic fit without producing artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the final composition, including the added poem text, retain a balanced and harmonious visual layout without disrupting the natural feel of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the poem text in Image B integrates well into the overall composition. It is placed in a way that respects the focal points of the bird and branch, while the non-dominant color of the text complements the overall color scheme. The visual flow from the bird to the poem is smooth, retaining a harmonious balance throughout.",
