    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions and physical relationships between the various parts of the rocking chair preserved accurately in the enamel pin design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized representation, the fundamental proportions of the rocking chair - such as the height of the backrest relative to the seat, and the curvature and length of the rockers - are preserved. The now cartoonish design respects these relationships, allowing it to be recognizably a rocking chair.",
