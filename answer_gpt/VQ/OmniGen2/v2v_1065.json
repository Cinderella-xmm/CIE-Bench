      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues from Image B, the 3D figure inside the snow globe captures the skateboarder's mid-action pose in a stylized manner. The chibi style inherently involves disproportionate features, such as a larger head and smaller limbs, and exaggerated postures that may not adhere to realistic proportions or physics. However, these distortions are characteristic of chibi figures, aiming to deliver a cuter and more expressive look rather than real-life accuracy. Hence, given the nature of chibi design, the proportions and physical rationality align with this artistic style, even if not realistic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and ramps within the snow globe are miniaturized elements modeled to fit the small-scale environment of a snow globe. The trees and ramps maintain their shapes and are seamlessly integrated, displaying a smooth transition from the exterior scene to the interior setting. This preserves coherence and eliminates the presence of unnatural textures or broken shapes, making them naturally fit the snow globe scene.",

      "question": "Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the character's clothing and skateboard display details consistent with the chibi style, adjusting textures to suit the miniature depiction inside the snow globe. While some fine details may be simplified in chibi design to fit visual aesthetics, the representation maintains the fundamental appearance and recognizable features of the clothing and skateboard. The portrayal aligns with common practices in such styles, where simplification does not detract from visual quality.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe sitting near the window shows structural solidity, depicted with a smooth, uniform glass encompassing the miniature scene. The reflection and refraction of light through the glass, especially with the sun shining outside, display realistic light scattering effects, contributing to its credibility and integration with the environment. These effects give a natural appearance to the glass dome, reinforcing realism.",

      "question": "Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the snow falling inside the globe with a natural dispersion pattern typical of snow globes. The snow enhances the overall aesthetic by adding motion and a lively atmosphere, while maintaining consistency with the globeâ€™s theme without appearing artificial. Snow flakes tend to settle subtly over features like ramps and the figure, fitting within the confines of the snow globe's scene.",
