        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's raised leg and upper arm appear to maintain a continuous and smooth curvature, which is in line with the elegant lines typically associated with yoga poses.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show the fingers holding the foot, making it difficult to determine if there are exactly five fingers with natural curvature and proper contact. Thus, it cannot be confirmed with certainty.",
