      "question": "Is the horseâ€™s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse's head is larger compared to its body, which is typical for plush toys to emphasize cuteness. The eyes are cartoonishly large and round, and the muzzle is simply styled, maintaining clear definition without distortion. This is consistent with the common design of plush toys where features are exaggerated for appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the body of the plush horse display a consistent fabric texture with soft, non-reflective surfaces and no abrupt transitions between color regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the plush horse is shown with a smooth, consistent fabric texture typical of plush toys. The colors transition smoothly between sections, such as the white and brown areas, without any abrupt or harsh lines that suggest a break in fabric texture. This uniformity in texture is characteristic of such manufactured plush items.",

      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the plush horse depicted with visible stitching patterns and raised texture consistent with embroidery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and mouth of the plush horse are designed to appear flat and cartoonish, which is common in plush toys. They lack visible stitching patterns or raised textures typical of embroidery. Instead, they are smooth and integrated into the fabric, suggesting a printed or painted design rather than stitched embroidery.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse's legs are designed to be short and thick, with a smooth, rounded shape, consistent with the structure of plush toys. There is no evidence of distortion or breakage in the geometry of the legs, keeping with the simplistic and soft design typical of plush toy craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Are the dandelions in the foreground composed of flat, circular felt-like discs on straight stems, lacking naturalistic detail or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dandelions appear as simple, circular shapes on straight stems, reminiscent of felt or fabric embellishments often used in decorative plush setups or toyscapes. These dandelions lack intricate, realistic detailing or depth, aligning with the style of simplistic, decorative elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest background consists of stylized, flat tree forms, typical of illustrative or toy settings where detail is minimized for effect. There are no significant depth cues such as overlapping or fading with distance, making the background appear flat and lacking atmospheric perspective.",
