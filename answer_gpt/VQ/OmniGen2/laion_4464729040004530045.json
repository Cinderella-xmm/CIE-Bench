      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bodice and skirt exhibit natural fabric folds and draping consistent with the weight and volume of Victorian-era garments, especially at the waist and hip regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bodice and skirt appear to be Victorian-inspired with a structured bodice, puffed sleeves, and a full skirt that naturally drapes. The fabric shows realistic folds and pleats, particularly around the waist, suggesting authenticity in garment weight and volume typical of the Victorian era. This observation uses world knowledge about historical fashion and fabric behavior.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the floral pattern on the skirt seems evenly spaced with no obvious signs of repetition or artifacting such as pixelation or unexpected color shifts. The flowers are uniformly distributed, maintaining the aesthetic integrity of typical fabric patterns. This involves inspecting the image closely for digital imperfections.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the subject is seamlessly integrated into the garden setting. There are no visible seams or ghosting effects around the edges, which would indicate poor editing or unrealistic placement. This involves observing the transition between the subject and the background for any discrepancies.",
