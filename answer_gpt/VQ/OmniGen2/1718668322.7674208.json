    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoulder and chest armor in Image B have a metallic silver appearance. The texture captures light realistically with highlights and shadows that provide a sense of depth. The light reflects off of the curved surfaces naturally, avoiding a flat or overly shiny look, which aligns with the expected properties of polished metal.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor appears to be well-fitted to the figure it covers. The joints, especially around the arm and the chest, are aligned with typical human anatomy. There are no noticeable gaps or distortions, and the design follows the contours of the body in a plausible manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair in Image B exhibits a vibrant blue and yellow color scheme with smooth gradients. The strands appear consistent and continuous, reflecting light similarly to how metallic wires might, maintaining their flow throughout without unnatural breaks or clumps.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background that is a consistent and neutral gray. There are no visible artifacts or remnants that suggest the presence of the original background. The lighting on the subject is even, not causing any significant deviations in the background tone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions between the armor, hair, and background appear smooth and cohesive. There are no visible signs of pixelation or mismatched edges. The integration of these elements creates a harmonious image with no discernible artifacts.",
