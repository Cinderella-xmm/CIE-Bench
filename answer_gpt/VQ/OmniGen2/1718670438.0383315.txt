    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?",
    "explanation": "The glass bell jar in Image B appears to be pristine, with clear surfaces enabling natural reflections and refractions. These optical qualities should not distort the robot's form inside, allowing its structure to appear undisturbed. This is consistent with the typical attributes expected of quality glass, which is clear and smooth without causing distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
