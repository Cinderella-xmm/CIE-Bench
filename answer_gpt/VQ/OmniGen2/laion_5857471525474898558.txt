    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO-style bricks on the building facade uniformly sized, aligned in rows, and free from visible texture repetition or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building facade is constructed using LEGO-style bricks, which are typically characterized by a uniform size and arranged in a row-by-row alignment. The visual cues do not indicate any texture repetition or blurring, as LEGO bricks inherently maintain a uniform texture when digitally rendered. Therefore, the building appears well-constructed and visually coherent without flaws in texture repetition or orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the window frames appear as solid, blocky LEGO elements with consistent thickness and alignment, matching the original window positions and sizes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames are constructed using LEGO bricks, giving them a blocky appearance with consistent thickness. These frames follow the same placement and proportion as observed in a LEGO-themed model, maintaining the original window positions and sizes from Image A by aligning correctly with the overall architectural layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the green LEGO vines grow along the same vertical paths as the original plants, maintaining segmented, blocky forms without stretching or breaking continuity?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows green LEGO bricks arranged vertically, mimicking the original vines in Image A. The LEGO elements are segmented and blocky, typical of LEGO designs, aligning with the original vertical growth paths of the plants and maintaining continuous form without stretching.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the gray LEGO railings on each balcony evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and securely connected to the balcony base without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "The gray railings in Image B are visible as evenly spaced and horizontally aligned LEGO elements, designed to mimic traditional architectural railings. They appear securely attached to their respective balcony bases, indicating proper design construction without issues like floating or overlapping.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a flat, level platform extending beneath the entire building base, positioned consistently with the sidewalk and not overlapping with parked vehicles?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a LEGO constructed model, often placed on a baseplate. The base beneath the building appears flat and level, which is consistent with the typical layout of such models. It does not interfere or overlap with nearby vehicles, maintaining a separation consistent with real-world positioning relative to sidewalks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do all architectural elements—including windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—remain in their original positions and maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to one another?",
    "explanation": "The architectural elements of Image B, represented in LEGO style, maintain their relative positions and alignment found in Image A, such as window placement, balcony spacing, and roofline alignment. This reflects consistency in design from the original image while transforming the materials to LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders between the LEGO building and the sky, trees, or parked cars?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the LEGO building is digitally rendered, and typically less prone to issues like color bleeding or sharp edges seen in real objects. The border between the LEGO structure, the sky, and the parked vehicle appears clean, with no visible seams or color inconsistencies, thanks to the clean-cut design elements in LEGO construction.",
    "answer": "No"
