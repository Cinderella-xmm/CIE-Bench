    "Question": "Q2: Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",
    "explanation": "The bear in the image does not exhibit any facial expression changes or depiction of aging features. Its face is blurred, which makes it impossible to determine any detailed expressions or specific features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
    "explanation": "The speech bubble is positioned above and to the left of the bear, but the connection to the bear's mouth is not clear as the face is blurred. While it may not distort fur directly, its positioning doesn't visually connect to the speech source, leading to a disconnected appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
    "explanation": "The transformation chart is positioned in a separate panel adjacent to the bear’s image and is not physically within the bear's mouth. Thus, the question about the chart fitting naturally within the mouth is not applicable to this image setup.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
    "explanation": "The labeled stages in the chart float above the river surface without exhibiting natural interactions like casting shadows or adhering to depth cues. This detachment from the scene disrupts a realistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
    "explanation": "The fact box is located at the bottom of each panel, distinct from the main scenic elements, and doesn’t cover significant details like tree trunks or water flow, maintaining clarity of the core visual components.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The text in the speech bubble and fact box exhibits irregularities and distortions, such as overlapping letters and awkward spacing, indicating potential pixelation or artifacts that detract from the overall clarity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
