      "question": "Do both hands of the elderly gentleman have exactly five fingers each, with natural spacing and joint alignment consistent with human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an analysis of the gentleman's hands is conducted by observing the visual representation. The cartoon style might simplify or exaggerate features, but the image clearly depicts a thumb and four fingers on each hand, spaced and aligned as would be expected in humanoid anatomy. Without evidence to suggest deviation from typical human anatomy, the conclusion is based on the artistic depiction of the hands.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the size of the newspaper proportionate to the man’s body such that it rests naturally on his lap and is fully supported by his hands without appearing to float or exceed physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the newspaper appears larger relative to the man’s body than a typical newspaper would. It looks oversized, extending significantly beyond what would be considered normal proportions of being comfortably held. The cartoon style might exaggerate dimensions for effect, leading to a sense of a floating appearance rather than natural positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the thought bubble placed adjacent to the man’s head without overlapping any part of his face or hair, and does it have a smooth, closed outline without jagged or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubble is positioned above and adjacent to the gentleman's head. The bubble does not overlap with his face or hair, maintaining adjacency as typical in illustrations to convey thought. The outline of the bubble is smooth, closed, and without any signs of jagged or broken edges, adhering to conventional cartoon visual styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and foliage in the background rendered with consistent, non-warped geometry and uniform texture, without floating leaves or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and foliage follow a stylized, cartoonish pattern. While the geometry and textures are consistent within this artistic framework, the non-realistic rendering lacks complicated shapes such as floating leaves or broken forms. The simplicity and uniformity are typical of cartoon backgrounds.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the textured cardstock effect visible across the entire image without distorting fine details like facial lines, clothing seams, or newspaper content, and are the pastel colors evenly distributed without causing color bleed or shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a flat, illustrative style typical of cartoons, lacking a textured cardstock effect. This style inherently doesn't distort fine details such as facial lines or seam specificity. Colors are applied in uniform blocks without bleeding into one another, which complements the straightforward color palette of pastel shades. Therefore, there are no distortions or irregularities in color distribution.",
