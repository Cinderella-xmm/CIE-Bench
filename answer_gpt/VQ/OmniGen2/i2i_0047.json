      "question": "Does the transition between the train and the cyberpunk background appear seamless without obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating Image B, the transition between the train and the cyberpunk background needs to be assessed for smoothness and coherence. The train is set within a vividly lit, neon cityscape, typical of the cyberpunk genre. The background features colorful buildings and bright signs, which are consistent with a neon-lit setting. The absence of artifacts or noticeable discontinuities where the train meets the background suggests a seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections of neon lights on the train surface realistic and consistent with the expected behavior of light in a cyberpunk setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image portrays neon lights reflecting off various surfaces, expected in a cyberpunk context. The colors and brightness are consistent, likely using retouching techniques that match the vivid luminosity of cyberpunk neon lights. The reflection on the train surfaces appears blended well into the image and aligns with how light would behave in such environments.",

      "question": "Do the added headphones on the driver look natural and do they preserve the driver's visibility without obscuring important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headphones are added to the person sitting atop the train. The placement of headphones around the head is typical, and they do not obstruct key aspects of the person's visage or figure. The headphones seem proportionate and appropriately positioned, contributing to the visibility of the individualâ€™s other features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the motion blur effect applied in a way that suggests movement without causing the train to appear distorted or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, there's an apparent application of motion blur to represent speed and movement, a common technique in dynamic scenes. The train's form remains clear, indicating that the effect successfully conveys motion without compromising the structural details of the train. The blurring aligns with the direction of motion typically portrayed in creative edits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall transformed image maintain a consistent edgy and cool style without introducing conflicting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is styled consistent with the cyberpunk theme, characterized by neon colors and modern elements like the futuristic city backdrop and added personal gadgets (e.g., headphones). No elements seem out of place; the integration maintains an edgy, coherent style typically associated with cyberpunk aesthetics.",
