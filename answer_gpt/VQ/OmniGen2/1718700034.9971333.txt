    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are formed by crystal shards that appear to be symmetrically aligned. They have a structured and coherent look, with the facets evenly placed and without noticeable gaps or distortions. This symmetry is judged by the uniform repetition of the geometric shapes on both sides of the body, suggesting a harmonious and well-constructed design.",
