    {

      "question": "Do the annotated lines representing the tea journey follow a smooth, non-intersecting path around the tea set without overlapping or deforming the original objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the annotated lines connect different elements of the tea journey. These lines are visually examined to check if they smoothly navigate around objects, maintaining their intended path without intersecting or going over the teapot, cups, or vase inappropriately. The image exhibits these lines joining elements like the teapot and cups without deformation or unintended overlap, which suggests a careful integration respecting the composition and avoiding interference with physical objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the handwritten calligraphy in soft pastel green seamlessly integrated into the scene without causing visual contrast or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten elements in Image B are in pastel green, inspecting their integration into the scene involves assessing how they merge with the background and adjacent colors. The text must blend without creating harsh contrast or visible artifacts that disrupt the coherence of the artwork. The pastel green is soft and compliments the surrounding palette, which assists in creating a visually harmonious image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the minimalist icons for each step of the tea journey proportionally scaled and visually coherent with the surrounding objects and layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the minimalist icons represent steps within the tea journey. Ensuring proportional scaling and coherence involves comparing their sizes relative to similarly sized objects like the teapot and cups. These icons are aptly scaled to match the surrounding elements, and their design quickly conveys key steps without appearing disproportionate or disjointed in layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added cherry blossom petals appear to float or fall naturally in the air without unnatural positioning or missing shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cherry blossom petals are dispersed in the air, their natural appearance depends on their position, orientation, and the presence of shadows consistent with environmental lighting. The petals are positioned to mimic natural descent, with some gentle curvature suggesting movement, thus preserving a believable appearance without suffering from unnatural placement or shadow omission.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase preserved without visible distortion, blurring, or artificial seams where new elements were added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image includes a table mat, teapot, cup, and vase upon which new elements like text and icons are superimposed. Observing for preservation involves checking for any distortions or blurring introduced by these additions. The original textures and detail are maintained without apparent alteration or seam artifacts resulting from the editing, preserving overall visual quality.",
