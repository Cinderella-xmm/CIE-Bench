      "question": "Does the tall glass on the right display consistent pixelated and circuit-like textures across its surface without visible cracks, jagged edges, or inconsistent rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass has a consistent pattern of circuit-like textures with clear pixelation on its surface, indicating a digital or holographic theme. The image shows smooth edges and lacks any visible defects like cracks or inconsistencies, suggesting a controlled and intentional design. This observation is based solely on the clear and uninterrupted lines visible in the image.",

      "question": "Are the outlines of the Sydney Opera House composed of continuous, evenly spaced neon lines that maintain the correct number and shape of the shell structures without misalignment or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the Sydney Opera House are depicted with bright neon lines. The structure's iconic shell shapes maintain their integrity with no apparent misalignment or gaps within the neon outlines. This conclusion is drawn from the visual continuity and precision in the neon lines tracing the well-known architectural form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns in the water consist of uniform, repeating geometric shapes that align horizontally and vertically without overlapping irregularly or creating gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wave patterns in Image B are characterized by a series of uniform, glowing lines depicting stylized water waves. These shapes align smoothly, creating a consistent pattern with no visible irregular overlaps or gaps. The uniformity of the waves' alignment and the continuous flow indicates an intentional design choice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the beverage in the shorter glass show a consistent holographic effect with subtle layering and refraction, without distorting the shape of the ice cubes or causing unnatural transparency gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beverage inside the shorter glass features a dynamic, illuminated look with a holographic effect. The ice cubes appear well-defined, and there is a subtle sense of layering and light refraction present. This effect does not distort the ice cubes' appearance or introduce unnatural transparency gradients, suggesting a coherent holographic presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the two glasses aligned with the direction of the sunset lighting, and do they match the apparent position of the sun in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, it appears that the lighting setup exhibits a digital and neon aesthetic, where the placement and style are not comparable to real-world sunset conditions. The shadows in this context appear to be part of an abstract design rather than a representation of natural lighting given the neon theme, hence they do not necessarily align with the physical lighting of a sunset.",
