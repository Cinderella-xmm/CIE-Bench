      "question": "Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is adorned with additional embellishments such as enchanted vines that align well with the tower's lattice structure. They appear smooth and continuous, maintaining a consistent thickness, which indicates careful integration with the tower's design. Comparing this with Image A, which features only the traditional lattice work of the Eiffel Tower, the alignment in Image B corresponds well to the structural lines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows glowing floral motifs on the Eiffel Tower. The light they emit is consistent, and they blend harmoniously with the ambient sunset lighting, without harsh brightness transitions or isolated bright spots. This provides a cohesive visual appearance and an enchanting atmosphere. Image A does not contain these motifs, showing only the sunset backdrop.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an ancient stone platform beneath the Eiffel Tower, integrated well with its base. It appears proportionate to the tower's legs and is symmetrically placed, demonstrating neither warping nor misalignment issues. Compared to Image A, which shows a typical landscape base, the stone platform in Image B fits naturally without disrupting the overall composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arcane symbols on the stone platform in Image B are methodically placed, evenly spaced, and correctly oriented. They exhibit depth through shadowing effects, simulating a carved appearance. Though Image A does not include these symbols, the presentation in Image B convincingly conveys an ancient and mystical quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the towerâ€™s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky includes magical nebulae that organically flow from the base upward, seamlessly blending with the existing orange gradient. The effect is smooth and continuous, lacking sharp or disjointed sections. Image A presents a simpler sky gradient without these nebulae, making the mystical transitions in Image B distinctive and integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a crystal pinnacle on the Eiffel Tower, characterized by clearly defined, reflective facets. These facets catch ambient light effectively, displaying subtle refractions that enhance their clarity without any blurring or distortion. In comparison, Image A does not include such a feature, so the distinct representation in Image B stands out.",
