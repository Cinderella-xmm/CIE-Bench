      "question": "Do the stained glass wings feature consistent, smooth patterns without jagged edges or pixelated textures, and do they appear to transmit light naturally as if made of glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stained glass wings in Image B are shown with smooth transitions and intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of real stained glass. The colors are vibrant and the patterns exhibit a consistent design without breaks or pixelation. The lighting suggests a natural transmission through the wings, akin to sunlight passing through stained glass, which is a common characteristic of such materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dress composed of leaf-like and vine-like elements that maintain natural curvature, shading, and thickness, with no visible seams or synthetic textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B appears to be a collection of leaves arranged intricately. These leaves show natural curvature and texture, with appropriate shadows and highlights that suggest realistic thickness. The design avoids seams or artificial textures, closely resembling the organic form of natural leaves.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mushrooms and twinkling fireflies integrated into the background with consistent lighting and depth, avoiding floating or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing mushrooms and twinkling fireflies are seamlessly integrated into the forest setting. The lighting of these elements is coherent with the ambient light in the scene, giving an impression of depth and consistency. There are no visual cues suggesting they are out of place or floating unnaturally within the composition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B exhibit five fingers each with natural joint alignment, typical of human anatomy. The skin texture is smooth, showing no signs of distortion, additional digits, or abnormalities.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question pertains to the second image (Image B), which actually shows the subject standing, not seated. The legs are presented with natural posture appropriate for a standing position, with correct proportions and no signs of elongation or compression.",
