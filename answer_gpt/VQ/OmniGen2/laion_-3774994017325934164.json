    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s head is larger in proportion to the body, typical of stylized cartoon or chibi figures. The body proportions align smoothly with the artistic style, maintaining coherence in limb and torso alignment without distortions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the character’s suit evenly distributed, free from repeating tiles or jagged edges, and do they follow a logical direction consistent with fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B features vibrant and well-distributed patterns that smoothly cover the fabric, following logical lines that mimic natural clothing draping. There are no evident repeating tiles or jagged edges in the design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the oversized glasses fully rendered with clear lenses and frames, aligned with the eye region, and without partial transparency or clipping against facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The description does not mention oversized glasses, hence we can presume there are none present or visible in Image B. This absence of glasses means there's no issue with rendering or alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand have exactly five fingers, with natural curvature and spacing, and are there no distorted knuckles, extra digits, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B is carefully rendered with the correct number of five fingers. Each digit shows natural curvature and spacing, reflecting accurate human anatomy without any distortion or strange shadowing effects.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned at plausible distances, casting soft shadows, and aligned with the character’s perspective without floating above ground or appearing detached?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers and balloons appear at appropriate distances within the background. They are rendered to match the perspective of the scene, contributing to a cohesive environment without appearing detached or floating unnaturally.",
