      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or missing details where the vase is replaced with floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral elements present a consistent and uniform texture across the entire arrangement. The flowers are depicted with vibrant colors and well-defined details, which suggest no signs of awkward textures or missing details. The flowers appear complete and natural, with detailed petals and leaves, maintaining a realistic appearance. Based on this observation, there are no noticeable gaps or disparities that would imply unnatural textures or omissions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral elements replacing the vase maintain proper proportions and avoid distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral elements in Image B follow a balanced composition, with blooms of similar size creating a harmonious arrangement. The flowers maintain natural proportions and appear symmetrical and undistorted, similar to how flowers naturally grow and are arranged in a vase. Therefore, there are no distorted shapes or disproportionate features, suggesting that the proportions are well-maintained.",

      "question": "Does the floral transformation retain structural consistency and blend naturally with the original vase shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral arrangement assumes a vase-like structure, with the flowers projecting from the top of the container while maintaining a bouquet-like form. The structure remains consistent, resembling the silhouette of a traditional floral arrangement in a round-bottomed vase. The transition in shape is smooth, maintaining a coherent structure, indicating that the transformation blends naturally while preserving the essence of a vase.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the vase and floral elements seamless without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals a smooth and seamless transition between the container (acting as a vase base) and the floral arrangement. The base serves as the foundation for the flowers, and there are no visible editing marks or artifacts indicating a disjointed connection. The integration is neat, suggesting that the transition between different visual elements is executed seamlessly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of flowers in the vase-like structure appear natural and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral arrangement appears well-organized, with flowers evenly distributed and oriented in a way that mimics a natural bouquet. The placement is aesthetically pleasing, and each bloom fits into the overall pattern without appearing artificial or forced. The arrangement aligns with natural floral design principles, portraying a credible and visually satisfying appearance.",
