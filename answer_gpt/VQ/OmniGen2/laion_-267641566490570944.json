    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal horns on the dragon head proportionally sized relative to the mountain peak and do they exhibit natural refraction and transparency consistent with crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's horns are noticeably large, but they align proportionately with the dragonâ€™s hefty size relative to the mountain peaks, matching the concept of a mythical creature. Combining my world knowledge that crystalline materials typically exhibit transparency and refraction, it seems the horns are not transparent or refractive, but rather have a matte finish resembling scales more than crystals. Therefore, the horns do not exhibit characteristics of crystalline material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ridge lines forming the dragon body show smooth, flowing transitions without abrupt angular bends or disproportionate thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the dragon's body displays a consistent thickness and seems to flow smoothly with the curves of the landscape, following a coherent and serpentine form typical of depictions of dragons. No abrupt angular bends are evident, demonstrating an artistic representation of a mythical creature with naturally flowing lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky scales and moss-covered spines distributed in a way that mimics natural erosion and plant growth patterns without repeating textures or uniform spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's scales appear to have a consistent distribution mimicking natural patterns, and the moss-covered spines are irregular and organic, similar to how real moss would grow in nature. There doesn't seem to be any repeated textures or uniform spacing that would make it look artificial. The depiction aligns well with natural erosion and growth tendencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dragon tail fade into the mist with a soft gradient, maintaining visibility of form through haze without sharp cutoffs or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dragon's tail seamlessly blending into the mist, maintaining the form's visibility with a natural gradient as it recedes into the distance. There are no abrupt cutoffs or segments appearing as detached or floating, ensuring a cohesive integration with the mist.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon features align with the sun's position in the sky and match the lighting on surrounding mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sun in Image B is positioned in a way that casts light from the top left corner, creating highlights and shadows on the dragon consistent with this lighting source. The dragon's features reflect a similar lighting pattern as the mountains, suggesting a careful consideration of light direction and the corresponding shadow effects.",
