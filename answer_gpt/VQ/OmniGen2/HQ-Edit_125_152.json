      "question": "Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wing’s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings maintain their natural vein lines across the orange sections. There are no visible sheet music patterns integrated into the orange sections of the wings, and they appear consistent with natural Monarch butterfly wings. The wing texture appears smooth without any visible artifacts. This analysis combines an understanding of Monarch butterflies' wing structures, which lack sheet music patterns, with a close examination of the image's texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the antennae of the butterfly extend smoothly and appear to curve naturally. They do not have any visible kinks or breaks, and their length appears proportionate to the size of the butterfly. This observation relies on the understanding of typical butterfly anatomy where the antennae usually have a smooth curve and are proportionately aligned with the body.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents flowers with petals in various colors. Upon inspection, the petals of these flowers do not resemble musical notes; instead, they maintain a natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals found in flowers like zinnias and daisies. This analysis is done by understanding typical flower petal shapes and recognizing there is no transformation of petals into musical note patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is centrally placed among an array of flowers forming a circular pattern. The flowers are evenly distributed around the butterfly, contributing to a balanced composition. This observation is based on recognizing symmetrical designs in art, where elements are equidistantly arranged around a central focal point such as the butterfly here, contributing to overall harmony in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text rendered with smooth, continuous strokes and no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text ‘Moniard’s Garden Symphony’ in Image B is rendered with smooth, continuous strokes. Close examination of the typography reveals neatly formed letters without jagged edges or aliasing. This analysis combines a fundamental understanding of typography where smooth curves and clean line renderings indicate high-quality text setup.",
