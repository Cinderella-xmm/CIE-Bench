      "question": "Does the transformed woven surface of the handbag display a consistent, seamless scale pattern that follows the bag's contours without visible distortions or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woven surface is altered to have a scale-like pattern. The pattern follows the bag's contours with consistent and seamless texture, similar to scales, without visible distortions or gaps. This can be observed through the uniformity in the design and the way it adapts to the curves of the bag, ensuring no interruptions or inaccuracies in the texture.",

      "question": "Are the modified gray ribbons shaped into wings with smooth, symmetrical curves and natural fabric draping that match the original material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gray ribbons in Image B retain their appearance as in the original image, with smooth and symmetrical curves that resemble wings. The fabric is naturally draped without any irregularities, maintaining the integrity of the material, as initially observed in Image A. The ribbons have smooth transitions and precise contours that match the characteristics of the original ribbon material.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the white flowers have added eyelash-like details that are evenly distributed and seamlessly blended into the petal edges without breaking the flowerâ€™s natural shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there are no visible changes or additions of eyelash-like details on the white flowers. The flowers maintain their natural shape and texture without any modifications to the petal edges. Comparison with Image A confirms that the flowers in both images retain their original form and detailing.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added antennas positioned near the top of the handle with a clear point of attachment and do they exhibit subtle sparkle effects without overlapping or distorting surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antennas in Image B are placed near the top of the handbag handle. They have a clear point of attachment without causing distortion or overlap on surrounding areas. The sparkle effects are subtle and enhance the aesthetic without distracting from the overall image. This positioning and effect maintain a coherent visual without affecting nearby elements like the handle or ribbons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the modified chain forming a continuous, curved tail underneath the bag that retains metallic texture and does not intersect or float above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chain is transformed into a tail-like structure that curves smoothly underneath the bag. It retains a metallic texture visible in the reflective surface, and it follows the contour of the table surface without floating or intersecting incorrectly. This transformation is observed as a seamless and logical extension of the chain positioned beneath the handbag.",
