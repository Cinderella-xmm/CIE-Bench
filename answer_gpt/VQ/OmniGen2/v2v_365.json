      "question": "Does the shell maintain its original pattern and texture without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation of the shell suggests a cartoonish interpretation rather than a realistic depiction. This indicates that there is a departure from the original pattern and texture found in realistic turtle shells, and it lacks the fine details seen in nature. Therefore, it does not maintain its original realistic pattern and texture.",

      "question": "Are the added clothing items and accessories such as glasses, sketchbook, and footwear integrated seamlessly without causing any distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon character is designed with clothing items and accessories like glasses and footwear. The integration appears seamless, without noticeable distortion or awkward blending with the turtle's body. The design and textures are consistent with the animated style and match the character's overall aesthetic, showing no obvious texture issues.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the long legs of the turtle appear structurally coherent and physically rational, avoiding any unnatural bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the turtle is represented as a chibi anthropomorphic character, which inherently allows for stylized and exaggerated proportions, like longer legs. However, within the context of its cartoonish design, these features appear intentional and coherent, fitting within the expectations for such character designs, avoiding unnatural appearances.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, accessories like the scarf and bags are proportionate to the character's size and are designed to complement the cartoonish style. They are well-placed and seamlessly integrated into the character without introducing visual artifacts or incongruence, contributing positively to the character's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a solid orange color that maintains consistency across the image. This color harmonizes with the character's green and earth tones, creating a bright and pleasing contrast that enhances the overall visual appearance. The absence of gradients or texture artifacts contributes to this aesthetic.",
