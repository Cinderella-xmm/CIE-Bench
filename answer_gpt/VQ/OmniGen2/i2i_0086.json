      "question": "Does the golden butterfly appear naturally lit and integrated into the scene without disrupting the existing light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly appears prominently with its own source of light or reflection that matches the warm tones from the existing light sources surrounding the mirror. This integration creates a visually harmonious scene without any clashes or obvious disruptions. However, its illumination seems distinct and could be perceived as separate from the original lighting set up, indicating some level of disruption or extra focus due to its brightness compared to the scene hues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the material and texture of the golden butterfly consistent with the surrounding surfaces, avoiding any visible unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly has been edited onto the visual space with a shiny gold texture. This texture contrasts with the matte finishes and natural surfaces surrounding it, such as the marble tiles and dark fixtures, creating a noticeable difference in material type and surface reflection. This inconsistency in texture can be visually interpreted as unnatural within the existing setting decor.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shape of the golden butterfly structurally coherent and free from distortion, maintaining proper geometry as it appears above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the butterfly retains a classic symmetrical shape characteristic of butterflies, which follows natural geometry. The edges, wings, and overall structure appear correctly shaped and free from distortion, maintaining the expected form, contributing positively to the image's composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the position of the golden butterfly above the mirror contribute positively to the overall composition without creating visual discontinuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned centrally above the mirror, which could draw attention away from the existing visual flow but doesn't disrupt the balance of the composition. It occupies space that naturally draws the viewer's eye, yet maintains the format's integrity without overtly creating discontinuity in the overall bathroom design layout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the golden butterfly been preserved, ensuring clarity and sharpness in comparison to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly shows additional detailing such as fine veins and textures that reflect light convincingly, maintaining clarity and sharpness relative to the surrounding environment. The attention to detail enhances the butterfly's realism even amidst other high-quality elements present, aligning with the image's overall crispness.",
