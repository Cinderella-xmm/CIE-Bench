      "question": "Are the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the transformed necklace clearly defined and free from geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the necklace appear intricately detailed with precise craftsmanship. The patterns and gemstones are well-defined, with no visible distortions in their geometry. This suggests careful attention to maintaining visual integrity in the transformation process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original scaly texture and smooth curvature as it emerges from the mossy bank without sudden breaks or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snake tail in Image B retains a scaly texture and smooth curvature. As it emerges from the mossy environment, there are no abrupt breaks or unnatural bends visible. This suggests that the integration with the bank is smooth and natural without compromising the snakeâ€™s organic form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually transparent with consistent reflections and refractions across its surface, showing no jagged edges or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is visually transparent and shows consistent reflections and refractions across its surface. There are no jagged edges or signs of digital artifacts, indicating that the glass effect has been rendered smoothly and naturally.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the emerald pond display natural water surface details such as subtle ripples and reflections, and are the silver leaves evenly shaped with consistent metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emerald pond displays a glossy surface with subtle reflections, which mimic natural water characteristics. The silver leaves are evenly shaped and exhibit consistent metallic highlights as expected from well-rendered metal objects.",

      "question": "Are the ornate branches supporting the chandelier proportionally sized and shaped to resemble natural plant structures without angular breaks or unnatural joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches supporting the chandelier in Image B are ornate and proportionally sized. They are shaped in a way that closely resembles natural plant structures, devoid of angular breaks or unnatural joints, suggesting a coherent and natural alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the new elements (pond, leaves, branches, dome) properly overlap and interact with the original necklace and snake tail without floating disjointedly or violating depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The new elements such as the pond, leaves, branches, and dome in Image B are integrated well with the original necklace and snake tail. They do not float disjointedly and adhere to depth cues properly, creating a coherent visual scene where all elements interact seamlessly.",
