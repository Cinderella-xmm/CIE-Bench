    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the chibi-style 3D models seamlessly integrated with the photorealistic background without visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D models are positioned against a realistic backdrop of a tropical setting. To determine if the integration is seamless, I look for consistent lighting, shadowing, and edge blending between the characters and the background. The smooth transition without visible mismatches or artifacts suggests that the integration is seamless. The visual cues do not indicate any harsh outlines or inconsistent shadows, which strengthens the impression of a natural integration.",
