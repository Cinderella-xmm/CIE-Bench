    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome have natural transparency and refraction effects that match the lighting direction and shadow patterns from the window, without visible artifacts such as uneven edges or unrealistic glare?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is examined for its transparency and how it interacts with light. The glass should refract and transmit light in a manner consistent with its material properties. The lighting in the scene seems soft and natural, with highlights and shadows in expected places, suggesting the dome is properly integrated without errors like uneven edges or glaring artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the vintage wooden base visually consistent in color, texture, and grain pattern with the surrounding wooden table, and does the velvet lining appear soft and layered without pixelation or unnatural sheen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base matches the table in terms of its brown tones and the grain pattern, creating consistency in the scene's aesthetics. The velvet lining seems plush and has a realistic appearance, lacking pixelation or odd reflections, suggesting it is well-rendered and consistent with the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid grow in a way that follows natural botanical form and maintains contact with the teapot's surface without floating or breaking geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, flowering plants and ferns do not appear to emerge awkwardly from the spout or lid. Instead, they are positioned beneath the dome, not attached to the teapot, aligning with the natural form of botanical growth and ensuring no floating elements disrupt the geometric continuity of the scene.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the butterflies positioned at plausible flight heights and angles near the floral engravings, with visible wings and body details that match the scale and lighting of the scene, and do they cast subtle shadows on the teapot surface?",
    "explanation": "The butterflies in Image B appear at realistic heights and angles, relative to the teapot's elegant engravings. Their wings and bodies are detailed and lit appropriately for their scale in relation to the teapot and surrounding elements. However, there is no evidence of shadows cast on the teapot by the butterflies, which could be a natural part of their interaction with the scene's lighting.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all newly added elements rendered in muted earth tones that blend seamlessly with the original silver teapot and wooden background, avoiding bright or jarring color contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the introduction of butterflies, floral elements, and the glass dome maintains a palette that complements the muted, earthy ambiance of the teapot and surrounding environment. There are no bright colors that starkly contrast against the silver tones of the teapot or the wood texture, suggesting careful color coordination.",
    "answer": "Yes"
