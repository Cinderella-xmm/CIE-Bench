      "question": "Does the surface of the piano exhibit a uniform caramel color with visible white and gold icing details that resemble real edible decoration, without unnatural textures or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano has a surface with a uniform caramel color, and there are visible white decorative lines on the lid, resembling icing used in confectionery. The surface texture appears smooth without digital artifacts or unnatural textures, aligning with the aesthetics of a candy or dessert item.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and spatial relationships of the pianoâ€™s components (lid, body, legs, pedals) preserved and correctly aligned, with no visible deformation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the proportions between the piano lid, body, legs, and pedals maintain a realistic and proportional appearance reminiscent of a grand piano shape. The components align correctly, with no visible distortion or misalignment, ensuring an accurate representation of a miniaturized edible piano.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't depict seamless color transitions from black to caramel because the piano is entirely in a caramel color suggesting a candy-like design, unlike the black color seen in Image A. The lighting does interact naturally, but there is no transition from black to caramel in this design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the keys appear as distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard, with no missing or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano keys appear as distinct, uniformly shaped elements, resembling sugar crystals or candy. They are arranged in a regular pattern with no visible elements missing or misaligned, indicating careful design to mimic realistic piano keys in a confectionery style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white marble tabletop beneath the piano flat, properly scaled, and displaying natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble tabletop in Image B appears flat and properly scaled relative to the piano. It displays natural stone patterns as expected of marble surfaces. The light interactions appear consistent, aligning with the expectations of how light emits from above in a room setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the piano and its decorative details are sharp and clean, illustrating clearly defined boundaries without pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending. The quality suggests high-resolution rendering appropriate for designed imagery.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows on the marble tabletop are consistent with the direction of light that also appears in the image. The shadows are soft and naturally diffused, reflecting the light setup akin to the room scene, demonstrating consistent light behavior.",
