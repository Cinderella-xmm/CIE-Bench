      "question": "Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the miniature robot model visually appears to have well-preserved proportions and intact geometric shapes. The joints and segments seem to align properly without signs of distortion such as stretching or compression. Comparing to Image A, the original robot's proportions and shapes are similarly preserved in the model form, maintaining consistency across both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case enclosing the miniature robot appears transparent, allowing for visibility of the robot inside clearly. The surface reflects light naturally, showing smooth curves without jagged edges or artifacts. The overall look suggests refined transparency and smoothness typical of glass or high-quality plastic.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robotâ€™s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visibly showcase any tiny gears under transparent panels that require assessment of alignment or overlapping. Thus, the question regarding tiny gears does not apply to any visible elements present in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hexagonal base is geometrically structured with precise uniform edges and a matte-black finish that appears consistent. The model number text is sharp and emits an even glow, devoid of distortion or halo effects, showcasing clarity and design precision.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mini landscape that includes scaled representations of trees, ground textures, and a distant cityscape. The elements appear appropriately miniaturized to fit the size of the display case and model, maintaining spatial consistency and proportionality in the arrangement of the scene.",
