    "Question": "Q1: Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B only shows cartoon elements such as a paddle illustration with a red face and a cartoon character with a blue cap. These represent ping pong paddles and a human face. By using world knowledge, ping pong paddles generally have a clear shape and their accessories, if any, should logically fit without distorting the original structure. However, this image appears to be entirely cartoon-based, thereby lacking realistic stretching or warping.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrations show cartoonish features. Cartoon features are often represented with clean lines and smooth integration to maintain a consistent style as seen here. The elements do not represent actual stitching, sharp edges or shading issues in their design; they align with cartoon styling conventions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon chest depicted has golden edges which are confined to the border and the lid. These edges are illustrated to stay on the outermost part without improperly extending into other areas, maintaining logical consistency with the design of a cartoon treasure chest.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
    "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B have tails that are directed towards the characters they are associated with, ensuring clear communication. They are designed not to overlap with unrelated objects such as the box or paddle handles, adhering to common practices in graphic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
    "explanation": "The treasure map on Image B is a cartoon representation with lines typically smooth and consistent given the style. This illustration technique usually ensures that lines maintain uniformity, minimizing any pixelation or aliasing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict a real set of paddles positioned within a box; it is more of an abstract representation with a paddle illustration standing independently in a cartoonish setting. Realistic structural support as seen in Image A is not applicable here.",
    "answer": "No"
