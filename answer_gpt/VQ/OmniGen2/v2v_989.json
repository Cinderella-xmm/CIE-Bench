      "question": "Does the chibi-style illustration of the dog retain its distinct characteristics without unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated in a simplified and cartoonish chibi style, which is characterized by its exaggerated features, such as a larger head and smaller limbs. The dog's distinct visual characteristics, like its large eyes and soft features, are well maintained. The illustration is smooth, without any unnatural textures or glaring loss of fine details. Given the stylistic approach of chibi illustrations, the choice of smooth lines and simple shading adequately represents the subject matter without distorting it.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bold white outline around the illustration enhance visual clarity without disrupting structural coherence or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a bold white outline around the illustration which provides distinct separation from any potential background it might be placed upon. This outline enhances visual clarity by ensuring that the various elements of the sticker, such as the dog and park bench, are clearly defined and visually appealing. The structural coherence of the illustration is maintained, as the outline complements the design rather than disrupting it. There are no artifacts introduced that compromise the visual integrity or coherence of the elements within the sticker.",

      "question": "Do the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain structural consistency and visual credibility in their minimalist flat design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minimalist flat design of Image B exhibits a simplified representation of objects like the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag. This style focuses on clean lines and simplified forms that convey the essential features of each object. By analyzing this approach, it is clear that these objects maintain structural consistency: the bench is recognizable with its back and seat, the radio has distinct speaker features, the juice box retains its necessary detailing like brand labeling, and the trash bag is identifiable by its shape and tied top. Despite simplification, these elements are visually credible and fulfill their representation roles appropriately.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the extension of the dog and bench slightly beyond the circular frame preserve natural appearance and avoid distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design choice in Image B to have the dog and the bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame is likely driven by aesthetic and practical considerations, enhancing the dynamism and visual appeal of the sticker. The extensions are minimal and designed in such a way that they do not disrupt the sense of the natural dimensions or introduce distortion. This approach allows the key elements to be more prominent without compromising their authenticity or natural presentation.",

      "question": "Does the transparent background maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A transparent background in Image B is aimed at ensuring flexibility in overlaying the sticker on diverse surfaces without altering the illustrated content's integrity. This design choice enables the sticker to adapt to various environments while maintaining its intended appearance. Transparent backgrounds are a staple for making stickers seamlessly blend into their placement area, preserving the visual authenticity of the illustration.",
