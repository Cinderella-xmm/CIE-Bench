    "Question": "Q1: Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the porcelain model of the church maintains the architectural features such as symmetry and shape. The columns and arches appear correctly aligned, and there are no visible distortions or misalignments. This analysis is based on the visual cues that show a well-constructed miniature version of the real structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B features miniature human figures around the porcelain church. These figures appear to have simplified features due to their scale, but there is no indication of anatomical errors such as more than five fingers or unnatural postures. The poses appear reasonably realistic for the context of a miniature scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?",
    "explanation": "The trees in Image B are part of the porcelain model and are depicted in a simplified form resembling typical model trees rather than glass with refractive qualities. They do maintain natural-like structures for a miniature set, with no jagged outlines or unnatural colors.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes café tables without umbrellas. The tables have a simplified, accurately scaled appearance for a model set, with circular tops and straight, evenly spaced legs. However, the absence of umbrellas makes it impossible to evaluate their shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the antique marble base display consistent veining patterns and appropriate thickness, and is it positioned directly beneath the scene without floating or clipping errors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the marble base of the miniature scene displays consistent veining that is typical in marble. It appears to have appropriate thickness relative to the model and is correctly positioned under the scene without floating or clipping.",
    "answer": "Yes"
