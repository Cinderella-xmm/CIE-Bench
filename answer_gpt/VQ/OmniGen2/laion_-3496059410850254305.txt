    "Question": "Q2: Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wood grain pattern of the guitar is maintained without any appearance of a metallic finish. The grain appears consistent with natural wood textures, indicating that there hasn't been a dramatic alteration to replicate a metallic surface. This suggests the focus on maintaining the wooden appearance in the design, likely aiming for authenticity rather than artificial enhancement.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar elements such as strings and soundhole demonstrate continuity and proper alignment. However, illustrative lines, such as decorative or radiant elements joining the guitar and the armored figure, may not seamlessly align with structural components like the fretboard or headstock, indicating potential overlap or artistic inconsistencies inherent in creative renderings combining guitar and character.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the bodyâ€™s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar strings appear in their typical configuration, running across the body and fretboard continuously and tautly without interruptions or segments. Despite the incorporation of creative elements, the strings maintain their standard appearance and alignment with the body, emphasizing attention to realism for fundamental guitar features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
    "explanation": "The cape in Image B extends smoothly from the armored figure, demonstrating natural folds and flowing patterns characteristic of textile illusions. While it doesn't feature sound wave patterns, its visual continuity suggests adherence to realistic depictions of capes within illustrations, aiming for natural motion without structural disruptions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the emblem on the headstock fully visible, correctly aligned, and not overlapping with the tuning pegs or brand name?",
    "explanation": "The emblem on the headstock in Image B appears aligned with the headstock design, not overlapping tuning pegs or the brand name. This suggests precision in design and placement, emphasizing visibility and correctness in portraying brand elements even when altering visual contexts creatively.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of additional creative elements with the original guitar does not show discernible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or discontinuities. This reflects well-executed digital design ensuring seamless blending between parts, crucial for maintaining a visually coherent image.",
    "answer": "No"
