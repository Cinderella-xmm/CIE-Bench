    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual examination of the edited image reveals that the brass and copper textures of the headdress appear smooth and reflective, giving off a polished and coherent appearance without evident noise or patchy areas. This suggests careful attention to the metallic finish and uniformity of the segments, reflecting a high-quality edit.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stripes on the nemes headdress in the edited image are observed to be consistently aligned, maintaining their standard spacing without noticeable bending or misalignment. Despite the introduction of mechanical components, the stripes remain true to their original design, showcasing careful integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not display wings which are symmetrically placed or defined as described. These characteristics are assumed to be non-existent based on the components visible in the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clockwork designs on the collar in the edited image are detailed and meticulously crafted, with exhaust pipes positioned at logical locations and angles. There is no apparent overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements, indicating precise editing to maintain visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image does not show any vapor or steam emerging from exhaust pipes. Given the absence of such vapor effects, there are no concerns regarding sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in the edited image cannot be assessed in detail due to being blurred, thus preventing evaluation of alignment and anatomical correctness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
