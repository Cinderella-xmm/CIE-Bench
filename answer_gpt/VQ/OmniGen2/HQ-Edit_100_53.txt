    "Question": "Q1: Does the kimono feature bold, clean outlines and uniformly flat color regions without gradient blending or photographic texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is designed with bold outlines and flat color fills, which are characteristic of traditional Japanese art styles such as ukiyo-e. These styles typically have uniform color regions without gradient blending, aligning with woodblock printing techniques where separate blocks are used for different colors, resulting in a flat appearance. This contrasts with Image A, where the kimono has intricate patterns and texture, indicative of a photographic or highly detailed artistic style.",
