      "question": "Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, we can see that the guitar's headstock does not feature golden horn-like spikes; instead, it has the typical tuning pegs and design elements associated with a Gibson headstock. Therefore, based on the lack of such elements, there cannot be any clipping, distortion, or alignment issues related to spikes. This lacks alignment issues or mismatched angles since these golden horn-like spikes are not present.",

      "question": "Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fretboard features unique markers that look like luminescent runes. These runes are integrated with the fretboard, appearing clean and well-defined on the wood without bleeding into the surrounding material or seeming detached. Thus, they are visible and give the impression of being part of the fretboard rather than floating overlays.",

      "question": "Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible fiery tendrils present running from the bridge to the nut. As such, the description provided in the question does not apply to the image. Without such elements depicted in the image, we cannot say whether there are gaps or floating segments, nor can we assess their continuity or termination.",

      "question": "Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wings attached to the guitar, which are symmetrical regarding their size, position, and angle relative to the guitar body. The wings are adorned with realistic scale patterns that are evenly distributed, and no gaps or distortions are apparent. They extend outward in an equal manner on both sides of the guitar body, maintaining symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original silhouette of the guitar in Image A is preserved in Image B. The modified version features dragon-like textures and details, like well-defined wings, but these elements do not disrupt the contiguous outline of the guitar body. The textures add a fantasy-like appearance without introducing visible seams or altering the overall contour detail of the guitar's shape.",
