    "Question": "Q1: Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent upper material appears smooth and uniform, indicating advanced design techniques. Commonly, in high-quality digital designs, pixelation, jagged edges, or irregular opacity are minimized, suggesting that the transparency here is consistently maintained. Such clear, consistent surfaces are typical for professional renderings, reflecting expertise in digital imaging.",
    "answer": "Yes"
