    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystal orb surrounding the castle have clean, unbroken edges without visible distortion or bending of the castle’s structure inside it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orb encases the castle with a smooth, spherical surface, indicating a clean, unbroken edge. The structure inside the orb appears intact without distortion or bending, suggesting precise rendering. Based on the visual cues, the orb effectively maintains its boundary while preserving the castle's form inside.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clouds positioned above the castle without overlapping or clipping through any architectural elements, and do they have soft, natural-looking edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are situated around the top of the castle, remaining separate from any architectural elements and maintaining a soft, fluffy appearance that mimics the natural texture of clouds. They do not show any clipping or unnatural intersections with the castle structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vines climb the castle walls from the bottom upward, following the wall contours without breaking the stone texture or appearing to float in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts vines climbing along the castle structure, seemingly adhering closely to the castle walls without disturbing the stone texture or creating the illusion of floating. The vines follow an upward trajectory consistent with natural growth patterns, adhering to the contours of the walls.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gem-like flowers placed within the garden beds at a natural scale, with no excessive glare or repeating textures that indicate artificial rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers within the garden beds are proportionally scaled, adding vibrant colors without overwhelming glare or noticeable repeating patterns. The visual cues suggest a careful placement that integrates naturally with the garden despite their gem-like appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the dragon positioned on a stable part of the central tower, proportionally small compared to the structure, and casting a shadow aligned with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon in Image B is positioned atop a stable section of the central tower, proportionately smaller than the large structure of the castle. The shadow cast by the dragon aligns with the lighting source, showing thoughtful placement considering light direction and architectural stability.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the gold base lie flush with the ground, extend evenly under the castle, and show consistent engraved patterns without jagged edges or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold base in Image B appears to sit flush with the ground, supporting the castle evenly. Its engraved patterns are consistent and refined without jagged edges, suggesting a high-quality integration without errors in texture or alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all added elements (orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, base) structurally coherent with the original castle, showing no broken lines, floating components, or conflicting lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a unified scene where all elements — the orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, and base — are coherently integrated with the castle. There are no visible broken lines or floating components, and the lighting across these elements appears consistent without conflicts, suggesting careful editing and design.",
