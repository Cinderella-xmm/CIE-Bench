    "Question": "Q1: Does the red dress maintain natural fabric folds and surface texture despite increased saturation and bold outlines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress appears to be presented in a stylized manner, more akin to an illustrated or comic strip style. The increased saturation and bold outlining prioritize a graphic, distinct visual appeal over photographic realism. Often in comic art, clothing items may not display detailed textures or realistic fabric folds as they are simplified for style. Therefore, while the dress in Image B has a visual vibrancy and clear lines, it does not have the natural fabric folds and texture seen in realistic imagery.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the woman’s leg and arm positions consistent with natural human biomechanics during a walking motion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's pose is stylized but it mirrors a natural walking motion, where typically one leg is extended forward, and the arms have a slight swing matching the motion. This aligns with how a human body moves during walking, even in a stylized illustration. While the image uses artistic exaggeration, the biomechanics remain believable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the black slipcase visually integrated into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene takes a graphic and cartoon-like approach. The lighting and shadows do not follow realistic patterns but maintain a consistent style across the scene, which is typical for comic-like illustrations. The black slipcase appears integrated within this context as the entire scene's lighting and shadow are similarly stylized and consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold outlines around the woman’s body follow the natural contours of her shape without creating gaps or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines are a characteristic of comic art style and are designed to enhance the clarity of shapes. These outlines trace the woman's silhouette and features in a continuous, flowing manner, successfully conveying her form without gaps or misalignments. This aligns with how outlines are typically used in graphic illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the woman’s right hand have five fingers with natural proportions and smooth skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, which is more graphic and stylized, the right hand of the woman is drawn with stylized attention typical to comic art, showing exaggeration in proportions for artistic effect. The hand maintains five fingers in a somewhat normalized proportion based on this style, without deformation or additional digits, adhering to the comic's artistic conventions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
