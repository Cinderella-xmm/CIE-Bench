      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain a natural texture similar to the original kangaroo's fur, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure box features a cartoon-like rendition of a kangaroo character. The texture on the box is designed to match typical Funko Pop styles, which emphasize simplicity and vibrant colors rather than the natural fur texture of a real kangaroo. The design is not intended to mimic real fur but rather to present a stylized version, hence not maintaining a natural texture. Therefore, comparing it to the original kangaroo's fur in Image A would show no similarity in texture. World knowledge about Funko Pop designs clarifies that natural textures are not part of their aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box retain the correct proportions and structural consistency, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure inside the Funko Pop box is deliberately designed with exaggerated features common in chibi and Funko Pop styles. These include a larger head and smaller body. These specifications maintain the structural proportions consistent with the stylized art form, rather than realistic animal anatomy. This design choice is intentional for Funko Pop figures, which do have distortion compared to realism but remain consistent within its artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the highly realistic kangaroo figure outside the packaging display detailed textures and lighting consistent with the original image, enhancing its visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no highly realistic kangaroo figure shown outside the packaging in Image B. Instead, the image shows a chibi-style figure beside its box packaging, which is not intended to be realistic. Real-world knowledge of product and toy design suggests the highly stylized aesthetic present does not aim for realism, thus the question of detailed textures and lighting enhancing visual plausibility does not apply.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grassy base and hopping-related elements integrated naturally into the chibi-style kangaroo figure, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy base on which the chibi-style kangaroo figure stands is cleanly conceptualized, matching the fun, stylized aesthetic of the toy. The texture of the grass base is smooth per the figure's toy-like design and does not mimic realistic grass textures, but rather maintains a consistent aesthetic without appearing overly artificial or losing detail. Thus, the integration appears deliberate and fitting for the style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the Funko Pop figure box and the realistic kangaroo figure beside it appear visually credible and structurally coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B includes a chibi-style kangaroo figure and its corresponding packaging, both designed with playful art styles, not aiming for realism as in Image A. The elements are visually coherent as they fit within the context of merchandise promotion, with the box and toy sharing the same art style principles. However, the term 'realistic kangaroo figure' is misleading here, as the figure is stylized rather than realistic. The scene is coherent for its purpose, yet the figures are not akin to real-life counterparts.",
