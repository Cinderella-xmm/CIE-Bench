      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancers display physically plausible postures with their limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships. The angles in their limbs adhere to traditional ballet forms, with no exaggerated bends that would appear unrealistic in a dance context.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker outlines are sharp and seem well integrated onto the journal's surface. The shadows and lighting are matched with the surrounding environment, enhancing the realism of the stickers being part of the journal.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancers' hands show five fingers each, and they appear to have natural spacing and proportions. There are no indications of fused or additional digits, maintaining anatomical correctness.",
