      "question": "Does the front view of the apple maintain its original texture and color without any noticeable artifacts or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the apple appears polished with a smooth surface and uniform color, but upon close scrutiny, there is a lack of natural texture, such as the subtle irregularities and variations seen in real fruit. This can indicate some artificial processing towards achieving a glossy finish. The uniformity in color and lack of texture deviates from the realistic appearance of an actual apple.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cross-section in Image B looks very smooth with a lack of fine details like the slight fibrous texture commonly present in a real apple. This uniform smoothness lends an artificial appearance, making it seem more like an illustration than a real fruit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the top view of the appleâ€™s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top view of the apple's stem and calyx maintains a symmetrical and idealized form that looks more stylized than natural. The proportions and shapes lack the little imperfections and irregularities that are usually seen in organic objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple's shapes and sizes are consistent across views. However, the textures across the different views appear similarly unnaturally smooth and lack real-life richness, creating an artificial visual continuity rather than a natural one. The structural coherence is only maintained in a stylized sense.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows in Image B are consistent across the different views of the apple. However, they contribute to an artificial look rather than enhancing natural realism of the fruit, giving a unified yet stylized appearance that does not accurately mimic realistic conditions.",
