    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is presented with clear surfaces, and through its visual elements, there's no indication of distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections. The glass appears intact and well-rendered, showing an understanding of how glass should appear in such a presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows leather accents and brass corners with detailed textures and realistic lighting response. The materials are depicted as tightly attached to the case with no visible seams or floating effects, suggesting high-quality rendering in those regions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved emblem is visible with distinct depth and shadowing. However, it seems to be designed to appear on the case itself rather than blending into the glass. The emblem is well-integrated into the leather part below the glass, indicating it does not actually touch or blend into the glass itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds within the case are shown as separate and distinct from the aircraft with soft, volumetric textures. They do not exhibit clipping issues or unnatural transparency, maintaining the coherence and realism expected in such a display.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict the propellers with motion blur; they are static. The aircraft inside the case is presented as a model rather than a functional flying machine, reflecting an ornamental design. Given this context, the propellers are unlikely to demonstrate motion blur, which may not align with conventional expectations for operation-related alignment or motion-related effects.",
