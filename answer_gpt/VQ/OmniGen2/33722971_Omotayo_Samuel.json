    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the suitcases have faces that conform to the object’s spherical nature, like a spherical shape that can accommodate features without distorting. They are placed on top of rounded suitcases in a way that the features appear natural and proportional to their surfaces, indicating that no geometry distortion has occurred.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure have five fingers per hand, with natural hand shape and joint alignment, and no anatomical deformities or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure, a central character dressed in a suit with hands visible, appears to have five fingers on each hand. The hands are positioned correctly with joints aligned properly. There are no signs of anatomical deformities or missing limbs, confirming natural hand shape and structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture applied smoothly across all surfaces without visible seams, repetition, or unnatural lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet texture seems to be applied to parts of the attire and display case. The surfaces have consistent texture with even lighting, no noticeable seams or repeated patterns, and maintain a natural reflection, indicative of smooth velvet application.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the world map backdrop properly aligned with the scene’s perspective and does it integrate seamlessly without warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The world map in Image B is part of the backdrop and integrates well with the scene’s perspective. It fits naturally within the display case, with the top and sides of the case clearly delineating the map. There are no signs of warping or clipping which would otherwise cause perspective issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the display case fully enclosing the scene with correct proportions, no clipping of elements, and realistic glass transparency or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case encloses the scene proportionately, accommodating all elements without clipping. The case allows for adequate transparency, capturing reflections realistically across the glass surface, which enhances the enclosed setting without distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all fine details (e.g., stitching, hair, texture edges) preserved and free from blurring, ghosting, or pixelation after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains fine details such as the stitching on suitcases and clothing, hair, and texture edges. These details are sharp and coherent, showing no signs of common digital artifacts like blurring, ghosting, or pixelation, suggesting a well-preserved image post-editing.",
