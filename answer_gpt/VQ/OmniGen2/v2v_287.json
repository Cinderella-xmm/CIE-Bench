    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the 3D voxel model of the train maintain its original shape and proportions, avoiding any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train appears well-structured with clean lines and consistent proportions. The overall shape of the train, including curves and straight lines, is maintained intact, reflecting real-world train designs. There is no presence of distortion or broken geometric shapes, suggesting adherence to the original proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the train's surface, such as windows and lights, clear and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details on the train like the windows and lights appear distinct and sharp. The textures seem smooth, and the surfaces of these elements are free from pixelation or blurriness, indicating a clarity in their depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and colors of the 3D voxel model train match the style of the icons, ensuring a natural and consistent appearance with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B is rendered with colors and materials that closely match real-life trains, using subtle whites with red stripes similar to those commonly seen. The consistency with the rest of the station environment reflects a natural and harmonious integration with the scene's color palette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the 3D voxel model train and the real-world elements seamless, without introducing any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B seamlessly merges with the real-world background, maintaining a consistent visual theme. There are no visible artifacts or apparent inconsistencies where the train model meets the station environment, indicating a smooth integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement and orientation of the 3D voxel model train within the station platform appear natural and consistent with the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is placed on the tracks with an alignment and orientation that follow the expected direction within a station. The perspective and angle are consistent with the background and other elements, lending to a natural and coherent portrayal on the platform.",
