    "Question": "Q1: Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vases appear to have a plain matte finish rather than a marbled ceramic pattern. There are no visual cues indicating any texture breaks or artificial repetitions. The smoothness of the finish is evident, suggesting consistent and smooth patterns. However, without a marbled design present, the question seems to misrepresent the actual visual detail. Therefore, considering the smooth and consistent look without the complexity of marbling, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any branding decals applied directly on the vases. Instead, the branding appears on the packaging box. If the question refers to decals on the vases themselves, no branding is visible, therefore, the answer would be 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The vases in Image B do not display any gold leaf accents. The question seems to mistake any metallic features on the vases; instead, the vases have a consistent matte finish. Without gold leaf accents, the answer is 'No'.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging boxes feature graphics that illustrate the vases, including their petal arrangements. The depicted vase on the box accurately reflects a similar internal petal arrangement as seen on the actual vases. The geometric layout and layering appear correct and consistent with the shape of the vases. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?",
    "explanation": "The typography on the packaging box in Image B appears legible and clear. The bronze letters stand out against the dark background, with even spacing among the characters. The absence of blurring or unwanted shadows ensures good readability and an aesthetically pleasing design. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image A, the vases maintain a specific structure and symmetry. In Image B, although the vases are represented through packaging illustrations rather than physical objects, the visual representation still conveys a similar symmetrical and proportionally accurate look relevant to the original design. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'.",
    "answer": "Yes"
