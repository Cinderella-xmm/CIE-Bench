    "Question": "Q1: Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the peaks maintain their overall structure and angularity similar to Image A. There are no obvious signs of distortion such as stretching or bending affecting their alignment with the mountain base, indicating they remain intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows textures on the mountain slopes that appear rough and possess certain digital artifacts, like sharp edges or pixelation, disrupting the natural appearance seen in Image A. Such artifacts suggest repeated patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
    "explanation": "Though the mossy patches in Image B extend generally from existing vegetation zones, they do not appear entirely natural due to unnatural clustering and a lack of connection to the downhill gradient as seen in Image A, providing indications of digital manipulation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the valley area does not exhibit exaggerated protrusions that disrupt the natural flow from the depression to adjacent slopes, consistent with the smooth transition observed in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a maintained tonal range and an avoidance of sudden shifts in hue or brightness for the transformed mountain colors, harmonizing with the original landscape in Image A and maintaining visual coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
    "explanation": "Small-scale details in Image B, such as erosion lines and grass tufts, suffer from blurring and mild duplication, leading to a less distinct alignment with the terrain compared to Image A, indicating some loss of clarity due to editing.",
    "answer": "No"
