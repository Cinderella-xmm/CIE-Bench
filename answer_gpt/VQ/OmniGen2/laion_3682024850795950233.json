      "question": "Does the bread slice retain a natural crumb texture and crust edge without visible smoothing or unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bread slice used in the central design retains the appearance of a sandwich slice with a visible crumb texture and a natural crust edge. There is no notable smoothing or unnatural distortion observed. Common sense suggests that bread has a specific crumb texture, which is evident and consistent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features positioned within the bread slice and aligned with its surface plane, without appearing detached or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slice does not contain any facial features. It's used as a backdrop for the text 'America's Better Sandwichâ„¢'. The lack of facial illustrations on the bread indicates that the question might be misaligned with the image content.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lettuce leaves forming the cape show consistent leaf texture and natural curling, without flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a design element that resembles lettuce behind the bread slice. This element retains a consistent leaf texture with visible natural curling and green coloration. Upon visual inspection, the leaf maintains its detail without any flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting loss of detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hand-drawn illustrations in the timeline clearly defined with uniform stroke thickness and no visible pixelation or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The timeline in Image B showcases hand-drawn illustrations. They appear to have consistent stroke thickness, contributing to a well-defined look. There is no visible pixelation or broken lines in these illustrations, ensuring clarity and uniformity in design, consistent with common expectations for digital art.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all circular icons perfectly round with smooth edges and consistent fill color, without any jaggedness or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes several circular icons. Visual examination reveals that these icons maintain a perfect round shape with smooth, even edges. The fill colors are consistent, without any jaggedness or irregularities. This aligns with standard graphic design practices for precise geometric shapes.",
