      "question": "Does the roof of the van in Panel 1 tilt upward at a plausible angle without distorting the side panels or creating visible seams or breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the van's roof appears to have been illustrated with a clear and consistent structure. The angle of the roof does not seem to create any distortion in the side panels of the van, nor are there any visible seams or breaks in the structure of the van that would suggest an unnatural tilt. The visual cues indicate that the roof angle is plausible and consistent with common vehicle designs, where roofs generally have a smooth transition without abrupt changes that would affect the integrity of the side panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cactus in Panel 2 transformed into a spout with continuous curves and matching texture, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 of Image B shows a cactus that appears unchanged from a typical desert cactus; there is no indication that it has transformed into a spout. The texture resembles that of a natural cactus and aligns with standard artistic representations of such plants. The shadow cast by the cactus also appears consistent with the lighting direction portrayed in the panel, adhering to the typical light direction seen elsewhere in the scene, without introducing elements like a spout.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added plants around the oasis in Panel 3 rendered with the same level of detail and color harmony as the original cacti, and do they cast shadows that align with the scene’s lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3, there is no introduction of an oasis or new plants; the scene maintains a consistent visual representation of desert terrain and existing flora within the scene. The plants already present, such as the cacti, do maintain consistent detailing and color harmony. Thus, there is no inconsistency in shadow casting or detailing with added elements around an oasis since no new elements are introduced.",

      "question": "Are the text bubbles in all three panels positioned so they do not overlap critical parts of the van or landscape, and do they use a font style and size that matches the handwritten \"Road Trip\" title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubbles in all three panels of Image B are carefully positioned to avoid overlapping critical parts of the scene, such as the van or integral parts of the landscape. Their placement ensures they do not obscure important elements and are well-integrated into the composition. However, the font style and size used in the text bubbles differ from the handwritten style of the \"Road Trip\" title seen in Image A. The text style is more comic and bold, not matching the delicate, cursive style of Image A's title.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the water splashes in Panel 3 show droplets with varied sizes and arcing paths, and do they appear to originate from the van’s side without floating unnaturally above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, there are no water splashes depicted; therefore, there are no droplets or paths to analyze. The question of their origin or appearance relative to the van and the ground does not apply, as the scene remains consistent with the depiction of a dry desert environment without the introduction of water elements.",

      "question": "Are the headlights in Panel 2 enlarged and brightened but still contained within the original housing, and do they retain their round shape without stretching or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Panel 2 of Image B, the headlights do not appear to have been altered or exaggerated from their original depiction. They remain within the confines of the van’s design without showing signs of enlargement or brightness beyond typical headlights. Nor is there any evidence of distortion like stretching or clipping. The headlights maintain their functional, rounded shape as expected from a classic van design.",
