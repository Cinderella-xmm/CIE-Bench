      "question": "Does the outdoor camping scene seamlessly integrate with the toasters, maintaining consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on the toasters and the toast appear to be consistent with the outdoor setting. The sunlight casts realistic highlights and shadows on the metallic surfaces of the toasters, which aligns with the direction and intensity of the sunlight in the background. Shadows are cast in a direction that corresponds to the implied light source, suggesting successful integration of the objects in the scene.",

      "question": "Are the toasters placed naturally on the folding table without any visible distortion in the table's texture or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters appear to be placed cleanly on the folding table, and there is no visible distortion of the table's texture or structure at the points where the toasters and table interact. The perspective and alignment between the table surface and the toasters are plausible, maintaining a natural appearance without warping.",

      "question": "Do the sunlight effects on the toast create realistic highlights and shadows on both the toast and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight creates realistic highlights on the toasted bread, with shadows that naturally follow the contours and textures of the toast. The lighting is consistent across the toasters and the surrounding environment, with natural-looking reflections and light gradients that correspond with typical sunlight effects.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements smooth, without any noticeable artifacts or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements, including the table and toasters, is smooth without any noticeable artifacts. The elements within the image maintain cohesive visual qualities, and there are no abrupt or noticeable inconsistencies where the foreground meets the background, indicating a successful integration.",

      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the toasters remained intact and physically plausible in the new outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the toasters remain intact and are physically plausible. Their dimensions have not been altered in a way that would disrupt their realistic appearance, and they fit well on the table in terms of scale and perspective, maintaining consistent dimensions.",
