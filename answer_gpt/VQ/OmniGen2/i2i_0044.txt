    "Question": "Q1: Do the lettuce shapes appear as intended smears without breaking their natural connection to the sandwich and without introducing any unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lettuce visually appears as a cartoon-style representation with simplified outlines and exaggerated form, typical of a thick-painted style. This interpretation is expected in stylized artwork, where elements may not represent realistic texture but are coherent within the art style. Since the lettuce in Image B follows this style without introducing disruptive or unnatural patterns, the visual cues suggest it's intentional and matches the overall design scheme.",
