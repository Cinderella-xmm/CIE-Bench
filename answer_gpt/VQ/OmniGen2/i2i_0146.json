      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the stripes on the zebra are smooth and well-defined. Zebras naturally have sharply contrasting black and white stripes that follow the contour of their body. In Image B, the stripes maintain this flow and alignment across the body, suggesting a consistent pattern similar to real-life zebras, without any disconnection or breakage. Therefore, based on world knowledge of zebra patterns and the visual cues, the stripes are consistent with natural zebra patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears appear to be standing upright, which is typical for real-life zebras as their ears tend to be alert and attentive. The ears in the edited image reflect this real-life characteristic by being positioned upright and symmetrical, without showing any unnatural bending or distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a zebra-like figure with limbs and body proportions that are somewhat stylized. While the proportions are cartoon-like, they do not show any gross or unnatural exaggerations compared to typical cartoon representations. World knowledge of silhouette and proportions for both realistic and stylized zebras helps affirm that the edited image maintains a coherent shape without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the zebra's coat texture is smooth and devoid of any visible pixelation or artifacts. This aligns with the typical smooth appearance one would expect in a cartoon or digital rendering of such an animal. World knowledge of digital graphics helps assess the quality of texture as consistent and smooth.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding area lacks natural grass, as normally seen in real-world environments. Instead, the background is a solid green, suggesting that the grass has been removed or altered to create a simplified or stylized background. Comparing to typical natural environments where zebras are found, the lack of grass constitutes alteration.",
