      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual cues suggest a clean, paper-cut style which is characterized by sharp, well-defined edges. The rooflines, gables, and timber framing appear to maintain this style, with angular and precise lines that fit the design aesthetic of paper art, lacking any rounded or blurred transitions. This observation aligns with the requirement for a paper-cut style, where sharpness and clarity are paramount.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges appear uniformly applied with consistent reflectivity and no pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold foil accents in Image B are depicted with a consistent, uniform application across the window frames and flower box edges. The reflectivity seems well-rendered, maintaining a similar brightness and sheen across different parts of the images, without visible pixelation or smudging. These characteristics indicate a professional and intentional application, crucial for achieving a coherent, high-quality paper art aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the crimson color of the entrance awning evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting direction, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the crimson color of the awning is evenly applied, preserving a consistent tone across its entire surface. The distribution of color aligns with the assumed lighting direction, lacking any abrupt changes or unnatural shadow patterns that would disrupt the visual uniformity. This evenness is essential for maintaining the stylistic integrity of a clean and cohesive visual presentation in paper-cut art.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric arch borders cleanly aligned with the edges of the image and do they not overlap or distort any part of the building's structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the geometric arch borders are thoughtfully aligned with the image's edges, which avoids any overlapping or distortion with the building's architecture. The clean alignment is integral to maintaining the orderly, precise nature of paper-craft or cut-out styles, where elements are carefully placed to enhance rather than disrupt the structure's design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edge of the image appear clean and continuous without visible clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that suggest improper trimming or rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges are presented as smooth and continuous, devoid of any clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels. This seamless execution of the edges indicates a high-quality rendering process, ensuring the visual output adheres to the refined and polished standards expected in artistic representations like paper-cut styles.",
