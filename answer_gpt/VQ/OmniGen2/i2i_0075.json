      "question": "Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture on the cat's side appears consistent with the front part, both showing a smooth and continuous texture without visible artifacts. The fur is portrayed with details that resemble a natural feline coat. By observing the gradients and fur flow, it looks plausible and retains a realistic appearance. Hence, the edited image maintains a coherent fur texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the front and side views are depicted side by side without distortion or overlapping artifacts. The proportional representation of the cat’s anatomy is maintained, with both perspectives sharing an appropriate scale. Observing the structural alignment and form of the cat, the transition from front view to side view does not show any signs of disproportionate elements or overlapping issues.",

      "question": "Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat’s eyes and ears in Image B exhibit realistic shapes and defined details. The sharpness and clarity of these features are maintained without blurring. Both elements remain intact and natural-looking, portraying a lifelike depiction of a cat’s facial features, which showcases the artist’s attention to maintaining these details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the front and side views is visually plotted as two separate entities rather than blending into one another. This separation avoids any potential for broken geometric shapes or awkward intersection, maintaining the integrity of each perspective independently. The composition allows for a clear distinction, preventing any awkward visual juncture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall posture and positioning of the cat in Image B appear plausible and natural. Each view is independently presented without visual indicators of unnatural bending or stretching. The portrayal retains the natural form and pose of a sitting cat, upholding typical feline anatomy without distortions, conforming to a realistic representation of a cat’s stance.",
