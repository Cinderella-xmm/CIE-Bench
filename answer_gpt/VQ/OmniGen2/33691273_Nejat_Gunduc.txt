    "Question": "Q1: Does the man’s head position and hand placement near his ear form a plausible and anatomically correct pose that conveys a contemplative state without distortion or unnatural joint angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's head position and hand placement near his ear depict a common posture observed when someone is in a contemplative or thinking state. His head is tilted slightly forward and his hand rests gently near his ear, which is a plausible and natural pose that doesn't show any distortion or unnatural angles considering human anatomy. This is a regular position people assume while pondering something deeply, and there are no visible anomalies in this representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the new background elements (urban structures, lighting, and text) visually consistent with the monochrome tone and do they blend naturally without abrupt edges or conflicting textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the black and white background elements like urban structures and text are consistently styled to match the monochrome theme. They are well integrated without visible abrupt edges or clashing textures. The transition from graphic elements like buildings and speech bubbles into the environment appears smooth, reflecting a unified artistic style appropriate for this medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the thought bubbles properly aligned with the man’s head, drawn with consistent line quality, and free from pixelation or overlapping distortions?",
    "explanation": "The thought bubbles in Image B are positioned appropriately above and near the man’s head, illustrating a standard comic-style portrayal of thoughts or speech. They are drawn with consistent line quality that is typical in monochrome comic illustrations, showing no sign of pixelation or distortion, which indicates careful attention to alignment and detailing in this graphic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the man’s figure cast a consistent shadow or interact with the billboard surface in a way that preserves spatial depth and avoids floating or disconnected appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's figure seems well integrated with the background elements, resembling an illustration with layered depth typical of graphic design. Although it's a stylized representation, the shading and positioning preserve the perception of spatial depth without the figure appearing to float or be disconnected from the background. This maintains the immersive look intended in the modified visual narrative.",
    "answer": "Yes"

There are no visible signs of over-smoothing or artifacting, preserving texture detail and contributing to the illustration's overall quality and distinct style.",
