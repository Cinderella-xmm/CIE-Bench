      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the refrigerator doors and handles appear proportionally correct and geometrically consistent with typical refrigerator designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions and geometry of the refrigerator doors and handles should align with the standard design of side-by-side refrigerators. Typically, the doors are of equal width, as are the handles, which should be straight and centrally located on each door. In Image B, the refrigerators appear to have equal-sized doors, and the handles are vertically aligned and centrally placed on each door, reflecting common design features. Thus, the proportions and geometry appear correct.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator free from unnatural textures, maintaining a consistent and authentic finish throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the metallic surfaces to maintain authenticity, they should exhibit a smooth, brushed finish without any visible inconsistencies or patterns that do not naturally occur on such surfaces. In Image B, the surfaces of all refrigerators appear smooth and uniform, without irregular textures or artificial patterns, suggesting an authentic metallic finish as expected.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting appear uniform across both refrigerators, without noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Uniform lighting would mean that there are no abrupt changes in brightness or unnatural highlights/shadows between the two refrigerators. The lighting should mimic natural conditions, possibly coming from ambient sources like the ceiling or side windows. In Image B, the lighting across all refrigerators seems even, with consistent brightness and no excessive shadows or highlights that break the natural flow, indicating proper lighting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there smooth transitions where the refrigerators meet the cabinets, without visible seams or edges that break the visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Smooth transitions imply that the refrigerators should be uniformly integrated into the surrounding kitchen cabinetry without visible gaps, seams, or misalignments. In Image B, the cabinets appear to seamlessly encompass the refrigerators, with no evident visual breaks or inconsistencies, indicating smooth integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly defined and positioned appropriately, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water dispensers should be placed at a practical height, usually at about one-third of the total fridge height, and should be well-defined with visible components like digital panels and spouts. In Image B, the dispensers on all refrigerators are clearly defined and positioned in a realistic manner, contributing to the design's authenticity.",
