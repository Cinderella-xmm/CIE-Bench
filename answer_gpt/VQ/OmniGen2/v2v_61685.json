      "question": "Do the simplified human figures and the background tent maintain their structural coherence without introducing unnatural geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures and the tent are represented in a simplified, cartoon-like style that emphasizes clean lines and basic geometric shapes. This abstraction intentionally avoids complex details, focusing on essential contours to maintain coherence. Comparing Image B with Image A, the figures and the tent follow a consistent and proportionate structure, reflecting the original scene's composition, albeit in a stylized manner. The artistic emphasis on simplification doesn't compromise structural coherence, as the abstraction purposefully portrays a simpler representation without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors restricted only to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt, and do they appear natural without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette has been deliberately simplified, focusing primarily on blue and white for the background and tent, and green for the man's shirt. These colors are uniformly applied, employing a flat and solid style typical in illustrations, to create a uniform and intentional reduction in complexity. Comparing this to Image A, where the colors are more varied and natural, Image B intentionally adopts a restricted palette to maintain harmony in the artistic style with solid colors. The application avoids textures, preserving the smooth, intentional flatness without appearing unnatural for the chosen style.",

      "question": "Does the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrate seamlessly into the upper cloudy sky region without disrupting the natural appearance of the clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' is positioned against a clean, blue background, instead of clouds. The placement above the human figures, with their surroundings utilizing a simplified color scheme, doesn't attempt to integrate with any natural clouds. Comparing to Image A, where clouds exist, the edited image replaces natural elements with graphic elements. The text in Image B is designed to fit within the transitions of shapes and colors, typical in graphic illustrations, thus avoiding any problem of integration with non-existent clouds.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the human figures and skateboards maintained realistically, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures and skateboards remain proportionally consistent with what would be expected in a realistic scenario, maintaining a believable scale relative to each other. This illustration style maintains the overall pose and size from Image A, despite the simplification, ensuring that the limbs, body sizes, and skateboard dimensions are relatable to real-world proportions. Given the artistic context, the intention is not ultra-realism but maintaining believable ratios which Image B successfully achieves without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the skateboards and clothing been preserved without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of skateboards and clothing is simplified and lacks detailed texturing, focusing on clean outlines and blocks of color typical in illustrations. This choice deliberately foregoes fine details, contrasting with Image A's realistic textures and patterns. This lack of detail is an intentional feature of the art style, where the emphasis is on recognizable form over detail, and so it does not introduce unnatural textures or unwanted discrepancies. The absence of fine details is a characteristic of the chosen representational style, aligning with the simplification theme rather than implying a loss.",
