      "question": "Are the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel evenly spaced, angularly consistent, and free from jagged edges or irregularities that suggest distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chevron pattern on the front panel appears to be symmetrical and consistent, showing no signs of uneven spacing or irregularities. This observation is derived from visual cues like evenly angled lines that maintain a continuous flow, typical of professionally manufactured patterns. The absence of visual distortions such as jagged edges suggests the pattern is rendered accurately.",

      "question": "Do the gold zippers retain their linear definition and proper placement along the seams, with no misalignment or broken segments suggesting artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold zippers appear straight and well-aligned with the seams of the bag, connecting smoothly without gaps or breaks. This appearance reflects the skilled designing and manufacturing of quality bags, where zippers are crucial for functionality and typically designed to align perfectly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the olive tone applied uniformly across the surface of the bag, with no patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation that suggests digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an olive tone that appears consistently applied across the bag's surface. There are no visible discrepancies like color patchiness or bleeding, which are common indicators of digital artifacting. This suggests that the color saturation and tone are deliberately and uniformly maintained, likely a result of professional photography or high-quality material in the bag's design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank message area on the back of the postcard aligned with the dimensions of the front design, with straight edges and no visible warping or layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard can be seen standing inside a black portfolio behind the bag, but its edges align straight and true. There’s no visible warping or errors that suggest misalignment between the front and back, which indicates a design made to fit seamlessly into the portfolio’s dimensions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the black portfolio contain the postcard with proper depth and alignment, showing no clipping, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the black portfolio appears to contain the postcard without unnatural gaps, shadow mismatches, or clipping issues. The postcard fits within the portfolio with precise alignment, suggesting careful placement and design, professional common in portfolios intended for stationary display or transport.",
