      "question": "Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy's head is illustrated using simple shapes and colors, typical of a stylized or cartoon-like rendition. The birds are depicted as smaller and stylized as well, aligning with the same artistic approach. This simplifies details but maintains visual coherence. Based on the artistic style, they appear proportionate without noticeable distortion, akin to how stylized images prioritize form over realistic proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the block colors used for the boy's skin tone and feather textures appear clean and uniform, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts block colors in a vector-style illustration. The boy's skin tone is uniform, as is typical for such stylizations, creating a clean look without gradients or artifacts. The feather textures follow the same pattern, with simplified and consistent coloring across surfaces. The style does not rely on realistic textures, making the use of block colors clean and uniform.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the white outlines around the boy and birds smooth and consistent, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the outlines reveals they are uniformly smooth and adequately consistent. This is typical of vector-style illustrations, where outlines are intentionally made smooth to enhance visual simplicity and clarity. There are no observable breaks or jagged edges, indicating a tidy edge work common in graphic designs.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are simplified in a vector-like artistic style, differing from the realism in Image A. They do not retain realistic fine textures but are instead depicted through clean lines and flat colors typical of graphical representation, which inherently avoids pixelation or loss of clarity. It aligns with the stylistic choice, keeping clear shapes intact without realistic detail loss.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition with the enlarged boy's head and shrunken birds appear balanced and neatly arranged, providing visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a playful and stylized arrangement which centers around the boy's head, incorporating shrunken birds in a manner where space distribution and relative positioning are visually harmonious. This arrangement provides a sense of balance typical of stylized designs. The head and birds, though disproportionately scaled, are arranged to create an orderly composition fitting within the artistic context.",
