    "Question": "Q1: Does the marble grotto structure exhibit uniform stone-like texture and natural veining throughout, without artificial-looking smoothness or irregular patches?",
    "explanation": "The edited image shows a structure with a marbled appearance, though it appears more stylized and plastic-like due to the smoothness and uniformity. Natural marble typically has unique and varying veining patterns that add texture and depth. In this image, the surface appears overly uniform and smooth, lacking the spontaneous veining that characterizes natural marble.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the porcelain figurines retain accurate anatomical proportions and facial features without deformation, and do they display a consistent glossy finish across all surfaces?",

Porcelain figures usually have refined details and a glossy finish. Here, the finishes appear consistent in glossiness, but the lack of facial features detracts from typical anatomical accuracy.",
