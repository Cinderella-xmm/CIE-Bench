      "question": "Does the themed box appear to have a natural industrial aesthetic without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a box with bearings, which should ideally display an industrial aesthetic with smooth, metallic finishes characteristic of machine components. However, the text on the box is distorted and not easily readable, suggesting an unnatural texture or artifact in the presentation. The fonts and arrangement in image B seem to visually interfere with the expectation of a clean industrial design. Therefore, the box does not appear fully natural due to these distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the themed box in isometric perspective consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a themed box with bearings arranged inside, expected to be in an isometric perspective to maintain uniformity and consistency. The angles and dimensions should ideally be aligned to provide visual clarity. Upon inspection, the box does not maintain consistent proportions or angles when compared with realistic isometric presentations; the text and container shapes seem slightly warped from expected isometric perspective standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bearings and components inside the box retain their fine details and appear precise without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bearings inside the box in Image B are expected to show detailed machining patterns and metallic finishes, characteristic of precision-engineered components. From observation, these components lack sharp focus and fine details; they appear slightly blurry or indistinct, leading to a perception of loss of detail compared to high-precision bearing imagery.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic texture and intricate design of the primary bearing outside the box rendered photorealistically without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the primary bearing outside the box in Image B, the expectation is a photorealistic presentation, showing the smooth metallic finishes typical of industrial-grade bearings. However, the surface texture and shading do not convincingly emulate a realistic metallic bearing; there's a lack of realistic depth and light reflection. The textures come off as digitally rendered rather than realistic, suggesting some artificiality in the bearing's portrayal.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bearings and components arranged in an organized manner both inside and outside the box, contributing to visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of bearings and components in Image B should be orderly, suggesting functionality and industrial design logic. The bearings are placed inside compartments, and others outside, aiming for visual harmony and practical arrangement. Despite the distortions in the text and overall presentation, the placement of components is physically organized in distinct sections, indicating intention towards ordering and credibility in arrangement.",
