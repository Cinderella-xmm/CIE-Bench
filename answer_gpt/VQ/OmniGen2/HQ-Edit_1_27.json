      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower’s structure preserved with accurate proportions and no geometric distortions despite being scaled down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is encapsulated within a glass dome, but has been scaled down significantly. The proportions of the scaling maintain the iconic shape and intricate lattice features of the Eiffel Tower without noticeable distortions, ensuring the representation is accurate even at reduced size. This assessment is based on the visual cues of the Eiffel Tower's familiar shape and structure seen in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, seamless glass dome structure above the scene that fully encloses it without intersecting or distorting any elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scene with a glass dome encapsulating the miniature Eiffel Tower landscape. The dome appears seamless in its construction, with smooth curves that don’t intersect or distort the enclosed scene or its components such as trees and human figures. The visual cues suggest a well-crafted, transparent dome without visible flaws.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snow cover on the ground, trees, and lampposts appear uniformly powdery and free of clumping or artificial texture patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B reveals the snow on the ground, trees, and lampposts is evenly spread and retains a natural, powdery texture. There are no clumps or synthetic texture patterns noticeable, indicative of a realistic portrayal of snow in winter scenes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all human figures proportionally small, anatomically correct (including hands with no more than five fingers), and posed in natural stances without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features human figures that are exceptionally small in scale to fit within the glass dome setting. Despite their miniature size, these figures are anatomically correct, showcasing typical arm and hand postures with no more than five fingers visible per hand, all posed naturally, and without any distortions or peculiarities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the streetlamps emit a faint, diffused glow without bright halos or overexposed areas, and are they aligned along the pathway as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Streetlamps in Image B are spaced evenly along a pathway in a miniature setting, similar to Image A but without excessive brightness or halos, maintaining a subtle diffusion of light. This configuration captures the essence of softly illuminated streets typically seen in idyllic winter scenes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are cobblestone textures visibly embedded beneath the snow along the pathways, showing consistent patterns and fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Close observation of Image B reveals pathways covered in snow with cobblestone textures subtly visible beneath. These pathways display uniformity in pattern and detail, contributing to an authentic representation of a wintry environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tree branches thin, naturally branched, and lightly dusted with snow without sagging or unnatural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted with thin, appropriately branched limbs. They are lightly covered with snow while maintaining their upright position, thus appearing realistic without any unnatural droop or excessive accumulation that would otherwise skew the natural look.",
