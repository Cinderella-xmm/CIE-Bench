      "question": "Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe encapsulates a miniature beach scene with a surfer figure, sun, and waves. Given the context of a snow globe, it's expected to creatively capture miniature worlds. The chibi style is an artistic choice that slightly caricatures features, which is common and accepted in art and collectibles. Despite being a conceptual adaptation, both the snowy ambiance in the globe and the external environment featuring a fireplace provide a clever and visually credible integration. Therefore, by using this artistic license, the structure is consistent with the intended whimsical effect.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style character in Image B has simplified features, which often includes a reduction in detail for hands.

The textures do not present any abnormalities, thus maintaining a natural appearance within its artistic design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the shapes of the surfer and the surfboard are integral components and appear well-defined within the constraints of the snow globe. The curves and lines of both the figure and the board maintain their structure effectively, suggesting no visual distortion or loss of geometric integrity. This contributes to the reliability of the artistic rendering.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe's placement on the wooden shelf is consistent with how such items are typically displayed in a living space. Its proximity to the fireplace, combined with the scale and alignment, enhances a cozy, realistic setup. The proportional relationship between the snow globe and the surrounding environment is believable, supporting an authentic and realistic visual impression.",
