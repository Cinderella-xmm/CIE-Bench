      "question": "Does the edited image retain authentic swirl patterns and color transitions in the night sky, maintaining its style and materials without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirl patterns in the night sky maintain a resemblance to the original swirling style known from Van Gogh's 'Starry Night.' However, the color transitions are changed significantly, introducing neon-like, almost iridescent greens and blues which deviate from the classic look. This alteration creates an unnatural texture in terms of the historical context of the painting style. Thus, while the overall artistic swirl pattern is present, the textures and colors differ greatly in evocative authenticity and material representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and alignment of key elements such as the cypress tree and the village preserved correctly in the bedroom scene, ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the key elements in Image B, the cypress tree retains its tall and prominent placement on the left side, and the village scene is aligned similarly beneath the swirling sky. The structural alignment of these elements provides a consistent positioning as seen in the original 'Starry Night,' despite the shift in color palette. Therefore, the structural proportions and key element alignments are preserved, ensuring visual credibility within the modified context.",

      "question": "Do the church steeple and stars maintain their crisp details and natural appearance in the wall sticker, avoiding unnatural distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church steeple appears simplified, losing some finer details as part of the transformation into a wall decoration. The stars, represented as bright circles, lack the detailed brushstroke texture in Image A and appear more elementary in form due to the change in color intensity. Consequently, the details are less crisp and naturally depicted, showing some level of distortion from the original.",

      "question": "Do the colors used for the glow-in-the-dark effect create a natural and visually plausible appearance, harmonizing well with the bedroom environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B use vibrant neon greens and blues, designed to simulate a glow-in-the-dark effect. These colors, although unnatural in the traditional painting context, achieve visual harmony with the bedroom's modern and minimalist decor due to their bright, appealing look, which stands out as planned by interior design choices meant for dramatic effect. Therefore, while not natural in a classical sense, they do achieve a certain harmony in the specific setting they are designed for.",

      "question": "Are the shapes and forms of elements like the clouds and moon preserved accurately in the edited image, avoiding any damage or unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Focusing on Image B, the basic swirling shapes of the clouds retain their iconic formality as known from Van Gogh's work, but the moon and clouds have severe color alteration with fluorescent hues causing distortion in their tonal depiction rather than their form. Their shapes seem accurate in silhouette but suffer from color and style alteration, making them appear less natural as a result.",
