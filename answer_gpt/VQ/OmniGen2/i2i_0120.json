      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the figurine on the white ceramic coffee table appropriate and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is placed on a white ceramic coffee table, and the size relative to the table’s surface is plausible for a small collectible. The placement is central, and there is ample space around it, which suggests intentional positioning for visual display. The relative size matches common collectibles and does not overwhelm the table, indicating awareness of physical constraints and visual balance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green plants in the background serve as natural decor elements, commonly found in domestic settings. The texture and lighting on the plants are consistent with natural foliage, showing no signs of artificial manipulation. The lighting and shadowing are coherent across the scene, integrating the plants naturally with other elements like the figurine and table.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tea utensils in Image B, including a teapot and cup, are positioned on the table and maintain appropriate proportions relative to the figurine. Their size suggests they are typical household items, not disproportionately large or small when compared to the figurine. The positioning close to the edge of the table and beside the figurine adds to the scene's decorative balance, suggesting careful arrangement for visual harmony.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is composed with elements that seamlessly integrate, including the figurine, plants, and tea utensils. There are no visible artifacts, blurring, or distortions across the image that could disrupt the viewer's sense of realism in the scene. The lighting and shadows are consistently applied, which enhances the cohesive and natural appearance of the entire composition.",
