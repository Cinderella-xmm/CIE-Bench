    "Question": "Q1: Do the biscuit panels on the building walls exhibit uniform texture and color without visible cracks, patches, or unnatural grain patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the biscuit panels comprising the building walls show a consistent texture and uniform color. The surface appears smooth, mimicking the aspects of a well-baked biscuit or gingerbread, with no signs of cracks, patches, or irregular grain patterns that might suggest damage or inconsistency. The panels are evenly colored and maintain a cohesive appearance, which is typical for crafted food items like biscuits intended to depict architectural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the sugar-glazed dome smoothly curved with consistent color and reflective properties, and does it align correctly with the base structure without appearing warped or misproportioned?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the sugar-glazed dome on the building has a smooth curvature and consistent coloring indicative of a meticulous glaze application. It reflects light uniformly, suggesting an even surface. The dome is proportionately aligned with the structure beneath it, contributing to a seamless transition from the walls to the dome. There are no signs of warping or disproportion that might affect the architectural integrity of the model.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the icing patterns on the windows and doors clearly defined, evenly applied, and positioned within the frame boundaries without overlapping or deforming the original window/door shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the icing patterns around the windows and doors appear carefully applied. The patterns are clearly defined and follow the intended contours of each frame. The positioning is precise, with no noticeable overlap or distortion of the window and door shapes. Such precision is critical in decorative confectionery and is well-executed here, making the details visually appealing and structurally accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the tree trunks and branches maintain natural branching patterns, and are the sugar-coated leaves evenly distributed without clumping or floating effects?",
    "explanation": "The trees in Image B, crafted from the same material as the building, simulate real trees with trunks and branches displaying a natural pattern. The sugar-coated leaves are evenly distributed across these branches. They adhere closely to where leaves would naturally place, avoiding clumping or floating, which would detract from the realistic representation of tree foliage in edible art.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the marble slab extend continuously under the building and surrounding area, with consistent lighting and reflection, and no visible gaps or distortions at the edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a marble slab serving as the base for the gingerbread-like structure, extending uniformly under the building and surrounding area. The lighting and reflection on this marble base appear consistent across its surface, with no visible gaps or edge distortions that might disrupt the continuity or aesthetic of the edible display setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
