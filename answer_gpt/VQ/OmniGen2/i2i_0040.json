      "question": "Are the textures on the bike frame and surrounding grass natural, without any visible artifacts or unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the visible elements are a digital interface with text and buttons, lacking any physical objects like bike frames or grass textures. This suggests the question might not be applicable as the image focuses on a digital welcome screen rather than photographing a natural scene like in Image A. Therefore, evaluating textures like a bike or grass doesn't apply here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels and frame of the bike maintain their correct proportions and geometry, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible bike or components such as wheels and frames. The image is of a digital screen with text and graphical elements that do not relate to physical bike geometry. Hence, there is no basis to assess proportions or distortion related to a bike in this context.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background clean and free from distracting elements, preserving the natural scene and focusing on the bike without introducing unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a digital interface with a 'WELCOME TRAK' message and graphical elements, not a natural scene with a bike. The background features a clear sky with some trees visible at the bottom, which appears clean but does not relate to a natural scene like the one with a bike in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the bike and the surrounding area look natural and consistent with the original environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a digital screen with no visible bike or shadows that could be assessed for natural lighting. The image uses a graphic interface and does not have physical elements to exhibit or evaluate lighting and shadow consistency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bike positioned naturally within the frame, maintaining visual coherence and plausibility without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a bike; it features a welcome screen of a digital design interface, including text and elements like buttons. Thus, the question of bike positioning does not pertain to the context of Image B.",
