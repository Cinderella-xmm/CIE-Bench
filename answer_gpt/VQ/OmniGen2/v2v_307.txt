    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style representation of the bandage inside the packaging maintain structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style depiction of the bandage inside the packaging is designed with attention to maintaining the key structural elements of a typical bandage. The simplistic, cartoonish style is coherent with the chibi design, presenting an intentionally exaggerated and cute aesthetic that avoids introducing any unnatural textures or distortions. Chibi art typically simplifies details, so the representation matches its art style without looking distorted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the fabric texture and adhesive surface of the realistic bandage outside the packaging depicted with high detail and free from artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The bandage shown outside the packaging in Image B exhibits high-quality texture representation. The fabric part of the bandage shows detailed texture, mimicking the look of a real adhesive bandage, while the adhesive surface appears smooth and adherent. This realistic depiction aligns with photographic quality and is free from digital artifacts, demonstrating attention to detail in the rendering process.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the packaging design, including the isometric perspective and the label 'HEALING ESSENTIALS,' integrate naturally into the scene without disrupting visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging for 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is rendered in realistic 3D perspective with an isometric view that fits naturally on the surface. The label is clear and appropriately scaled, making it legible without any distortions. The scene retains its visual credibility, as the packaging convincingly coexists with the bandage, suggesting a proficient execution of design and perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions and placement of the chibi-style bandage within the packaging logically consistent with the realistic bandage outside, avoiding any distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the chibi-style bandage depicted on the packaging are designed to fit within the context of chibi art, characterized by exaggerated but consistent dimensions. When compared to the realistic bandage outside, there is an evident style difference rather than a proportionate disparity or distortion. The depiction retains logical placement and style consistency with the character of the chibi aesthetic.",

    "Question": "Q5: Do the materials used for the packaging and the realistic bandage appear natural and consistent with their intended purpose, without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the packaging and the realistic bandage with appropriate material depiction. The plastic-like packaging and the tactile texture of the bandage both align with what would be expected in real life. The materials are presented without visible artifacts, and they convey the intended purpose and function with credibility and attention to detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
