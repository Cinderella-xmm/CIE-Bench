      "question": "Does the adult character’s face retain symmetrical and proportionate features with clearly defined eyes, mouth, and cheeks without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no adult character’s face visible, only two children reading books. Therefore, this question does not relate to the content of Image B, and there is no adult character to evaluate for symmetry and proportion.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clothing details of the top child, including the blue hat and jacket, smoothly rendered with no visible pixelation, color bleeding, or texture gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top child character is depicted with a blue hat and jacket. Visual analysis of these elements shows they are smoothly rendered with clear lines and solid colors. There are no visible pixelation, color bleeding, or texture gaps affecting the clothing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glow effect on the book limited to a soft halo without affecting the color or clarity of the surrounding hands or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a subtle glow effect emanating from the book held by the blurred face character. It creates a soft halo effect which does not interfere with the clarity or color of the character's hands or the surrounding background.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the background elements placed behind the characters and do they respect depth, avoiding any clipping through arms, legs, or heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual examination of Image B shows that the background elements, such as trees and flowers, are appropriately placed behind the characters. There is a clear sense of depth, and these elements do not clip through any character’s arms, legs, or heads.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden signposts are located on either side of the path, creating a plausible setting. They display visible wood grain texture and have text that appears handwritten, which is legible without distortion.",
