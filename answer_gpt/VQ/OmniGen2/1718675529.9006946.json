      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns along the shoreline consist of smooth, continuous geometric curves without jagged or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns are depicted using stylized geometric shapes that are smooth and continuous. There are no jagged edges or disconnected segments in the curves of the waves, which are typically seen in graphic imagery rather than realistic depictions. This stylization creates a uniform and consistent appearance. Image A features realistic waves with natural curves and variations. When comparing the two, Image B represents the waves with a clear intent of stylization which lacks any jagged features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the palm trees along the right side of the beach represented as clean, straight vertical lines without irregular gaps or misplaced branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree is drawn with clean and straight lines, typical of stylized illustrations. The trunk runs vertically with evenly distributed branches creating a classic cartoon-like form. Image A presents realistic palm trees with natural variations in branches and trunk forms. Comparatively, Image B's palm tree adheres to a simplistic representation without any misalignments or irregular gaps.",

      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without visible distortion or mismatched edges between adjacent cloud shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows clouds in the sky that are stylized and symmetrical, consistent with flat design aesthetics. They are arranged with smooth, curved edges and exhibit a repeating pattern that aligns cohesively within the illustration style. Image A features realistic cloud formations with natural variations that do not adhere to symmetry. Therefore, Image B intentionally displays a symmetrical and pattern-like arrangement without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire scene uniformly rendered in muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, with no areas exhibiting bright or out-of-place colors such as vivid cyan or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used for the scene are consistent and harmonized within a palette of muted greens, blues, and oranges, typical of stylized illustrations. There are no bright or out-of-place colors such as vivid cyan or yellow. This uniform use of color tones creates cohesiveness within the design. Image A, on the other hand, uses a wide range of colors reflecting natural scenery. Image Bâ€™s palette is purposefully confined to specific tones for a stylized effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the rocks on the sandy shore appear proportionally consistent with the surrounding terrain, and are they positioned in a way that aligns with the slope and texture of the beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is a stylized representation, featuring waves, a palm tree, and sun, without actual rocks on the beach. Thus, there aren't any rocks to assess proportionality or positional alignment. Comparing with Image A, the rocks are naturally positioned and proportionally consistent with the realistic beach setting. Since Image B does not depict rocks, it cannot be assessed for proportional consistency or alignment with the terrain.",
