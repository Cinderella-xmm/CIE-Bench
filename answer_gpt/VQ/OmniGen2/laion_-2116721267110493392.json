      "question": "Do the cartoon versions of the two boys have proportionally correct head shapes and facial features that align with typical human anatomy, without exaggerated or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon versions of the boys have distinctly larger heads compared to their body size, a common trait in cartoon drawing styles, especially in 'chibi' or caricature forms. This stylistic choice deliberately exaggerates certain features for a playful and whimsical effect, which does not align with typical human anatomy where head-to-body proportions are usually more balanced.",

      "question": "Are the cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements rendered with consistent material textures and lighting that match the surrounding environment, avoiding glossy or flat-painted artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements exhibit a consistent, smooth texture with even lighting, which complements the bright and cheerful aesthetic of the cartoon classroom setting.

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floating books and animated tablet screen positioned in a way that respects spatial depth and casting appropriate shadows, ensuring they appear physically plausible within the classroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floating books and animated tablet screens are positioned to appear as if they are part of a whimsical, magical classroom environment. However, the concept of 'floating' inherently suggests a suspension of typical physical laws like gravity and shadow casting. Thus, within the context of this playful, animated setting, spatial depth is less about realism and more about creative expression.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robots and gadgets are designed with smooth, polished surfaces and are scaled appropriately in relation to the children, enhancing the playful and interactive environment. There are no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or missing textures, suggesting a high-quality rendering in the cartoon depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'A CLASSROOM ADVENTURE' is prominently placed at the top of the image, ensuring it is noticeable and does not overlap any important graphical elements. The style features clean lines and consistent thickness, incorporating a playful font that aligns well with the cartoonish style of the illustration.",
