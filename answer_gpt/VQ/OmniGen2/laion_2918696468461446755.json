      "question": "Do the trench coats and fedoras on all characters have natural fabric draping and proper fit without visible distortion or clipping against limbs?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trench coats and fedoras in Image B are visually consistent with the style of detective costumes, typical of noir or mystery themes.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foggy cityscape background is well-integrated with the characters in the foreground.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
