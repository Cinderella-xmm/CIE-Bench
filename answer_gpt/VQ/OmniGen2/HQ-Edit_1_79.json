      "question": "Are the fingers in the central panel positioned naturally over the book page, with no unnatural bending, extra joints, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers on the central panel appear well-proportioned and naturally positioned over the book. The hands are depicted in a way that seems plausible, with no visible unnatural bending or distortion that would typically indicate poor rendering or editing errors. The fingers have normal joint positioning and do not show extra joints.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hand on the left panel transition into a tree branch with a smooth, continuous shape, maintaining five fingers and no abrupt geometric breaks or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand on the left panel transitions smoothly into a tree branch. The depiction shows a coherent transformation with a continuous shape, which suggests an artistic intention. The fingers are visually complete and there are no breaks in continuity or missing digits, which indicates a successful integration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral embellishments on the right side of the bench attached to the wooden surface without floating or misalignment, and do they have consistent lighting and shadow direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the right panel of Image B, the floral embellishments appear to be well-positioned on the bench. They do not appear to be floating or misaligned with the wooden surface. Furthermore, the lighting and shadows are consistent with the rest of the illustration, indicating careful design and integration into the panel.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the edges of the card panels display a natural leaf pattern with soft texture and color blending, without pixelation or unnatural line work?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the card panels in Image B present a soft, natural leaf pattern. The blending of colors is smooth, and there is no noticeable pixelation or harsh lines that would suggest poor image quality. This indicates a high-quality rendering that adheres to natural aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three panels aligned horizontally across the image, with consistent size and spacing, and do they sit within the frame without overlapping or distorting the original subject or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three panels are clearly aligned horizontally with equal spacing and consistent dimensions. They are positioned within the frame neatly and do not interfere with, or distort, any other elements within the image. This suggests that the design is deliberate and balanced.",
