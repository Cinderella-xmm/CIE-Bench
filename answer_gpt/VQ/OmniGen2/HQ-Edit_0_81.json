      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the elderly man’s robe evenly distributed, continuous across folds and seams, and free from jagged edges or texture repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the robe appear to be consistently distributed and align well across folds, which indicates a smooth and even appearance. This suggests a high-quality edit where the texture has been applied carefully to avoid jagged edges or noticeable repetition artifacts. The continuity across folds shows thoughtful editing to maintain the robe's visual integrity.",

      "question": "Does the ornate wooden staff maintain a natural wood appearance with coherent grain direction, proper thickness, and no floating or detached decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The staff in Image B has a consistent wood grain direction and appears to maintain a realistic thickness fitting for a walking staff. There are no visible detached or floating decorative elements that suggest an alteration from its natural appearance. The overall look suggests a coherent depiction of an ornate wooden staff.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the spice piles in the background visibly intensified but still physically plausible, without color bleed, haloing, or loss of individual grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spice piles exhibit vibrant colors that are vivid but remain within the realm of plausibility for naturally dyed spices, suggesting an enhancement rather than distortion. The absence of color bleed, haloing, and loss of individual grain texture reflects careful handling of color intensification during editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the decorative border motif clearly defined, properly aligned with the image’s edge, and positioned without intersecting or distorting any existing elements such as people, stalls, or ground tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative border motif in Image B is distinct and matches the edge of the frame without overlapping into other image elements or causing any visible distortion. Its alignment indicates thoughtful design, ensuring no interference with key visual components like stalls or people.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden box held by the man show consistent wood grain, proper shadowing under ambient light, and natural flower arrangement without distorted petals or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden box displays a consistent wood grain pattern that convincingly represents a natural material. The shadowing appears appropriate for the ambient light conditions, enhancing the realism. The flowers are arranged naturally, with petals and colors that do not seem distorted or artificially shifted; this indicates careful attention to detail in editing.",
