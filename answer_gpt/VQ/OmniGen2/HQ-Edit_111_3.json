      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monochrome line drawings in Image B are designed to illustrate the anatomy of the butterfly. These lines are placed over the wings, antennae, and body to match the butterfly's natural structure. The lines are meant to follow the natural contours of the butterfly's body parts without overlapping incorrectly or causing geometric distortions. Upon inspecting Image B, the lines appear to be correctly aligned and follow the butterfly's structure without creating any distortive effects. Given this observation, the drawings serve their informative purpose without disrupting the visual integrity of the butterfly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pink petals in Image B are likely additions to enhance the visual appeal and context of the butterfly's environment. To assess their integration, one examines the texture, lighting, and shadow alignment of these petals with the existing flora. The petals in Image B show a smooth integration, maintaining consistency in lighting and texture matching the surrounding elements, with no visible seams or artificial edges apparent. This cohesive blending suggests a seamless integration into the overall image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text boxes in Image B provide information related to butterfly biology without disrupting the main visual elements. These boxes are strategically placed around the central butterfly image, avoiding interference with key visual components such as the butterfly and petals. The text is clear and legible, ensuring that it adds informational value without detracting from the visual focus of the image. The balance and placement result in a non-obtrusive integration within the overall composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vibrant blue color of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vibrant blue wings of the butterfly in Image B are a focal point, enhanced by anatomical lines to illustrate butterfly structure. These lines are overlaid, yet the color consistency beneath them is crucial. Upon inspection, the blue color remains uniformly vibrant across the butterfly wings, with no noticeable discoloration or loss of detail even where lines overlay. This preservation ensures the aesthetic and natural appeal of the butterfly's coloring is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures in the areas where edits were made (e.g., line drawings, text boxes, added petals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B undergoes edits to add educational elements like line drawings and text boxes, along with possible enhancements like added petals. It's critical that these edits are seamless and free of visual artifacts to maintain the image's integrity. On inspection, no jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures are visible in the edited areas. The lines and textures appear smooth, indicating a high-quality editing process that respects the natural textures and aligns with the design aesthetic.",
