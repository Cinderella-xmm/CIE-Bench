      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull of the transformed object takes on a unique crystal structure appearance. These crystal forms are defined by their faceted and angular edges. The translucency and iridescent qualities of the crystals on the hull are consistent, without any noticeable blocky or repetitive patterns that are often associated with digital artifacts. The visual appearance aligns with what is expected of crystals in terms of light refraction and color play, indicating a smooth and well-executed transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the transformed structure reveals that areas traditionally associated with windows are represented by faceted gem-like shapes. These faceted shapes have a sharpness and depth that is characteristic of cut gemstones, which naturally reflect and refract light. The depiction is consistent and maintains the aesthetic of crystal or gem structures, consistent with natural and coherent faceted structures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the deck surfaces have been transformed into crystal pathways that appear continuous and well-structured. They integrate seamlessly into the crystal aesthetic without any discernible imperfections such as floating pieces or abrupt transitions. The transition from flat surfaces to angular crystal structures is smooth, maintaining the integrity of the crystal design throughout.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the superstructure exhibits a transformation into angular, faceted crystal forms. These crystals have clean and precise edges, demonstrating care in their geometrical proportions. There are no signs of warping or collapse, as seen in digitally manipulated images, suggesting a well-executed transformation that accurately maintains the proportions typical of sharply cut crystals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background maintains the same landscape with distant islands and horizon line as seen in Image A. There is no evidence of a minimalistic adjustment or removal of distant islands, and the sky and water transition remains consistent without any visual breaks or noticeable changes in brightness. Therefore, the adjustment to the background does not appear to apply as described in this question.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal structure representing the ship is positioned on the water surface with a clear and stable base that does not appear to be floating or misaligned. This suggests that the transformation maintains an appropriate scale relative to the immediate surroundings, such as the waterline and horizon, which fits well into the scene's perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal surfaces in Image B are depicted with detail and precision, and they do not exhibit repetitive textures or blurred edges that might indicate digital artifacts. The edges are sharply defined, contributing to the naturalistic presentation of cut crystal forms without signs of ghosting or synthesis errors commonly seen in poorly executed digital transformations.",
