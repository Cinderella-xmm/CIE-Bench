      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown positioned on the chicken's head in a way that maintains proportional size and natural integration with the skin texture, without visible seams or unnatural lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon chicken is styled in a very animated manner, with exaggerated features typical of cartoon art, including the crown. The crown appears well-proportioned to the head of the chicken and looks natural in the context of the cartoon style. There are no visible seams or imperfections in lighting since the entire image follows a uniform animated style with flat colors and simple shading, which negates issues like unnatural lighting or seams, as would be relevant in a more realistic image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoonish eyes placed symmetrically on the chicken's head with smooth contours and no jagged edges or misaligned shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chicken is drawn in a cartoon style with large, symmetrical eyes. The contours of these eyes are smooth and rounded, which is in keeping with the animated style of the entire image. This indicates that there are no jagged edges, and because of the simplistic shading of cartoons, shadows are minimal and not misaligned. The design aligns with standard practices in cartoon art, where features are typically symmetrical and smoothly rendered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the throne structure beneath the chicken maintain consistent depth and alignment with the plate’s surface, without floating or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the throne is designed in a cartoon style and is intended to provide a background to the chicken as a 'king.' The consistency with the depth is maintained visually, as it looks like the chicken is seating in front of the throne. As the image lacks realistic textures and relies on flat cartoon illustrations, typical concerns like floating or overlapping are less relevant and are visually cohesive in the cartoon context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the anthropomorphic features on the vegetables (such as eyes or limbs) seamlessly blended into their surfaces without visible pixelation, texture breaks, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The secondary characters—cartoon vegetables—display eyes and limbs that are well-integrated into their shapes, consistent with the animated style of the image in Image B. The cartoon nature uses simple, bold outlines and fills that integrate these features effectively without texture issues. There is no pixelation or textural inconsistency because the image uses a cell-shaded technique common in cartoons which doesn't display detailed texture work.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the candles, ornaments, and foliage vivid but free from oversaturation, haloing, or loss of fine detail such as pine needle tips or glass reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a cartoon style with a vivid color palette for items like candles and foliage. In cartoons, colors are typically flat without gradients or detailed textures, hence concerns like oversaturation or haloing in a realistic sense do not apply. This style avoids detail work like pine needle tips and glass reflections as it leans on simplicity over realistic texture rendering. Consequently, the colors appear bright and lively without the artifacts that would concern a more realistic depiction.",
