    "Question": "Q1: Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs are created using LEGO bricks that appear to be uniformly sized and have clean, interlocking edges. There are no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces, indicating a well-constructed LEGO design. This observation is based on the characteristic smooth and precise fit of LEGO bricks as commonly seen in LEGO structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
    "explanation": "The tabletop and chair seats in Image B show a consistent pattern of repeating LEGO studs. This texture is typical of how LEGO bricks are designed, providing even spacing without any unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks. This is concluded from the known design feature of LEGO bricks that have evenly distributed studs for a uniform appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
    "explanation": "The central element in Image B is a LEGO-style plant constructed from green bricks. The leaf shapes are recognizable within the context of LEGO designs, and the plant is positioned directly in the center of the table without any signs of overlapping or floating, adhering to common LEGO structural designs. This interpretation uses the standard positioning practices used in LEGO setups.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the furniture is arranged on a gray LEGO baseplate that fits closely beneath the table and chairs. There is no overhang, and the setup does not show any visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground. This closely follows how LEGO displays are typically designed, where they are placed on a baseplate that integrates with the scene seamlessly.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no prominent artifacts like jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that indicate incomplete rendering or poor integration. The image quality shows clean and precise lines typical of well-rendered LEGO scenes. This assessment applies the common quality standards used in digital LEGO rendering that ensure smooth edges in visuals.",
    "answer": "No"
