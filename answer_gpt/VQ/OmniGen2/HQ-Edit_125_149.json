    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the vertical towers now resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture and leaf coverage, without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towers appear as large figures constructed from wood, resembling tree trunks with a bark-like texture. However, these figures have glowing eyes and tree-like forms, distinct from limbs, and have a decorative rather than structural purpose. The figures are well-integrated and naturally contoured without obvious seams or geometric distortions, showcasing artistic consistency and craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches now formed into a continuous ribcage structure with natural curvature and spacing, free from broken or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ribcage structure is not present as arches; instead, the bridge is reimagined into a single large humanoid figure seamlessly incorporating natural elements like wood and leaves. The uniform wooden texture integument enhances natural curvature without any signs of broken pieces or misalignment. This contributes to the structural coherence, giving it a well-preserved and balanced appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the suspension cables been replaced with vine-like tendrils that show natural growth patterns, such as twisting or clinging, and do they blend with the forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previously visible suspension cables are not discernible; instead, sections of the figure's frame have vine-like elements, presumably acting as cables. These vine-like tendrils display natural patterns, twisting like vines that communicate a lush integration with the surrounding forest environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bridge’s foundations now consist of moss-covered roots extending into the stream, with natural branching and tapering, rather than solid stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the humanoid figure stands atop a base that integrates the stream through an evidently natural pattern, consisting of roots extending and flowing into the water. The moss-covered texture and branching of these roots reinforce the authenticity of a forest environment and contrast with the solid stone base seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bark-textured head structure with two glowing emerald eyes positioned at the top of the bridge, with the glow confined and not causing light bleed or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a humanoid figure with a head structure designed from bark. It features glowing emerald eyes that are well-contained within the form, providing enhanced focus and contrast without causing any light bleed or producing unnatural highlights. The effectiveness of its glow amplifies the mystique yet keeps in harmony with the overarching theme.",
