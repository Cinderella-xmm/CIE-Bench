    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe appears with deliberate fabric folds, consistent with digital artwork style. The draping follows the figureâ€™s contours in a stylized manner typical for illustrations, where fabric does not exhibit the natural complexity of physical textures but isn't unnaturally stretched or clumped for this art form. The consistent patterning reflects an intentional artistic choice rather than an oversight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The limbs and joints of the seated figure in Image B are depicted with simplified lines common in illustrations, focusing more on artistic representation than anatomical precision. The proportions and angles seem reasonable within the constraints of the art style, aiming for expressiveness rather than detailed anatomical accuracy. This results in a visually consistent image without apparent distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In stylized illustrations like Image B, characters sometimes have exaggerated features such as larger eyes. However, the face is stylized with generally proportionate and integrated features, eschewing significant realism for stylistic effect. The facial proportions maintain harmony despite the artistic deviation from realistic features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflections of mountains and lake possess smooth, gradient transitions characteristic of watercolor effects. This painting style blends colors softly to evoke a harmonious, natural scenery rather than sharp, distinct lines, achieving an artistic aesthetic compatible with traditional watercolor artworks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lilac-edged border uniformly applied around the image without overlapping or obscuring any part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a lilac border that is consistently applied around the scenes, visible and unbroken. The border's placement does not intrude upon or obscure any key elements within the artwork, maintaining the integrity of the visual content, thereby providing a clear, distinct framing effect.",
