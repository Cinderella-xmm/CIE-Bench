      "question": "Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is shown from a frontal perspective. The visible structure shows that the lines are straight, and proportionality is preserved, indicating no geometric distortions. World knowledge indicates that a well-designed sofa will have consistent proportions regardless of viewing angle, as furniture is usually constructed to be symmetrical and balanced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the sofa from the front, displaying a uniform texture and fabric detail across its surface. Although the side view is not present, world knowledge suggests that a high-quality image should show consistent clarity and fabric texture detail across different views, especially since the frontal perspective already displays clear textures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B from the frontal view, the cushions are evenly spaced and symmetrically placed, and the legs are clearly visible and well-aligned without appearing distorted or uneven. Since the side view is not provided, world knowledge suggests that for a coherent design, cushions and legs would be expected to maintain natural alignment across views.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frontal perspective in Image B shows light and shadow effects that are consistent and align with a natural light source as shadows fall in a direction consistent with the light coming from the left. Although the side view is not given, knowledge of lighting implies that effects should transition smoothly between views if captured correctly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork on the wall appears visually natural, with colors and shadows that suggest depth and texture that fit well with the lighting. The wall is flat and smooth, consistent with a traditional painted wall surface. Although the side view is unseen, world knowledge implies that the artwork should appear naturally cohesive when viewed from any angle due to its placement and framing.",
