      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the calendar pages clear and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten notes such as 'Birthday', 'Wedding', 'No work', and 'Gym' are clearly visible, combining different colors that stand out against the white calendar paper. The highlighting of certain dates, such as the use of colored circles around them, is done neatly and is free of distortion. The clarity of these markings suggests that they were applied with care and intention, maintaining consistency in appearance and readability.",

      "question": "Do the textures of the paper and desk appear natural and consistent with the lighting and shadows in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the calendar pages looks smooth and fairly consistent with the expected appearance of standard printed paper. The desk underneath has a wood grain, suggesting a natural material. The lighting appears even and does not cast harsh shadows, which helps in maintaining the natural look. There is no indication of unnatural texture mismatches or lighting inconsistencies in the scene.",

      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged neatly without any unnatural breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the calendar pages in Image B is slightly overlapping but each page is fully visible and aligned consistently with others. Despite the overlapping design, there are no unnatural breaks or misalignments; each page retains its rectangular shape, and the dates run consecutively without interruption across the visible portions.",

      "question": "Are the text and grid lines on the calendar pages sharp and well-defined without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text of the calendar months and the numbers of the days appear sharp and crisp. The grid lines separating the days are clearly drawn and well-defined. There is no indication of blurring or pixelation, which denotes high detail preservation in the printing of these elements.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the handwritten notes and highlights consistent and natural, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten notes in Image B use a range of colors, such as blue for 'Birthday', red for 'No work', and green for 'Gym'. The highlights around certain dates also use varied colors like yellow, purple, and blue. These colors are bright and distinguishable without appearing overly saturated or inconsistent with typical markers or highlighters, thus maintaining natural and consistent color usage.",
