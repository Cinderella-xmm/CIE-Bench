      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain of the dog appear naturally integrated into the image without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a chibi-style keychain in a human hand. The keychain is a caricature of a dog, featuring smooth lines and bold colors typical of chibi designs. There are no visible editing artifacts or textures that appear unnatural for a plastic keychain. The design integrates smoothly with the background and the overall composition appears harmonious.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style keychain consistent with the hand holding it, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style keychain is held by a human hand, and its size and structure seem proportionate relative to the hand. The chibi dog figure is appropriately scaled, suggesting the dimensions are reasonable for a keychain meant to be handled easily. There are no evident distortions or deformations in the representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain accurately depict the dog's essential features and characteristics from the original image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A has a Yorkshire Terrier dog which is portrayed in a realistic manner. Image B simplifies these features into a chibi form—an artistic representation rather than realistic—therefore losing specific breed details like fur texture but maintaining the general silhouette and idea of a dog. Given the stylistic shift to chibi, the essential characteristics are altered to fit this aesthetic, making it more abstract than an accurate representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the chibi-style keychain preserved and look natural, without any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain depicted in Image B has a smooth, glossy finish typical of manufactured plastic products, with vibrant colors and simple contours. The texture is consistent with what is expected from such a type of product, with no noticeable loss of detail or unnatural textures. Details expected from a chibi style are preserved.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the connection between the chibi-style keychain and the tiny silver keyring appear natural and physically plausible, without any structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is attached to a small silver keyring via a metallic loop, which is a common design for such items. The connection looks physically probable with no visible gaps or misalignments, suggesting a realistic linkage between the two components. The structural coherence is maintained, and the connection appears secure.",
