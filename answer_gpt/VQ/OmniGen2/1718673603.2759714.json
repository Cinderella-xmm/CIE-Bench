      "question": "Are the roof, walls, and window frames of the Japanese house replaced with colored glass panels outlined by black lead without distorting the original building’s geometry or introducing misaligned or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a scene that resembles a stained glass window. The roof, walls, and window frames are represented as colored glass segments bordered by black lead, typical in stained glass designs. The geometric integrity of the house is maintained, as the straight and precise outlines of the structure in Image B perfectly mimic the shapes in traditional stained glass art, without introducing any distortions or misalignments in the geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the red trees on both sides of the house been converted into symmetrical floral motifs made of red and green glass segments that maintain their original placement and scale without unnatural stretching or fragmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red trees have indeed been represented as symmetrical floral motifs, created with red stained glass segments that reflect the shapes of flowers. These motifs are positioned similarly to the trees in Image A, framing the house symmetrically and maintaining their scale relative to the house as seen in Image A, which shows a coherent scale and position translation without any sign of unnatural stretching or unsightly fragmentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the red moon represented as a series of concentric gradient circles in stained glass style, with smooth color transitions and no jagged edges or irregularities in its form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show the red moon as concentric gradient circles in the stained glass style. The elements are limited to the house and floral motifs without explicit representation of the moon as described, which means that the moon was not included in the stained glass design in the described manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all structural and decorative lines—such as those framing glass panels, outlining windows, and defining floral motifs—uniform, continuous, and properly aligned without breaks, overlaps, or uneven thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observing the outlines and structural lines, they appear uniform and consistent in their thickness, akin to the leading in traditional stained glass designs. The glass panels, window outlines, and floral motifs are framed by clean, continuous, and uniformly thick lines, ensuring the design remains coherent and visually pleasing without breaks or inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections in the water accurately mirror the stained glass version of the house, red floral trees, and red moon with correct proportions, alignment, and color fidelity, without distortion or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears as a stylized stained glass artwork and does not depict any water or reflections. Therefore, there can be no reflection of the stained glass version of the house or any other elements present. This question refers to a feature that is not represented in the edited image.",
