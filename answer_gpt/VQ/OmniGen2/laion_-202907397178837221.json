      "question": "Do the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers align precisely with the original building outlines, showing no distorted edges or misaligned blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers are represented with pixel-patterned facades. These facades appear to be very uniform and consistent, in terms of pixel alignment and structure, covering the building outlines with precision. The alignment of pixels does not seem to display any notable distortion or misalignment that would visibly disrupt the building shapes, utilizing my knowledge of graphical representation precision.",

      "question": "Are the angular digital circuits forming the trees connected logically from base to tip, with no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual appearance of the angular digital circuits forming the trees in Image B shows a coherent structure where the patterns connect logically from base to tip. This reflects a detailed and consistent geometric design where the segments align seamlessly, avoiding any floating parts or disconnected elements. This conclusion is supported by an understanding of how digital designs typically aim for continuity to appear visually effective.",

      "question": "Do the neon lights along the bridge run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels without gaps or incorrect bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts neon lights running along a bridge or road. These lights appear to be designed with a smooth continuity, being consistently depicted along the paths they follow without noticeable gaps or awkward bends. Neon designs often aim for visually appealing continuous lines, supported by graphical consistency.",

      "question": "Are all skyscrapers in the skyline uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, with no partial or missing conversions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skyline in Image B features skyscrapers presented as pixel-patterned luminous towers. The conversion of these buildings appears to be uniform across the skyline, with each maintaining a pixelated presentation from base to peak. The lack of visible omissions or partial conversions indicates a complete transition for each structure, reflecting a consistent graphical style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the window grids on the buildings, the individual beams of the bridge, and the foliage of non-digital trees still clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, features like window grids, bridge beams, and natural foliage have been entirely transformed into a digital, futuristic style, where traditional visual cues such as detailed grids, individual beams, or non-digital foliage do not retain their original appearance. The edit focuses on the transformation into luminous, pixelated patterns, leaving behind the detailed representation seen in Image A.",
