      "question": "Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper depicted on the packaging is an illustrative representation. The body proportions and posture appear correct based on general bird anatomy knowledge. The wings are aligned naturally to the torso and the legs are positioned in a way that mirrors typical avian posture, suggesting balance and symmetry.",

      "question": "Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted wave patterns at the bottom of the packaging feature smooth, flowing curves that seem continuous without visible gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions. This lends the area a natural, pleasing appearance in harmony with the design theme.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The binocular-shaped cut-out window in Image B is well-contoured, with smooth shapes conforming to its theme. The view into the package appears clear, and the internal components are placed logically without any misleading floating or distortion, ensuring everything appears coherent.",
