      "question": "Does the giant manta ray seamlessly replace the surfboard, maintaining the surfer’s pose without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is positioned on what appears to be a giant manta ray instead of a surfboard. The manta ray itself is incorporated in a manner that mimics the size and shape of a surfboard, which seems unnatural given a manta ray's actual proportions. The surfer’s pose appears consistent with that of someone surfing, but the integration of a manta ray as a surfboard creates slight distortions due to the unconventional shape and anatomy of a manta ray compared to a surfboard. These inconsistencies suggest that the interaction is not entirely seamless.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the dreamy atmosphere effects been integrated smoothly, enhancing the image without creating unnatural artifacts or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall atmosphere of Image B, in terms of lighting, color balance, and clarity, appears consistent and smoothly integrated into the scene. The water, sky, and surfer maintain clarity and sharpness, suggesting that the editing does not introduce visible artifacts or lead to a loss in detail. The dreamy quality is enhanced subtly without detracting from the realism of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interaction between the manta ray and the waves visually credible, avoiding any apparent breaks in texture or geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interaction between a large manta ray and ocean waves should logically take into account the natural behavior and appearance of a manta ray in water. Observing Image B, there are areas where the manta ray's surface interacts with the waves, but there are visible discrepancies between the wave textures and the placement of the manta ray, especially around its tail and wings, which create unrealistic breaks in the water surface. Such visual differences lead to the perception of an unnatural integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the size and shape of the manta ray align naturally with the scale of the surfboard and surfer, avoiding disproportionate or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Manta rays are generally quite large in reality, but for surfing purposes, they would not align with the size or shape needed to function as a realistic surfboard. In Image B, the manta ray replaces the surfboard, but its size and shape appear strained and disproportionate relative to the actual size of a typical surfboard and surfer, leading to a visual discrepancy that suggests unrealistic scaling.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and edges of the manta ray free of visible artifacts, maintaining smooth transitions and natural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture and edges of the manta ray in Image B should visually align with natural underwater images of the creature, displaying smooth transitions and details without abrupt changes or visible editing artifacts. While much of the manta ray's body maintains detailed textures, there are some inconsistencies in how the edges and certain textures blend with the water, making them appear slightly edited. These small irregularities suggest the presence of artifacts.",
