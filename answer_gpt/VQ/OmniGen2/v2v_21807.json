      "question": "Are the clock faces and architectural details of the tower clearly visible and structurally consistent despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces are clearly illustrated, featuring distinct hour markings and hands, set within a simplified architectural representation. The design captures essential structural elements like the pointed roof and base pillars. This clarity and consistency align with common visual expectations of cartoon style, where essential details are maintained for recognition while overall complexity is reduced.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding elements retain their natural textures without any noticeable loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the clock tower and surroundings in a cartoon style, which inherently simplifies textures into solid colors and smooth gradients. The natural stone and foliage textures seen in Image A are replaced with flat colors, which is typical in cartoons to emphasize form over texture. Thus, there is a noticeable alteration in detail retention, typical of this style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image avoid introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions in the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains clean and smooth lines without any unintended distortions or artifacts. The transformation into a cartoon style does not introduce noise or visual errors; instead, it presents a deliberate artistic alteration that remains coherent and realistic within the cartoon context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the clock tower and its surroundings logically maintained in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon image, the tower's proportions relative to its surroundings such as the road and cars are consistent with real-life expectations. Despite the change in artistic style, the spatial relationships are preserved, allowing viewers to recognize the scene's logical setting within the cartoon framework.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the clock tower and its surroundings remain intact and undistorted in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon rendering in Image B features well-defined geometric shapes, maintaining the integrity of the clock tower and its surroundings. While stylized, the shapes and angles are consistent without any distortions, preserving the essence of the original structure.",
