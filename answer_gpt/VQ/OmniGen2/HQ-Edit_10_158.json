      "question": "Are the wood grain patterns across the surface of the boot evenly distributed and consistent with natural wood textures, avoiding artificial or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot's surface is designed to mimic wood textures, which involves creating grain patterns that resemble the natural and irregular patterns found in wood. By closely observing these patterns, one can judge whether they appear evenly distributed and natural or if they look artificial and repetitive. From the visual cues, the wood grain on Image B appears consistent and natural, maintaining the irregularities common in real wood surfaces. Therefore, based on the analysis of the texture, it can be concluded that the designs avoid artificial or repetitive patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transitions between light and dark wood tones on the boot follow the same contour and depth as the original leather and rubber sections, ensuring no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot's transition of wood tones is inspected by checking the contour and depth of color changes across the boot. The representation should flow smoothly to imitate the natural color gradients found in leather or rubber materials. Observing the image, the color transitions appear smooth and follow the contour lines similar to the original shape and sections of the boot. This suggests that the artist has paid attention to maintaining the realistic shifts in tones, avoiding any abrupt or unrealistic changes.",

      "question": "Are the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas shaped precisely like the original metal hardware and fabric loops, without deformation or missing structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the boot retains lacing holes and the reinforcement areas that resemble the original metal hardware and fabric loops. One focuses on the precision of these features, ensuring they are intact without deformation or missing elements. Comparing to general knowledge of boot design, the lacing holes and reinforcements in Image B appear to be well-formed and precise, avoiding any irregular shapes or structural loss.",

      "question": "Is the wooden shelf flat, stable, and properly aligned beneath the boot, with no visible warping, floating, or unsupported edges that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot is resting on a wooden shelf that should be assessed for stability and proper alignment. One looks for cues of flatness, stability, and logical physical support. The visual analysis of the shelf shows it being flat and aligned, with both edges supporting the boot uniformly without signs of warping, floating, or unsupported edges, thus adhering to physical logic.",

      "question": "Does the boot retain its original three-dimensional shape, including toe box, heel, and ankle support, without any stretching, flattening, or irregular bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B needs a close inspection of the overall shape of the boot, focusing on key areas like the toe box, heel, and ankle support. These regions should retain the boot's original three-dimensional form to ensure its visual integrity. Observing Image B, the boot holds its three-dimensional shape well, with no stretching, flattening, or bulges visible, maintaining the structural elements expected of a fully formed boot.",
