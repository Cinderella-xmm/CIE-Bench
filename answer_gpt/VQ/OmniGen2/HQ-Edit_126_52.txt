    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus has a stylized design with noticeable crystalline features at its tip, where these luminous, faceted structures appear to be aligned with the cactus ribs. The distribution appears uniform with no visible gaps or overlapping clusters, as they maintain a structured and organized appearance, following the natural lines seen in a typical cactus structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is adorned with luminous glyphs along its surface. These glyphs are positioned in line with the ribs, complementing the design, and appear to emit a controlled, soft glow. This illumination is subtle and does not cause any overexposure or halo effects, providing a harmonious appearance that enhances the visual appeal without overwhelming the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal supporting the cactus appears to be made from textured sandstone, modeled in a way that gives it a grounded presence. Although it is placed on sand rather than a wooden surface, this setting supports the natural integration. There are no visible signs of the edges being unnaturally clipped or floating. The pedestal's base merges well with the sand, maintaining the scene's realism.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus-like structure features amber-like eyes or openings embedded symmetrically within its ribs. This placement and the internal glow are done skillfully, providing a look of balance, and the design avoids any distortion of the surrounding areas. The illumination appears internal and contained, further enhancing symmetry and ensuring the rest of the cactus structure remains undistorted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vine tendrils appear around the base of the cactus, curling naturally in a way that suggests they are anchored to the stone-like pedestal. These tendrils possess a fluid and organic curve, seamlessly integrating with the base's texture, indicating no unnatural floating or rigid, artificial positioning, thus maintaining the organic flow expected in such natural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
