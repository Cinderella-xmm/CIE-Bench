    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the original building is replaced by a large robot. Observing the robot, it displays smooth and consistent geometric proportions with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body. The joints and surfaces are properly defined, consistent with the design of a futuristic robot. This reflects a well-edited integration, considering realistic mechanical and structural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "The stylized shoulder pads on the robot in Image B are integrated seamlessly, featuring clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns. They do not appear stretched or fragmented; instead, they fit well within the robot's design, maintaining symmetry with the rest of its structure. This demonstrates the well-done editing ensuring cohesion in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the traffic signs appear as part of the futuristic theme but do not clearly exhibit holographic effects like glow or transparency. They maintain their original design without alterations suggesting futuristic effects. Therefore, there seems to be no evidence of light leaks or unnatural color shifts affecting adjacent areas due to these signs.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "The robotic pedestrians in Image B display correctly proportioned limbs and body shapes that follow geometric logic. Each limb appears well-structured with a coherent mechanical design. However, their hands do not display five fingers per hand, which deviates from typical humanoid designs. This indicates a slight inconsistency compared to a complete humanoid form.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the robotic figures and the transformed building align with the sunlight direction from the top-left corner. The shadows are consistent with the setting and line up naturally with surrounding objects. This demonstrates attention to realistic light interactions within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
