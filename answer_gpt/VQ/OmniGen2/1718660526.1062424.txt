    "Question": "Q1: Does the body of the animal consist of small, uniformly sized glossy ceramic tiles arranged in a consistent pattern that follows the contours of the original form without gaps or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents an animal-shaped object whose body is covered with small, glossy ceramic tiles. These tiles are uniformly sized and are consistently arranged to follow the contours of the original form. The visual cues show no gaps or misalignment, indicating careful craftsmanship. This interpretation is derived from the smooth appearance and reflective quality of the tiles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the eyes composed of precisely shaped tiles forming distinct white sclera and black pupils, maintaining their original size and position relative to the snout and head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are made from shaped tiles. These tiles form distinct regions of white sclera and black pupils. They maintain their original size, proportion, and placement relative to the snout and head, indicating accuracy in the preservation of facial features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the stripes across the body maintain uniform width and spacing, with clear transitions between vibrant orange and deep black tiles that match the original pattern?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows stripes that maintain uniform width and spacing. The transitions between vibrant orange and deep black tiles are clear, reflecting the original pattern. This assessment is based on the consistent visual appearance across the body, which is important for maintaining the stylized aesthetic of the tiger pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the surface beneath the animal a textured sandy platform with visible granular detail and subtle moisture variation, providing a tactile contrast to the smooth mosaic tiles?",
    "explanation": "The surface in Image B beneath the animal appears as a sandy platform with visible textural detail. Granular texture is evident, but the level of moisture variation isn't starkly depicted; however, the tactile contrast between the smooth tiles and the grainy sand is clear. This contrast provides a realistic foundation for the animal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the limbs and joints of the animal smoothly contoured with no jagged edges, distorted shapes, or missing tiles that would suggest structural inconsistency or rendering errors?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows limbs and joints that are smoothly contoured, without any jagged edges or distorted shapes. No missing tiles are observed, ensuring an intact structural representation. This conclusion is drawn from the coherent transition across the tiled surface, indicating precision in design and rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
