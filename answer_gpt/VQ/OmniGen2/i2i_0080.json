      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the dog's fur consistent and natural across both the left side and back views in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur is visualized with consistent textures, presenting a smooth, animated appearance typical of cartoon illustration. The fur's color and shading are uniform between the left side and back views of the dog, reflecting a coherent texture style that's appropriate for a cartoon dog. The explanation process involves assessing visual uniformity and texture consistency, typical of stylized art, in both views.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog maintain appropriate proportions between its front and back views without noticeable distortion or deformation in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated with correct proportions, as its left side and back views are consistent with each other, showing a balanced alignment and anatomy typical of cartoon art. The dog's head, body, tail, and legs exhibit a proportional relationship that fits natural expectations for a dog of this style. The reasoning involves evaluating the size and arrangement of body parts to ensure they align properly between different views.",

      "question": "Does the dog appear naturally positioned on the bed in both the left side and back views within the combined image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is positioned on the bed with both views showing it seated comfortably, with its feet aligned to the bed’s surface and body centered appropriately. This logical positioning in both views creates a credible scene as it matches our understanding of how a dog would naturally sit on a bed, contributing to visual harmony within the artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the dog's ears and tail retain clear details and natural textures without any unnatural artifacts in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both views show the dog's ears and tail with clear, consistent cartoon-style textures, free from artifacts or distortions. The ears have well-defined borders and shading, while the tail retains its typical pointed, lively shape. The reasoning involves analyzing the clarity and integrity of these details against expectations for cartoon illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the overall aesthetics of the combined image maintain a natural and authentic appearance without any obvious inconsistencies between the dog’s left side and back views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall aesthetic between the dog’s left side and back views is coherent, with the same cartoon style maintained across both perspectives. The proportions, textures, and colors align well, presenting a harmonious image. The appearance lacks noticeable inconsistencies, preserving the integrity typical of professional cartoon art. The conclusion requires assessing the uniformity and stylistic cohesion across different views, ensuring the aesthetic maintains visual continuity.",
