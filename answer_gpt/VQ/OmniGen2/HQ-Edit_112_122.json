    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress clearly defined, proportionally consistent with the garment’s scale, and free from jagged edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the dress does not feature any floral patterns; the dress is smooth and consists of a solid color scheme with flowing lines that create a sense of movement and elegance. No jagged edges or pixelation artifacts are visible, which suggests a high-quality digital rendering achieving uniformity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lighting from the top right cast soft gradients on the woman’s face, dress, and nearby flowers without causing unnatural overexposure or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows lighting effects that emphasize soft gradients and illumination on the dress and flowers. The light cascades into the scene, maintaining a natural appearance without causing overexposure. This lighting contributes to the illusion of depth and harmony in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floating petals distributed evenly in mid-air, showing natural dispersion and depth, with no clustered or floating-in-place anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the petals appear well-distributed across the composition, offering a sense of motion and depth. They complement the scene’s dynamic flow and are spaced naturally without noticeable clustering, adding to a harmonious visual effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral vines forming the writing area extend naturally from surrounding plants, maintaining consistent thickness, color, and growth direction without abrupt starts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the floral vines for the writing area seem naturally integrated into the design. They maintain consistent thickness and coloration, flowing smoothly as part of the frame, which contrasts the background imagery without abrupt interruptions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s left hand show five distinct fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does the hand appear attached correctly to the arm without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the depiction of the woman's left hand seems to lack some detailing. There are challenges in distinguishing individual fingers with accuracy due to the hand’s simplified rendering, suggesting room for improvement in anatomical precision.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
