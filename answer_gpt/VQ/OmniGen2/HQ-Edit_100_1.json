      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tree in the edited image maintain natural branch proportions and trunk thickness relative to the surrounding elements, without appearing unnaturally shrunk or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is part of a diorama-like art piece, with exaggerated and stylized proportions for artistic effect. The branches are thick and somewhat abstract, not maintaining the proportions typically found in a natural tree but aligning with the art style. Given that it is intentionally made to look like a faux or simplified representation, it does not conform to natural branch proportions. Therefore, it appears shrunk or warped by realistic standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the tree's bark and leaves consistent with natural materials, showing no signs of digital over-enhancement such as repeating patterns or unnatural gloss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree in Image B is crafted from artificial materials, likely fabric or foam for the leaves and a smooth material for the bark, not resembling natural textures. It is expected to have a uniform, simplified texture by design, as seen in miniature or craft representations. Consequently, it lacks the complexity and intricacy of natural materials but fits within the expectations of man-made art. Thus, the textures do not suggest digital over-enhancement but rather deliberate stylization.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the flower patches beneath the tree uniformly distributed and blended into the existing meadow, without visible cloning artifacts, sharp edges, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B are part of a carefully crafted diorama-like scene. They are arranged deliberately rather than naturally spread. The distribution does not have visible artifacts since they are real physical elements and not digitally cloned, which avoids the typical artifacts of digital enhancement. Their bright, contrasting colors indicate a non-natural, manufactured look consistent with the overall artistic style of the diorama.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the tree seamlessly blended, with no visible layering lines, color jumps, or flat regions that break the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is intentionally flat and simple, characteristic of artistic dioramas or shadow boxes. The colored back panel has a cartoonish and stylized appearance rather than attempting realism or depth. This presentation is intentional and doesn't indicate blending errors but rather a distinct lack of depth as part of its design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cloud figures positioned above the scene on thin, non-visible wires, appearing small and light enough to suggest suspension, without overlapping or intersecting with the tree or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are tiny, crafted elements that are part of the diorama. They hang from what appears to be non-visible wires, consistent with their small size and lightweight appearance, suggesting suspension. They do not intersect with the tree or the ground, maintaining their place in the background as intended.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame clearly visible around the scene with consistent material appearance, straight edges, and proper shadowing that indicates a three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden frame in Image B is clearly visible, with straight edges and a consistent wood grain pattern that suggests a solid material. The shadowing within the box further supports the perception of depth, indicating that it is a three-dimensional structure rather than a flat image. This complements the enclosed scene inside, confirming its diorama-like setup.",
