      "question": "Does the transformed house maintain consistent geometric shapes without jagged edges, overlapping planes, or unnatural fragmentation that disrupts structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house facade features a vibrant geometric pattern with clear, distinct shapes like triangles and rectangles. These geometric shapes are consistent in form and do not display jagged edges or overlapping planes that could disrupt the visual coherence. The deliberate design maintains structural integrity, with each shape fitting seamlessly into the overall pattern without fragmentation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract representations of the crowd evenly distributed across their original positions without clustering or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd is visually represented in a similar manner to Image A, maintaining their general distribution on the hillside without illogical clustering or spacing. The alteration focuses more on the house, and the crowd remains in their spatially logical positions, standing on the ground without floating elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the checkered pattern applied uniformly across the entire grass surface without visible seams, inconsistent spacing, or distortion at edges near sand traps and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no checkered pattern applied to the grass surface in Image B. The grass remains its original texture and appearance as seen in Image A. Since there is no pattern applied, the question of uniformity, seams, or distortion does not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky in fragmented but coherent angular segments without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in the water in Image B appears to reflect the modified facade of the house and the sky above. While the house exhibits geometric patterns, these patterns (if reflected) should be consistent. However, abstract fragment reflections are not evident or clear in the water, so it can't be analyzed for coherence, ghosting, or color separation in the form described.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vibrant geometric planes on the houseâ€™s facade consistently lit and shaded to match the ambient light direction, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric planes on the facade of the house have consistent lighting that matches the ambient light direction observed in the overall scene. The vibrant colors and shapes do not show unnatural highlights or shadows that would indicate mismatched lighting. The shading respects the original positioning of the house concerning the light source.",
