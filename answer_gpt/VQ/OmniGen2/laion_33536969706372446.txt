    "Question": "Q1: Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?",
    "explanation": "The burgundy drapes in Image B are designed to hang down with elegant folds that appear smooth, which is typical of heavy fabric hanging naturally. The shadow gradients align well with realistic lighting assumptions, showing a gradual transition from light to dark that enhances the perception of depth in the drapery. The presence of shadows on the adjacent wall and floor that correspond to the position and fall of drapes further supports the natural look and realistic lighting in the scene.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?",
    "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are consistent with the lighting source direction, likely from the ceiling area, and follow a logical pattern across both walls and floor surfaces. The way the shadows fall and the angles at which they spread indicate an understanding of how light interacts with structures, supporting the claims of realistic lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the redesigned canopy bed is well-positioned within the room's confines. The bed doesnâ€™t exceed the ceiling height or wrongly overlap with the walls, which preserves the spatial organization. Moreover, the proportions and scale of the bed are in harmony with nearby furniture such as the nightstand and rug, which is crucial for maintaining an authentic room setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
