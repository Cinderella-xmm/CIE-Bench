      "question": "Are the engraved patterns on the transformed tagine's surface smooth and continuous, without visible artifacts such as broken lines, abrupt color shifts, or unnatural texture blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the tagine features intricate engraved patterns. To determine if the patterns are smooth and continuous, one must look for any signs of imperfections such as broken lines or abrupt transitions. The patterns appear well-integrated with smooth lines and consistent color, without visible artifacts. These indicators suggest a smooth and continuous design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the extended spout emerge seamlessly from the top of the tagine, maintaining consistent curvature and structural continuity without any visible gaps, warping, or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tagine is modified with an extended spout. One needs to check if the spout appears to naturally extend from the main body of the tagine without any inconsistent transitions or distortions. The spout displays a coherent curvature and blends seamlessly with the tagine's top, showing no visible gaps or scaling issues, indicating structural continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the smoke beneath the tagine rendered with soft diffusion and layered opacity, showing realistic lighting effects and no sharp outlines or blocky textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B can be evaluated by observing its diffusion and lighting. Realistic smoke would have soft edges and a gradient-like opacity effect, rather than sharp contrasts. The image shows smoke with well-diffused edges and natural-looking light effects, suggesting layered opacity and realistic rendering without sharp or blocky textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floating orbs derived from the original ingredients (such as lemon, lime, garlic) maintain recognizable shapes and emit a soft glow without visible rendering artifacts like haloing, misaligned highlights, or floating disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating orbs in Image B are visually different from the original ingredients in Image A. These orbs should be checked for their shape recognition and glow effect. They emit a consistent, soft glow and maintain spherical shapes without misalignments or disconnected fragments, indicating they are well-rendered.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the materials of the transformed tagine (ceramic body, engraved surface) and surrounding elements (floating orbs, smoke) visually consistent with their expected physical properties, without unnatural sheen, flat shading, or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The evaluation involves analyzing the materials' visual consistency with ceramic and other elements' expected textures. The tagine's body, engravings, orbs, and smoke all exhibit appropriate textural detail and lighting effects. The ceramic has a natural sheen, the engravings are detailed, the orbs glow softly, and smoke appears naturally, all without flat shading or loss of detail, indicating material consistency.",
