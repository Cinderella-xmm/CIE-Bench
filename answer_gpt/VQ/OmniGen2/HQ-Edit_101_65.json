      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry in Image B looks proportional and meticulously detailed.

      "question": "Do the newly added elements in the background (stars, luminous flowers, lanterns) follow consistent lighting direction and depth cues without creating visual inconsistencies or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as stars, flowers, and lanterns are integrated with an understanding of depth and lighting. The lanterns cast light appropriately, and the flowers have a glow that suggests they are illuminated by the moon or nearby light sources. The stars in the sky and the composition indicate a uniform light direction, which preserves the sceneâ€™s realism and avoids the impression of floating elements.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands depicted in Image B seem anatomically accurate, with each hand showing five fingers and natural joint alignment.
