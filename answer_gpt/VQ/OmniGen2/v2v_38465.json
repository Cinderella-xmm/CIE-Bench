      "question": "Are the pandas holding the surfboards seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the pandas do seem to fit well within the overall scene. However, considering common editing techniques, human skin texture replaced with panda fur may exhibit unnatural patches or digital artifacts. The necessity to analyze the integration with the sunset lighting and shadow casting might reveal any irregularities but cannot be seen in this version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfboards held by the pandas maintain their original shape and proportions without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfboards appear stable and consistent without noticeable distortions. Using real-world knowledge, surfboards have distinct geometric features and, with close examination, the shape and fixed proportions recognizable from Image A are maintained in Image B. There is no sign of skewing or deformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pandas' postures and positioning appear natural and consistent with the beach and sunset environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From analyzing Image B, the pandas are standing in typical postures for someone holding surfboards parallel to the shoreline. The placement of the pandas and surfboards syncs with real-world understanding of casual beach-going activities, capturing a non-dissonant stance that agrees with sunset photography norms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the sunset and beach setting remained intact and visually credible without any alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background setting showcases a captivating sunset over the ocean clearly depicted without abnormalities or visual glitches. Employing world knowledge related to digital imagery, such consistent elements like wave patterns and horizon alignment usually indicate unaltered background environments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas' sizes relative to the surfboards and the environment proportionally realistic and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's representation of pandas holding surfboards displays sizes that follow believable proportions. Using basic physics and real-life scale comparisons for humans and objects, the modified panda figures are comparable to standard human dimensions when paired with surfboards and settings, maintaining a plausible scene.",
