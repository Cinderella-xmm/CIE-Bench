    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the statue exhibit a consistent clay-like texture across all body parts, including the face, limbs, and torso, without visible patches of mismatched material or unnatural graininess?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B appears to have a uniform clay-like texture throughout its body parts, as the surface seems smooth and cohesive. The lighting adds to the perception of this consistency, and no mismatched material patches or unnatural grains are visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with no visible distortion of the statue's shape or features behind it, and does it display natural reflections and refractions consistent with real glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears fully transparent, allowing a clear view of the statue inside without altering its shape or features. It also exhibits natural reflections and refractions, such as highlights on its surface, aligning with characteristics of real glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome evenly spaced, clearly defined, and integrated smoothly into the surface without overlapping or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not include lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome; it is depicted as a smooth and clear surface without any such decorations. Therefore, the question does not accurately apply to the depiction in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights under the spotlight without visible halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trident, snake, and drum in Image B appear to have well-managed golden highlights that enhance their visibility. There are no apparent halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas, indicating that the lighting is balanced and effective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the muscle contours on the statueâ€™s arms, chest, and legs accurately shaded with smooth gradients that follow the underlying anatomy and directional light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in Image B reveals muscle contours that are well-defined with smooth shading gradients, implying an understanding of anatomy. The shadows and highlights also suggest a directional light source that enhances the three-dimensional effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the incense holders positioned at ground level around the base of the pedestal, correctly scaled, and free from floating or clipping against other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any incense holders positioned around the base of the pedestal. Therefore, there is no issue of scaling or clipping against other structures as these elements are absent.",
