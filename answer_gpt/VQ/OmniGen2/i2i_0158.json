      "question": "Do the transitions between the front, left side, and rear views of the car appear smooth and free of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is presented in three distinct views: front, left side, and rear. These views should smoothly transition into one another without any clear visual discrepancies. The placement and orientation of car elements like headlights, wheels, and logos should naturally correspond to each view. Given that the images portray a clear, industry-standard presentation where each view is isolated, the transitions appear to be autonomously consistent within each view. Thus, without direct comparison to Image A but following conventional knowledge of car presentations, these transitions seem smooth and free from unnatural artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the car parts consistent and logical across the three views without showing any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases three aspects of the car that should logically maintain constant proportions and angles relative to one another, preserving the inherent design of the vehicle. For instance, the wheels should align across views in terms of size and position, and the body lines should not betray any warping or skewing which would imply distortion. Observing each segment of the car in Image B, these details adhere to normal car design principles, showing no obvious signs of distortion or mismatch in angles and proportions that would defy typical design coherence.",

      "question": "Does the car's surface texture and material properties, like reflections and shine, appear uniform and realistic across all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects a consistent visual representation of the surface texture and material characteristics. The car continues to showcase a polished finish across every view indicated by similar reflections and shine, which are aligned with how light typically interacts with a glossy car surface under typical conditions. This consistency is important to maintaining the realism of the depiction, and in Image B, these properties appear uniformly across the illustrated views.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow effects consistent and correctly aligned across all three views of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the lighting and shadows in each view appear consistent with the light sources as they are uniformly applied across the front, side, and rear views. This entails similar shadow angles and lighting intensity, indicative of a coherent setting. Consistency in lighting is crucial for presenting a realistic portrayal of an object in multiple views, and Image B adheres to these principles by maintaining alignment across the different angles of the car.",

      "question": "Does the background seamlessly integrate with the car without introducing any jarring inconsistencies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background primarily serves to enhance the presentation of the car without introducing distracting or incongruous elements. The neutral, minimalistic backdrop is typical for a display of this nature, focusing attention on the vehicle itself. It integrates without any visible artifacts or transitions that would cause a visual discontinuity or jarring effect against the carâ€™s design, thus presenting a seamless integration.",
