    "Question": "Q1: Does the text 'Sharp' at the top left blend naturally into the image without causing any visible disruption to the scissors or background?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a pair of scissors rendered in a sketch style, which is black and white with bold outlines. The text 'Sharp' is placed at the top left and does not overlap with the scissors or disrupt the background because it exists independently. Thus, it integrates into the overall black-and-white sketch style of the image, not causing any interruption to the main elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the text 'Clean' at the bottom right rendered in a sketch style that matches the image's aesthetic, without introducing any artifacts or visual noise?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the scissors and the text 'Clean' are rendered in a consistent black-and-white sketch style with bold lines, matching the overall aesthetic of the image. There are no noticeable artifacts or visual noise introduced by this text, preserving the sketch-like essence of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions of the scissors preserved, with no apparent distortion in their shape caused by the placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
    "explanation": "The scissors are the central element of Image B, depicted in a sketch style similar to Image A. The placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean' does not interfere with or distort the proportions or the shape of the scissors. The texts are positioned in areas that do not directly affect the scissors, keeping the proportions intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the fine details, like reflections and edges of the scissors, remain sharp and unaffected by the presence of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the scissors in a stylized sketch form, so the expectation of details like reflections and edges is different compared to Image A. The bold lines within the sketch ensure the continuity of edge definition and style. The presence of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean' does not affect these intrinsic sketch details, allowing them to remain sharp within this art style context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the composition of the image, including the positioning of the scissors and the added texts, appear balanced and maintain visual plausibility?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scissors are centered, with balanced positioning that naturally draws the viewerâ€™s focus. The text 'Sharp' at the top left and 'Clean' at the bottom right are placed to complement rather than overpower the scissors, creating a composition that maintains visual plausibility through symmetric balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
