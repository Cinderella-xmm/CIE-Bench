    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the sun disc replacing the Sphinx’s head seamlessly integrated with the neck and body, showing no jagged edges or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun disc appears well-integrated with the neck and body. The contours look smooth and consistent with the stylistic choices of the edited image, and there are no visible jagged edges or misalignments. This suggests a deliberate and skillful integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden wings extend symmetrically from the sides of the Sphinx’s body with smooth, continuous surfaces and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden wings appear to extend symmetrically from either side of the Sphinx's body. The surfaces of the wings are smooth, and their curvature follows a natural flow. This symmetry and continuity are indicative of careful placement and editing to maintain aesthetic appeal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sand flows on the limbs continuous and gravity-consistent, without abrupt breaks or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand flows along the limbs of the figure, maintaining a consistent flow that aligns with gravity. There are no abrupt breaks or segments that appear to be floating, indicating that the edit respects the natural flow of sand.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ankhs on the paws correctly shaped, properly scaled, and emitting a soft, localized glow without distorting adjacent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ankhs held by the figure appear to be correctly shaped and proportionately sized in relation to the figure’s paws. The glow they emit is soft and localized, and it does not distort the textures around them, suggesting a balanced and precise edit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire edited figure exhibit consistent lighting and shading across all added elements, with no visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shading are consistent across the entire figure, including all added elements like the golden wings and the sun disc. This uniformity ensures that there are no visible seams or mismatches in texture, pointing to a cohesive and well-executed edit.",
