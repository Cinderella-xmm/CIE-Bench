    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is presented in a 3D cartoon style within a framed display that mimics a card layout. The circular form of the thermometer remains symmetrical and accurate. The numerical markings and pointer are clear, and there is no evidence of distortions or broken geometry. The overall cartoon style does not compromise the structural integrity or the readability of the thermometer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the thermometer features soft lighting that creates natural highlights and shadows, suggesting a metallic finish. These effects enhance the appearance by giving it a polished and realistic look, and there is no introduction of unnatural textures or a blurring of important details such as numerical labels or the pointer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not explicitly display stats such as [Temperature Range +200] or [Accuracy +10°C]. The current alterations include stylization and framing in a blue card design, but no additional stats are superimposed on the thermometer. Hence, clutter or distortion from stats integration is not applicable here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Presision Thermal Guage' is placed at the top of the card design in a prominent and easily readable font, while the nameplate text 'NER MEN+ +LOK' is located below the thermometer, both framed within designated blue areas. Despite a typographical error ('Presision' should be 'Precision'), the positioning is logical, and the elements do not disrupt the layout. However, the misspelled words might slightly reduce visual credibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B's design features crisp blue borders framing the thermometer, with a cool-toned dark blue background. These elements provide a professional and modern aesthetic that complements the thermometer, suggesting a tech-oriented or scientific theme. The clean lines and consistent color palette help to maintain the card's authenticity and coherence, without introducing any visual artifacts that detract from its appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
