      "question": "Does the lattice-like scale pattern along the serpent's body follow the spiral curve smoothly without abrupt breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body displays a pattern of scales. By observing the smooth continuity of the scales, we can infer that they follow the serpentine curve without abrupt breaks or misalignments. The scales are evenly arranged and symmetrically aligned, enhancing the illusion of continuity and flow along the spiral structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the individual segments of the serpent's body aligned with the original stair treads such that each segment corresponds to a step in size and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent is largely seen coiling up the staircase. The serpent appears to weave in and out of the staircase, and it is not segmented such that each portion corresponds neatly with a step. Its body extends beyond the boundaries of individual treads and does not align precisely with the stairs.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the translucent fins extend from the original railing position in a continuous, flowing manner without gaps or distortions in their shape or placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the serpent lacks fins or similar extensions. The edited image maintains the continuity of the railings, focusing instead on the serpent's smooth scales. Hence, no translucent fins extend from the railing position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting and shading of the original staircase surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the staircase has a consistent marble texture, likely to portray luxury and elegance. The serpent's scales do not feature a marble-like texture similar to the staircase; rather, they have a detailed, reflective scale texture distinct from the marble surface. This indicates inconsistency between the serpent's texture and the staircase's marble-like texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s head positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase without overlapping or deforming the surrounding wall or ceiling structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s head is indeed positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase, positioned prominently, maintaining harmony with the elements of the staircase. There is no visible overlap or deformation of the wall or ceiling, suggesting careful positioning.",
