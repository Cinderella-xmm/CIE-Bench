      "question": "Do the shrunk vegetables retain their natural texture and fine details without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables are located in the left dish, unchanged and looking raw. The dish on the right contains orange liquid, possibly soup. Since Image B doesn't feature shrunk vegetables, the comparison to Image A reveals no texture change or artifact introduction, as Image A shows roasted vegetables instead.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shapes of the shrunk vegetables proportionate and physically plausible, avoiding any unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays whole, unaltered vegetables. The dish on the right contains liquid, likely soup. With no shrinkage occurring in Image B, it's evident no distortion presents. The comparison to Image A highlights this through the lack of transformation like in the roasted vegetables.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shrinkage preserve the natural colors and material appearance of the vegetables without introducing any artificial tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vegetables appear unprocessed on the left, their natural colors visible. On the right, liquid is present. No shrinkage or tone change is present in Image B, maintaining natural appearance. Image A, featuring roasted vegetables, demonstrates tone change not present in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement of the shrunk vegetables consistent with the original structure, maintaining visual credibility within the dish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B holds unprocessed vegetables within a dish, with a liquid dish beside it. Without size reduction, structural arrangements stay credible. Image A's rearranged roasted vegetables contrast this through their altered size and layout.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the edges and geometric shapes of the shrunk vegetables remained intact, avoiding any broken or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays raw vegetables in their natural form, without shrinkage. The dish on the right containing liquid doesn't affect the edges of the vegetables on the left, which retain their original form, unshaped in any edited manner. Image A, showcasing roasted vegetables, demonstrates the edge modification not apparent in Image B.",
