      "question": "Does the orb or capsule at the creature's feet blend naturally with the green and floral theme without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orb or capsule is distinctly different from the rest of the elements. It is placed beside the bear on a floral plate and stands out due to its bright red color and the eye-like design, which does not naturally blend with the green jelly bear or the floral pattern. The difference in style and color suggests it is an added element, contrasting with the rest of the theme.",

      "question": "Are the creature's name and elemental type seamlessly integrated into the image without disrupting the visual flow or introducing any unnatural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'INGUER PLEMAKN' and the subsequent description are visually separated from the main visual element, which is the bear and plate. The text appears to be floating below the image and does not blend seamlessly with the design, as it introduces a different style and element that is not part of the natural scene depicted above.",

      "question": "Does the creature's design retain the rounded form and whimsical vibe of the gummy bear without any distorted or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the rounded and whimsical form of the gummy bear with smooth curves and a playful shape. There are no signs of distortion or unnatural shapes in the bear itself; its limbs, face, and body maintain a playful and cohesive form, much like typical gummy bear designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral decorations around the plate enhance the visual appeal without degrading the fine details of the petals or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral pattern is part of the plate's design, complementing the visual layout. The flowers are stylized, and while not hyper-realistic, they fit the overall aesthetic without degrading fine details or introducing unnatural textures. The design blends well with the thematic context of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the creature's limbs and body consistent with the original gummy bear's form, avoiding any distortion or unnatural geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the proportions in Image B, the bear maintains a consistent and rational form similar to traditional gummy bears. The limbs are symmetrically rounded, and the body shape is uniform without distortion or unnatural geometry. It fits the expected gummy bear proportions, ensuring coherence in its design.",
