      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra sharp and distinct without any unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear in stark contrast, remaining clear and defined, which suggests an absence of blurring or pixelation around the edges of the stripes. My analysis is based on the visual clarity of these patterns, which indicates the stripes are distinct and sharp as they maintain their structure without any degradation or fuzziness affecting their definition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's fur textures appear natural without any visible artificial streaks or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B for the zebra's fur texture, the fur appears smooth and lacks the natural grain and subtle variations usually present in real fur. Instead, the image reveals uniform lines without the authentic texture found in real animal fur. This suggests that the textures may include artificial patterns rather than natural ones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the zebra's body consistent and free from any geometric distortions like warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B maintains a coherent body shape, with proportions appearing regular and unchanged. There is no visible evidence of distortion, such as warping or stretching, affecting its anatomy or altering its form. This is determined by comparing typical zebra anatomy based on world knowledge concerning its distinctive body structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relative position between the zebra and the background grassland remain unchanged and natural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra appears to be positioned within a highly stylized or abstract background that presents an artificial disconnection from the natural grassland environment visible in Image A. The background in Image B is altered, displaying darker tones and smooth surfaces lacking grassland texture, suggesting a change in how the zebra relates spatially and visually to its environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grass blades and the zebra's hooves detailed and free from any loss of sharpness or introduction of noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the grass appears to be replaced by a uniform, dark surface without visible blades, removing detail that results in loss of sharpness. Similarly, the hoof lacks the refined distinctness, and the distracting noise associated with the texture changes introduces a less natural presentation. This analysis is drawn by observing the edited features, which lack the detail and definition of natural elements observed in Image A.",
