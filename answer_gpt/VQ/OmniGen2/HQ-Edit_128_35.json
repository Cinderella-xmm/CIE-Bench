      "question": "Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter featured on the notebook cover maintains the essential characteristics of a vintage typewriter. The keyboard area shows a correct layout with well-spaced keys, which is typical of older, manual typewriters and does not display any visible distortions or missing parts. By analyzing the image design and comparing it to the general appearance of typewriters, the body appears rectangular and coherent, without any warped edges or structural inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Tales Untold' in Image B is clearly positioned above the typewriter and does not overlap or cover any functional parts of the typewriter, such as the keys or levers. The baseline of the text is horizontal and aligns consistently with the orientation of the notebook, ensuring that the design maintains aesthetic balance without interference with the typewriter design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays ink splatters on the notebook cover, characterized by irregular dispersion and varied sizes. They have soft edges, enhancing the artistic effect. Notably, these splatters do not obscure any critical components of the typewriter, such as the keys or the paper roll, allowing all elements to remain visible and functional within the design context.",

      "question": "Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a marbled design, which extends uniformly across the entire base of the notebook cover. There are no gaps or clipping visible, and the coloration is consistent with no abrupt color changes or shifts at the edges, providing a seamless and coherent design throughout the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather spine is depicted with a consistent texture featuring slight color variations typical of leather material. The embossed key icons are evenly spaced, exhibit precise shaping, and the shading suggests depth and three-dimensionality, ensuring that these elements enhance the notebook design with realistic detail.",
