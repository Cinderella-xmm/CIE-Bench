      "question": "Do the clothing materials on both individuals display natural fabric textures consistent with denim and woven southwestern textiles, without visible artifacts or inconsistent shading?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the individual on the right is wearing a jacket that resembles denim, and the individual on the left is wearing a jacket with southwestern design elements. The textures appear to be consistent with these materials, as they have a natural appearance without artifacts or unusual shading. Denim typically has a woven texture, and southwestern textiles often have intricate patterns. The visual cues in Image B align with this expectation.",
