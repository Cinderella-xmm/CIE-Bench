      "question": "Does the checkmark pathway appear naturally tangled without breaking its geometric integrity or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the checkmark pathway is a crucial graphical element that needs to maintain its geometric integrity for visual coherence. 'Naturally tangled' refers to maintaining the pathway's path without any breakage or disrupting its flow and visual essence. Evaluating Image B reveals the checkmark retains a clean, smooth curve without unnatural artifacts disrupting its continuity or structural integrity.",

      "question": "Are the overlapping stamps on the 'We verify your Document' icon visually coherent and free from unnatural textures or excessive clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the first step's icon has additional overlapping elements like stamps. For it to be visually coherent, the icon should not have clutter that detracts from its design or introduces unwanted visual noise. Observing Image B shows that while the overlapping icon details are complex, they do not introduce excessive clutter or unnatural textures, keeping the design relatively coherent.",

      "question": "Does the red tape motif blend naturally into the orange circular step markers without causing visual disruption or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a red tape motif must integrate seamlessly with the rest of the design, especially the orange circular markers. A natural blend means the tape does not obscure or clash with existing details. Examining Image B shows that the tape appears as a distinct separate element around or near the markers rather than blending naturally with them, causing some disruption.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the icons and text within the orange circular step markers still legible and structurally consistent after the addition of the red tape motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text and icons within the step markers must retain legibility and structural consistency, even with any new motifs. Evaluating Image B shows the additions have caused certain texts like 'We verify your Compent' and 'Weriect yours Document' to be altered, impacting their legibility and consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the infographic maintained its clarity and sharpness without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Infographic clarity and sharpness are key for readability and aesthetic appeal. In Image B, visual elements need to retain their detail without being marred by artifacts or muddiness. Reviewing Image B indicates that several edits led to an overall reduction in textual clarity and introduced visual inconsistencies and text alterations, affecting overall sharpness.",
