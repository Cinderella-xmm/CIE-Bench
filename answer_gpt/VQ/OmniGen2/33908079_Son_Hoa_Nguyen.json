      "question": "Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the figure depicted are consistent with human anatomy. They feature five fingers, visible joints, and do not appear distorted or unnaturally shaped, which aligns with typical hand anatomy. The hands are shown holding tea leaves, and their proportions relative to the rest of the body do not suggest an unnatural size or shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green tones in the tea field vibrant yet consistent with natural plant colors, showing smooth gradients without abrupt shifts or artificial-looking patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cartoon-style tea field with vibrant green tones that are enhanced for artistic effect yet convey a sense of natural plant colors. There are smooth gradients present in the depiction of hills and rows, without noticeable abrupt shifts or artificial patches. The colors align with stylized representations found in illustrations but maintain resemblance to natural greenery.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the gold foil effect on the sack’s logo appear as a smooth, reflective metallic layer without jagged edges, unnatural glare, or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sack features a logo with a clearly depicted gold-colored emblem. However, it lacks the specific attributes of a metallic foil effect; it presents a flat color typical in illustrations without realistic features like reflective surfaces or lighting effects seen in foil. Therefore, it does not resemble a smooth metallic layer.",

      "question": "Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have vine-patterned borders along the edges of the image. The entirety of the artwork doesn't show any borders or decorative elements around the edges that resemble vine patterns or leaf structures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustration is presented as a clear, digitally rendered piece without a recycled paper texture overlay. The details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, and tea leaves are illustrated meticulously, and there is no texture applied that obscures these fine details.",
