      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the golden threads on the moon evenly distributed and seamlessly integrated into the circular shape without visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted with a consistent, circular shape, which suggests a seamless integration of golden threads. The artistic choice of golden threads suggests attention to detail, ensuring an even distribution and no visible breaks, as this would be crucial for maintaining the moon's integrity and artistic appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the interlocking geometric shapes on the mountain peaks align properly with the original ridge lines and maintain consistent scale and depth without floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are illustrated with geometric shapes that suggest a deliberate alignment with the natural ridge lines. The consistent scale and depth in Image B imply a careful construction that avoids any floating or disconnected segments, preserving the mountain's cohesive appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the embroidery patterns on the red trees aligned with their original positions and shapes, and do they display consistent thread density and direction without visible flaws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red trees in Image B are designed with detailed embroidery, which maintains alignment with their original positions. The consistency of thread density and direction suggests meticulous crafting, allowing for an even embroidery pattern without visible flaws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the silvery-blue silk strands follow the natural curvature of the water body and show smooth transitions between sections without abrupt changes in thickness or direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water is represented with silvery-blue silk strands. These strands appear to follow the water body's natural curvature, and the transitions between sections are smooth, maintaining the imaginary flow without abrupt changes in thickness or direction, which would otherwise disrupt the harmony of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water all share a consistent artistic style and lighting response without creating visual dissonance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the elements—golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water—exhibit a unified artistic style. The consistent use of textile-like aesthetics provides cohesion and matches in lighting and color palette, ensuring no visual dissonance emerges within the composition.",
