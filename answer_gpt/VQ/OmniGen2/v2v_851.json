      "question": "Are the textures and details of the horse and people preserved naturally without any unnatural artifacts after the monochrome conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), which features a monochrome and stylized presentation of event details, the focus is not on a realistic depiction of textures as is common in portrait photos. Instead, the design uses bold typography and iconography without directly representing details like the texture of horse fur or the people's clothing. Therefore, this question might not directly apply to Image B. However, within its style and focus, there aren’t any prominent unnatural artifacts present. The event flyer layout intentionally uses abstract, block-like text and images, typical in promotional materials rather than photo-realistic textures.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and shapes of the horse and people look realistic and undistorted in the monochrome rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the design focuses on typography and basic iconography while displaying event details, rather than depicting humans or animals in realistic forms. There are no human or horse shapes to assess in terms of realism and proportions. The design format is typically abstract, suggesting that literal shapes aren't the focus.",

      "question": "Do the background elements such as trees and the trailer retain their natural appearance and details without any loss or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include background elements such as trees or trailers, focusing instead on a stylized graphic representation. The design is primarily composed of bold text and symbols. Therefore, considering the lack of any detailed background elements aiming for naturalism in this image, any judgment about their natural appearance doesn’t apply.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the people and the horse appear natural and coherent without any visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no depiction of the interaction between people and horses in Image B. The typographic presentation on an event flyer doesn’t involve any characters or animals interacting. Thus, no visual inconsistencies are notable as the design’s purpose is to convey event information through text and symbolic representation rather than realistic scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the rustic typography used for event details blend naturally with the image without disrupting its overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image utilizes a bold and rustic typography style that fits the thematic intention of the event flyer (Image B). This style is purposefully implemented across various elements, and it aligns with the promotional and thematic requirements, which seek attention rather than mimicking a natural scene. The design is consistent within its artistic scope, not aiming for realism but instead focusing on visual impact.",
