    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laboratory background in Panel 1 is illustrated and consists of a diagram showing parts of a device rather than a realistic background. As it is a drawing, it doesn't focus on realistic lighting or depth alignment. The illustration is straightforward and serves as an educational diagram, and there are no visual cues to suggest floating or disconnected elements within its context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vape device is part of an illustrated diagram rather than held in a hand, so there is no analysis needed for finger alignment around a device. The device is depicted straight in the diagram with labels on its parts.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vape device in Panel 1 is part of an illustrative diagram meant for educational purposes. It does show the intended parts and labels clearly. Being a drawn image, it doesn't show natural reflections but represents the glass transparency clearly with a clean illustration style, meaning there is no issue with pixelation or unnatural highlights.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the internal structure of the vape device is illustrated with a focus on showing the components clearly. The parts are labeled and appear to be in a logical arrangement, such as the coil and airflow path structured in a feasible manner without broken lines or impossible geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text bubbles and labels in the illustration panels are positioned in a clear manner without overlapping important elements of the device or any clothing features. They are well-aligned for reading from top to bottom and left to right where applicable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vape device is part of an illustrative diagram and is not held by a hand, so there is no hand or fingers to analyze in terms of natural joint bends or deformities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clean boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, with no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration panels are separate from any photographic figure as Panel 1 and Panel 2 are simply illustrative diagrams. There are no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches, as the panels are meant to be standalone images explaining the device mechanics.",
