    "Question": "Q1: Does the anime-style conversion of the athlete retain the original pose structure without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete retains the same crouching pose as in Image A, which involves bending the knees and positioning the arms in a way typical for preparation in tennis. The limbs and body are proportioned correctly, showing no signs of distortion that would deviate from natural human anatomy. The conversion to an anime style involves a more stylized color palette and outlines but does not alter the underlying structure of the pose.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the enhanced facial expressions (focused eyes and light effects) integrated seamlessly into the athlete's face and do not appear as unnatural overlays?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is designed in an anime style with vibrant colors and effects, typical for conveying emotion and intensity. The addition of light effects and possibly more pronounced eye details are characteristic of this style and generally blend in with the overall animation.
