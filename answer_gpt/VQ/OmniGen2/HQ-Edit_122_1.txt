    "Question": "Q1: Do the petal-like wing structures appear translucent with smooth gradients and no jagged edges or unnatural pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wing structures appear smooth and seamless, as well as being translucent. There is a gradient that transitions smoothly across the wings, without any pixelation or jagged edges disturbing the appearance. The smooth transition of colors and the lack of harsh edges suggest a high-quality rendering typical in fantasy illustrations, confirming that the structure lacks unnatural pixelation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the sapphire orb eyes symmetrically positioned and emitting a soft glow without bleeding into the head or causing halo artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The sapphire orb eyes exhibit symmetry and are well-positioned on the butterfly's head in Image B. They emit a soft glow that is contained within the eyes themselves, without extending or bleeding into the head area or causing any halo artifacts. This indicates precise rendering techniques and careful attention to detail in maintaining the glow effect within bounds.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the starry trail aligned with the butterfly’s position and orientation, with gradual fading and no abrupt edges or floating particles?",
    "explanation": "The starry trail in Image B is aligned in coherence with the position and orientation of the figure, with a gradual fading effect. There are no abrupt edges or disjointed particles evident, ensuring a smooth transition along the trail. This suggests a carefully managed placement of elements to maintain consistency with the figure's motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the floating blooms positioned at plausible distances from the ground and integrated with the lighting gradient without casting inconsistent shadows?",
    "explanation": "The floating blooms in Image B are positioned at reasonable distances above the ground, contributing to the magical atmosphere. They are integrated seamlessly with the lighting gradient, ensuring they cast consistent shadows that align with the surrounding environment. This creates an overall harmonious appearance, supporting their integration within the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
