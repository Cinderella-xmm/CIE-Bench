      "question": "Does the glass display case appear transparent and free of unnatural textures or distortions that would make it look artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is shown to have a clear, reflective surface that resembles typical museum displays. With no signs of distortions like warping or pixelation, the glass maintains a transparent quality. The reflections and the way the light interacts with the glass are consistent with the characteristics of real glass, suggesting a natural and convincing representation.",

      "question": "Is the light focused on the dogâ€™s face well-integrated with the environment, without introducing noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is focused within the display case, specifically illuminating the dog's face and the upper part of its body in a way that highlights details effectively. The lighting appears well-distributed, creating a soft illumination that doesn't produce stark shadows or overly bright highlights. This integration suggests a careful balance that maintains the ambient lighting of a display setting.",

      "question": "Does the dog remain proportionally consistent within the new museum exhibit setup, avoiding any distortion or deformation in its physical structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is displayed within a glass case, and its appearance is consistent with realistic proportions. The head and body are sculpted with anatomical accuracy and do not exhibit signs of distortion or deformation that would suggest an artificial alteration of its structure. The character of the dog remains intact, maintaining both size and shape appropriateness within the context of the display case.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The informational label in Image B has a clear and smooth appearance, adhering well to the surface it is placed on. The text is aligned and sharply defined without visible signs of jagged edges or disruptions that would indicate hasty editing. The positioning seems intentional and harmonious with the overall display, suggesting professional handling of such informational elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the dog, such as fur texture and facial expression, maintained with clarity and authenticity, without becoming overly smoothed or pixelated?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is displayed as a detailed sculpture. The surface exhibits realistic textures and fine detailing that captures the essence of the fur and facial expression. These elements are preserved with high clarity, and there is no evidence of pixelation or overly smooth textures that would detract from the authenticity of the depiction. This suggests a high level of detail and care in maintaining the original characteristics of the dog.",
