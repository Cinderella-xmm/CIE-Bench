    "Question": "Q3: Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
    "explanation": "Image B doesn't depict seamless color transitions from black to caramel because the piano is entirely in a caramel color suggesting a candy-like design, unlike the black color seen in Image A. The lighting does interact naturally, but there is no transition from black to caramel in this design.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the piano and its decorative details are sharp and clean, illustrating clearly defined boundaries without pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending. The quality suggests high-resolution rendering appropriate for designed imagery.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows on the marble tabletop are consistent with the direction of light that also appears in the image. The shadows are soft and naturally diffused, reflecting the light setup akin to the room scene, demonstrating consistent light behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"
