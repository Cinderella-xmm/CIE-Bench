    "Question": "Q1: Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic widgets and 3D elements seem suspended above the screen, rather than integrated into the phone's surface. They create a sense of floating which may cause them to not align perfectly with the device’s actual geometry or depth cues. Since they do not appear to be part of the phone's flat display, they don't maintain consistent depth cues and shadowing that align with the phone’s form factor.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the forward-projection effect looks coherent without visible distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges. The holographic projection maintains a spatial relationship with the hand, as the hand's position and grasp seem logical and there's harmony between the screen projection and the position of the hand. Thus, visually the elements relate properly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict any biometric hand scanning overlay, but assuming it had one, it should align directly with the hand anatomy. The hand appears with appropriate finger positions without distortion or additional fingers, maintaining proportions aligned with natural human anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skyline is rendered well with consistent geometry and perspective. It fits within the boundaries of the laptop screen and aligns with the bezel and keyboard naturally. There is no observable clipping or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the smartphone and laptop displays exhibit a consistent visual design with a blue color palette and futuristic typography. The holographic style shares similarities on both devices, contributing to a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
