      "question": "Do the swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower maintain consistent geometric continuity without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling cloud-like structures are observed surrounding the tower in a fluid and continuous manner. They feature smooth curves and lack jagged or broken edges, contributing to an overall cohesive and harmonious aesthetic. The soft and rounded forms are typical of cloud structures and align with common design principles of fluidity and continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent runes aligned with the wood grain and carving details, and do they emit light without creating unnatural halos or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent runes on the tower in Image B appear to be neatly aligned along the wood surfaces, suggesting integration with the existing architectural details. The runes emit a soft glow with clean edges, avoiding unnatural halos or pixelation, which indicates a thoughtful design catering to realism and digital clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shimmering crystal spires reflect light naturally, showing subtle variations in transparency and surface highlights consistent with real crystal under daylight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays crystal spires at the top of the tower that exhibit surface highlights and varying transparency, elements typical of real crystal under illumination. The reflections and light dispersion mimic the natural behavior of crystals, highlighting the detail and realism embedded in the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing celestial orbs centered and securely attached to the tips of the spires, maintaining proportional scale and alignment with the architectural axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial orbs are distinctly placed at the tips of the spires, with a focus on symmetry and alignment with the building's geometric axis. This centering and proportionality reflect consistent design choices that preserve architectural balance and visual harmony.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the silver spiral trees maintain three-dimensional volume and proper shadowing, appearing solid rather than transparent or two-dimensional?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the silver spiral trees in the scene maintain a three-dimensional appearance due to the careful incorporation of shadowing and volume. They present solidity which enhances their realism, as opposed to appearing flat or transparent, illustrating effective use of shading and depth in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ghostly bird apparitions semi-transparent with smooth feather outlines and consistent motion direction, without fragmented or duplicated body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ghostly bird apparitions in Image B are depicted as semi-transparent with smooth feather outlines that enhance their ethereal quality. They show consistent motion direction, and there is no evidence of fragmentation or duplication, suggesting careful attention to detail in their rendering process.",
