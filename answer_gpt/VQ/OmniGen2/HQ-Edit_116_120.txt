    "Question": "Q1: Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical glass dome appears clear, smooth, and without evident seams or distortions which could interfere with the view of the sandcastle inside. The light refraction is consistent, allowing a clear and undistorted view of the sandcastle. Common visual cues suggest a high-quality transparent glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
    "explanation": "The mahogany base in Image B shows a natural wood texture and appears uniformly thick. Its scale relative to the glass dome and sandcastle seems appropriate, as there is no distortion, and it supports the structure effectively given common proportions for display bases.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the sand appears smooth and with a believable sand-like texture. The absence of overpowering glitter ensures that the sandcastle's features are not obscured, allowing clear visibility of fine details like the stairs and towers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seashells positioned around the sandcastle are distinct and well-defined, appear to be at a proper scale relative to the sandcastle, and show no signs of pixelation or odd artifacts. The clarity reflects quality image editing or rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
    "explanation": "The ceramic plaque in Image B can be read easily, displaying the text ‘Empire of the Shores’ with clarity. It appears well integrated with the base, with a consistent matte finish that shows no mismatch with the surrounding materials or excessive glare.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle and shells show a consistent matte appearance with no visible shine or reflection, which would be typical for a uniformly applied matte pearl finish. This maintains visual coherence and supports the aesthetic choice of a subdued surface texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
    "explanation": "The architectural features of the sandcastle in Image B, including towers, stairs, and arches, are complete and geometrically consistent. There is no sign of deformation or missing elements, indicating a careful and correct representation of architectural integrity, typical for precise model or image rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
