      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The burgundy drapes in Image B are designed to hang down with elegant folds that appear smooth, which is typical of heavy fabric hanging naturally. The shadow gradients align well with realistic lighting assumptions, showing a gradual transition from light to dark that enhances the perception of depth in the drapery. The presence of shadows on the adjacent wall and floor that correspond to the position and fall of drapes further supports the natural look and realistic lighting in the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold woodwork details on the bed frame continuous, symmetrical, and free from warped or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold woodwork in Image B appears well-crafted and follows a consistent pattern that is both continuous and symmetrical, typical of luxurious bed frames. The design shows clean lines and well-defined geometric shapes without any distortions or interruptions, suggesting high-quality craftsmanship. These features are consistent with common characteristics of ornate furniture.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cherub images on the pillows show visible brushstroke texture, subtle color gradients, and seamless integration into the pillow surface without sharp borders or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pillows in Image B do not feature cherub images. Instead, they have floral designs that appear well-integrated into the surface with no visible brushstroke texture or signs of pixelation. The colors are smoothly transitioned without harsh borders, indicating a thoughtful design process aimed at providing a realistic fabric appearance consistent with high-quality prints.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are consistent with the lighting source direction, likely from the ceiling area, and follow a logical pattern across both walls and floor surfaces. The way the shadows fall and the angles at which they spread indicate an understanding of how light interacts with structures, supporting the claims of realistic lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the redesigned canopy bed is well-positioned within the room's confines. The bed doesnâ€™t exceed the ceiling height or wrongly overlap with the walls, which preserves the spatial organization. Moreover, the proportions and scale of the bed are in harmony with nearby furniture such as the nightstand and rug, which is crucial for maintaining an authentic room setup.",
