      "question": "Does the glass bottle form retain the original carâ€™s side profile and curvature without visible warping or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bottle exhibits a smooth and symmetrical curvature typical of finely crafted containers. Common knowledge tells us that such bottles are designed to have uniform proportions and smooth lines to enhance aesthetic appeal. Without visual cues indicating disproportionate scaling or warping, it appears orderly and proportionate, maintaining an elegant design that could draw inspiration from automotive aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass stoppers aligned with the original headlight positions and do they show consistent lighting and reflection patterns with the surrounding glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features faceted glass stoppers where they could theoretically align with headlight positions if modeled after an automobile. These stoppers exhibit consistent lighting reflections, characteristic of high-quality glass that reflects light uniformly due to smooth surfaces. Without known misalignment patterns relative to any specified origin, the design maintains coherence in its presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gear-shaped lid positioned centrally on the roof and securely connected to the glass body without visible seams or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gear-shaped lid of the bottle is positioned centrally, adhering directly to the top with no visible seams or edges, suggesting a unified design approach. Secure attachment is typical of high-quality construction to prevent any separation or aesthetic inconsistency, commonly understood through finely crafted items' standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed Datsun emblem clearly visible on the front of the glass bottle and does it maintain proper depth and clarity without surface distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible Datsun emblem present on the bottle. Instead, the bottle has different detailing and branding, typically involving the name and design elements with no indication of warping or distortion, ensuring visual clarity and maintaining a polished embossed effect. Given the absence, this suggests that the bottle is entirely original in branding without using automotive emblems.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the glass body display natural reflections and highlights across its surface without abrupt transitions or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays smooth and natural highlights on the glass body. It shows a fluid transition between reflections, typical of refined glassware designed to enhance visual appeal. This kind of finish is widely recognized in premium glass products, indicating manufacturing quality without any abrupt or artificial-looking transitions across the surface.",
