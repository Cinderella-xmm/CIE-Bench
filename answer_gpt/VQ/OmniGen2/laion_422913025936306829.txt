    "Question": "Q1: Are the color blocks applied across the shirtâ€™s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt features bright, neon colors with distinct, bold lines that create clearly separated sections or blocks of color. The colors are sharply defined, with no visible blending or smudging; each color segment stands out distinctly against the others, contributing to a visually dynamic, almost comic-book style. This sharp definition is integrated with thick black outlines reinforcing the separation between the blocks, indicative of intentional design focusing on clarity and contrast.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a vibrant, non-repeating pattern that does not exhibit symmetry across the shirt. Instead, the design comprises irregular, abstract, and dynamic lines that create a unique pattern concentrated primarily on the chest and partially into the arms of the shirt. The differences in color and pattern between Image A and Image B suggest a complete redesign rather than an effort to preserve original symmetry or layout.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of limbs and torso adopts an exaggerated, muscular form reminiscent of superhero comics, where proportions emphasize musculature and stylization rather than realistic anatomy. The joint lines are smooth and maintain a credible flow, despite being artistically stylized. The figure's build is consistent with artistic conventions that favor exaggerated proportions for dramatic effect rather than strict adherence to realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design prioritizes bold color and line over intricate detail. While some general outlines and features may be identifiable, the emphasis on boldness results in less focus on fine details such as intricate facial features or delicate hair texture. The thick lines and vivid colors overshadow the presence of detailed ornamentation that would commonly be observed in designs focusing heavily on intricate details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure does not utilize a circular frame as in Image A. Instead, the design appears freeform with vivid, abstract color patterns radiating across the shirt's entirety. While the dynamic color pattern commands immediate attention, it lacks the clear geometric framing seen in traditional designs, and instead favors an expressive, unrestricted arrangement. Thus, there is no specific circular frame or bordered shapes present for alignment consideration.",
    "answer": "No"
