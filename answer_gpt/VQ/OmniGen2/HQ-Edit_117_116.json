    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wings display a smooth, translucent gradient resembling flowing water without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the dragonfly exhibit a gradient with smooth and continuous transitions, mimicking the appearance of flowing water. The colors blend without any visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural banding. This observation is based on the uninterrupted flow of colors from one edge to another across the wings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scales on the dragonfly’s body evenly distributed, aligned with its natural segmentation, and do they exhibit smooth color transitions without abrupt edges or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scales on the dragonfly's body are symmetrically aligned with its natural segmentation, maintaining a consistent design. The colors transition smoothly across the body, avoiding abrupt changes or repetitive patterns, ensuring the dragonfly retains an organic look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their spherical shape and contain layered, dark blue internal structures that suggest depth, without appearing flattened or unnaturally textured?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragonfly's eyes in Image B are spherical, with internal structures that provide a sense of depth. The use of layered dark blue shades gives the eyes dimension, preventing them from appearing flat or textured unnaturally. This contributes to the realistic depiction of the dragonfly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the aquatic vines wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs in a continuous, non-intersecting manner, with a soft glowing edge that does not bleed into surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aquatic vines are visually wrapped around the dragonfly's legs, maintaining a continuous and non-intersecting arrangement. The edges of these vines glow softly but are distinct without bleeding into the surrounding areas, preserving clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist evenly diffused around the dragonfly, fading gradually into the air without sharp edges, clumping, or unnatural brightness spikes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mist that envelops the dragonfly with even diffusion. It fades gradually into the air, leaving no sharp edges, clumping, or unexpected brightness spikes that would detract from the natural feel of the environment, indicating careful attention to detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the water accurately depict the edited dragonfly’s features, including wings, body patterns, and vines, with appropriate distortion and reduced brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in the water in Image B captures the dragonfly's features, including its wings, body patterns, and vines. It shows appropriate distortion due to the water's surface without excessive brightness, reflecting the dragonfly accurately as expected of a natural scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
