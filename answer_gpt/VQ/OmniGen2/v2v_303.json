      "question": "Does the wavy background maintain its vibrant colors and fluid patterns without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of colorful wavy lines that are vibrant and fluid. There are no visible distortions or artifacts that detract from the aesthetic of the image. The design remains consistent with the neon-like style, suggesting that the editing has preserved the intended effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the coat and scarf detailed and natural, avoiding any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coat and scarf in Image B appear to have been rendered in a 3D style. While the textures may differ from those of a natural fabric, they are consistent with the stylized, three-dimensional aesthetic and appear smooth and detailed within this context. The editing aims to simulate a 3D look, which it achieves without introducing unnatural artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the 3D-rendered elements and the original image components smooth, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to be entirely rendered in a 3D style. Given that all elements conform to this style, there are no visible transitions between 3D-rendered elements and non-3D elementsâ€”suggesting a coherent integration across the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical properties of the subject's face and body appear realistic and consistent with human anatomy, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B is a 3D stylization, the proportions and anatomy are structured in a realistic manner typical of high-quality 3D character models. The body posture and clothing fit appear natural even within the stylized 3D rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the image visually credible, without any distracting or unnatural elements introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B is visually cohesive, maintaining a consistent style throughout. The colors, lighting, and arrangement do not introduce any distractions or unnatural elements. The image retains a harmonious balance typical of artistic 3D renderings.",
