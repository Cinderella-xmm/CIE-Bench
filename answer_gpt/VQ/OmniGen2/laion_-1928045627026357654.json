    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the male's shirt display a consistent 3D plush texture with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural shading that breaks the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt appears to have a smooth texture representing a stylized appearance typical of a cartoon or chibi design. The material seems consistent with the rest of the plastic-like appearance, without pixelation or rough edges common to digital artifacts. This smoothness and consistency align with plush textures seen in stylized digital art. Therefore, the shirt does appear consistent, avoiding any signs of pixelation or unnatural shading.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the collar of the male's shirt proportionally enlarged without distorting the neck or shoulder line, and does it maintain smooth contours without sharp or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collar seems proportionate and fits the chibi figure design style without visible distortion of neck or shoulder lines. The contours are smooth and match the simplified, rounded design typical for figures like this, avoiding sharp edges. This design maintains the proportions and avoids distortion common in transitions between real-life and stylized representations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the pleats on the female's pants symmetrically arranged and physically plausible, without floating or overlapping layers that defy gravity or fabric tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pleats of the pants simplified to fit the chibi design, which often uses minimal detail for maximal stylistic effect. The pleats do appear symmetrical relative to the chibi format and maintain a plausible form for this type of character representation, avoiding any visual elements that defy gravity or realistic cloth behavior.",

      "question": "Does the enlarged sleeve on the female’s top extend naturally from the shoulder without distorting her arm or causing unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sleeves in Image B match the chibi design, with the arm extended smoothly from the shoulder and styled without awkward gaps or overlaps. Typical chibi character design allows for minimalistic and exaggerated features, yet the sleeve maintains a consistent and smooth transition to the arm that is visually pleasing and logically follows the figure’s anatomy within this art style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters evenly lit and proportionally scaled, with no abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stage beneath the characters is designed with pastel colors that evenly blend into each other, without shadow inconsistencies or abrupt color shifts. The bright, clear coloring supports the cartoonish aesthetic and seems proportionate for the characters, enhancing the stylized presentation and avoiding any signs of poor integration.",
