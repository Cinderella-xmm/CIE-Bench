      "question": "Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a graphic representation of a tiger's face, where the edges are crafted to appear smooth and uniformly thick, suggestive of a digital illustration or vector artwork. The uniformity and clean lines demonstrate high-quality graphic design, as opposed to pixelation or broken lines, which indicate poor rendering. This conclusion is drawn from observing the smooth curvature and consistent thickness of lines outlining the tiger's facial features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's stripes and whiskers are part of a stylized design that focuses on symmetry and balance. The facial structure shows a deliberate symmetry across the vertical axis, with the stripes and whiskers mirroring each other on both sides of the face. This proportional consistency is a hallmark of intentional artistic design. Therefore, the symmetry and proportion are visually maintained throughout the tiger's face.",

      "question": "Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's kimono design features clear delineation between visually distinct layers, which are indicated by clean, defined edges. This kind of precision in layer separation implies a careful and considered design approach, common in vector graphics or meticulously designed illustrations. The absence of overlapping or floating segments further suggests proper layering, ensuring a cohesive and structured appearance.",

      "question": "Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold foil elements in Image B are designed to seamlessly integrate with the floral pattern. They exhibit a consistent reflectivity that doesn't clash with the surrounding design. The absence of harsh highlights or unrelated floating fragments suggests the gold elements are purposefully integrated, contributing to a unified design aesthetic typical of well-executed graphic artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garment design, including any detachable panels, adheres to a logical arrangement where components align with anticipated fold lines and seams. This is deduced from the seamless attachment and logical positioning in relation to the natural structure of kimonos. The secure connection, along with the absence of floating or improperly intersecting segments, is indicative of a thoughtful and coherent design.",
