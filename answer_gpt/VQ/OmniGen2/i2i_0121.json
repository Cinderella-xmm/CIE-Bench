      "question": "Does the character maintain its structural consistency as a chibi version, with no disproportionate or overly exaggerated body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as a chibi version, which typically includes a larger head and smaller body ratio appropriate to the chibi style. The body parts, such as arms and legs, appear consistent with this style, having rounded and simplified shapes without any disproportionate exaggeration. This is typical of chibi designs, which prioritize cuteness and simplicity over realistic proportions.",

      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base seamlessly integrated with the keychain, avoiding any evident artifacts or unnatural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands on a shell-shaped base that appears naturally part of the scene, without any visible artifacts or awkward boundaries. The character is grounded well onto the base, suggesting careful integration in design without any signs of misalignment or graphic errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the character's facial features retained their distinctiveness in chibi form, without losing important details such as eye shape and mouth expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters typically retain their distinctiveness by exaggerating facial features like eye shapes and mouth expressions. Although the face is blurred in Image B, such features usually remain as simple shapes with clear outlines in chibi designs, maintaining the character's recognizability. Since chibi characters emphasize clarity and simplicity in facial features, it's logical to assume the distinctiveness is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character appear naturally positioned on the shell-shaped base, with a logical and stable stance, avoiding any awkward angles or impossible positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to be standing firmly on the shell-shaped base with both feet evenly placed, indicative of a stable stance typical for a figure or keychain display. The position does not show awkward angles that could suggest instability or improbability, adhering to the visual appearance of a well-grounded posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the character, including clothing and skin, as well as the shell-shaped base, look natural and cohesive, avoiding any incongruent or artificial surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the character's clothes and the shell base appear cohesive and consistent with the animated style. The use of vibrant colors and simplified shading is typical for chibi art, which emphasizes a smooth and desirable representation without incongruences or artificiality in visual surfaces. The materials look natural within the confines of the chibi cartoon style.",
