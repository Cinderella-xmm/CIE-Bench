    "Question": "Q1: Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The image shows a sculpture composed of puzzle-like pieces. The beige and brown pieces are closely interlocked and aligned, filling the space without visible gaps or irregularities. The interlocking mechanism appears seamless, which is typical for well-designed puzzle constructions, indicating thorough alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
    "explanation": "The edges of the puzzle pieces in the sculpture exhibit smooth and continuous lines that fit well with the curved shape of the object. There are no sudden changes in direction or flat areas that would suggest distortion. This alignment supports the original shape maintaining its three-dimensional form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
    "explanation": "The green puzzle piece appears uniform in color and texture, consistent with the material and finish of the surrounding puzzle pieces. There are no visible irregularities like cracks or mismatched color patches, which ensures a seamless visual continuity with adjacent pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture is positioned horizontally on the shelf, with its base making stable contact with the surface. The object casts a natural shadow beneath it, which suggests proper alignment and stability, avoiding any appearance of imbalance or tilting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The facial features of the sculpture, including eyes, eyebrows, and mouth, are clearly defined and proportional. Despite the puzzle piece design, these elements retain their shape, suggesting skilled integration that avoids blurring or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
