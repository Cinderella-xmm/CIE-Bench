      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is transparent and appears smooth in its coverage over the scene. The underlying elements such as the house, tree, and ground are visibly clear and undistorted within the dome, indicating that the dome covers the scene without affecting the clarity or appearance of these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy green pathways are depicted as a smooth grassy area surrounding the lake. The pathways blend seamlessly with the terrain level and match the surrounding ground texture, which contributes to a coherent landscape appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size and texture of the added shrubs are consistent with the other trees in the scene. The shrubs appear natural and proportionate in relation to the existing plants, enhancing the overall harmony of the scene's flora.",

      "question": "Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lake as being integrated into the landscape with clearly defined edges. It has a reflective surface that logically interacts with the surrounding elements like the bridge and foliage, giving a realistic effect that is consistent with how water generally appears in such configurations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy lights are strategically placed around the area of the lake, and while they do glow softly, they do not appear to be wrapped around the tree branches. Thus, the placement does emit a soft glow without harsh highlights, but they are not following the branches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bridge span the lake with stable supports and connect directly to the ground on both sides without floating or tilting?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge in Image B is shown spanning the lake with stable supports that connect directly to the ground on both sides. It appears to be firmly positioned with no signs of floating or instability, providing a realistic depiction of a bridge structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) rendered with materials and lighting that match the rustic, natural aesthetic of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the new elements such as the dome, lake, bridge, and lights are designed with a more polished and artificial aesthetic compared to the rustic look of the original scene in Image A. While they are integrated well in terms of design, they contrast with the original's more natural texture and theme.",
