    "Question": "Q1: Does the packaging box maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor, especially in alignment with the base and handle, without any distorted edges or warped geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box sits underneath the food processor attachment and is used as a stand for it. The box size and positioning need to be accurate to serve this purpose convincingly. Visually, the box aligns well with the food processor attachment, indicating no warped geometry or disproportionate aspects. The edges of the box appear straight and consistent, maintaining visual coherence with the product on it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the 'Waring' brand name clearly visible and properly aligned on the packaging without overlapping or distorting adjacent elements such as the appliance illustration or background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Waring' logo is prominently displayed on the front of the box. Its placement below the isometric drawing does not overlap or interfere with other design elements on the box. The alignment appears centered and clearly visible, maintaining separation from adjacent illustrations and text, which suggests careful design consideration and application.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the isometric illustration of the food processor on the box accurately reflect the original object's geometry, including the feed tube, lid, and base, without distortion or incorrect angles?",
    "explanation": "Examining the isometric illustration on the box in Image B, the depiction of the food processor components such as the feed tube, lid, and base appears faithful to their design in terms of proportions and angles. The illustration is simplified yet precisely mimics the structure without evident distortion or incorrect geometry, reflecting the real product.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the exploded components of the food processor depicted with accurate shapes and positions, maintaining their original form and material texture without stretching or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the exploded components on the packaging box are illustrated with clear delineation of their shapes and positions relative to the assembly process. These components maintain their form and do not show signs of distortion or loss of detail, ensuring they accurately represent the original parts. The illustrations exhibit clarity and maintain material interpretation without any stretching or blurring effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging display natural material finishes without unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging's portrayal of metallic silver and matte black surfaces appears well-executed, showing natural finishes that correspond to the expected material textures. The metallic surfaces on the box have a subtle sheen that mimics realistic reflections. Additionally, the matte black portions do not exhibit graininess or texture artifacts, ensuring a faithful representation of the product's material finishes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
