      "question": "Do the extended page edges blend naturally into the frame without introducing any unnatural breaks or abrupt transitions at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the extended pages seem to smoothly blend into the frame without any visible breaks or sharp corners, suggesting a consistent integration with the book's edges. The book's frame appears natural with curved edges, typically seen when a book is opened, indicating a seamless continuity. Therefore, based on the visual cues showing a smooth transition at the corners, the integration is visually consistent with what would naturally occur.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved shadow cast by the extended pages follow the lighting direction present in the original image, contributing to a natural perception of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is coming from the left side, casting a shadow primarily from the book's center to the right. The shadow appears consistent with the light source, matching the curved nature of the pages as they lift off the table. This creates a natural perception of depth, indicating adherence to the original image's lighting direction. Thus, the shadow is congruent with the lighting dynamics observed.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the extended pages consistent with the original pages, with no visible loss or distortion of the text and paper grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the extended pages maintain the texture and appearance of paper grain that is consistent with the original content, visible in the paper's fibers and the printed text. There is no apparent distortion or loss of detail; the text remains clear and readable, matching the original paper's texture. This consistency in texture and detail suggests the extensions maintain the visual characteristics of the book's original pages.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the curvature of the extended pages consistent with the perspective of the original image, creating a believable unfolding effect without distorting the geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The extended pages in Image B maintain a natural curve that corresponds with the bookâ€™s opened structure, consistent with the likely perspective and unfolding effect. The curvature reflects standard geometric expectations when a book is open, without introducing visual distortions. Comparing to Image A, both maintain the curved trajectory of the pages, suggesting the extension respects the original perspective without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the base of the book and the wooden table appear natural, with no unrealistic gaps or overlaps introduced by the extension of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the book in Image B seems to rest naturally on the wooden table surface without any gaps or overlaps that would appear unrealistic. The interaction between the book and the table surface continues to look seamless like in a normal scenario where a book lies flat on a surface. The pages lifting do not introduce any visual dissonance at their base, appearing congruent with the actual support seen in Image A.",
