      "question": "Does the gold banana appear naturally integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana is painted in a vibrant golden color with a smooth, shiny texture. The lighting and shadows on the banana match the overall lighting of the scene, which helps in integrating it into the image naturally. There are no visible seams or artifacts around the banana that suggest it was artificially inserted or that its color is unnatural within this surreal context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the liquefying textures applied to the blue figure natural, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue figure appears smooth and well-defined, consistent with a digitally painted style that maintains the surreal nature of the composition. The textures appear intentional, and the style, while abstract, does not exhibit any distracting artifacts or blurring that might indicate an unnatural alteration.",

      "question": "Does the fantastical background maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, without any broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background filled with various geometric shapes that are sharply delineated and arranged thoughtfully, adding to the surrealist theme. There are no broken shapes or inconsistent patterns observable; each object appears intentional and contributes to the overall structure and visual style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of elements in the surrealist-style painting maintain visual credibility and avoid any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B demonstrates a coherent arrangement where the combination of the blue figure, the golden banana, and geometric shapes includes a balanced and deliberate placement throughout the frame. The proportions and sizes are appropriate for the surrealist theme, with no obvious distortions that would disrupt the aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the banana retain its natural appearance, with the correct number of fingers, natural lines, and textures conforming to ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is depicted with an appropriate number of fingers and a grasp on the banana that appears natural in terms of position and grip. The lines and shading on the hand suggest form and depth consistent with a realistic representation, thus conforming to an ergonomic appearance.",
