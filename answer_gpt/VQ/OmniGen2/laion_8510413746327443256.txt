    "Question": "Q1: Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic dragon eye is observed as having a fluid and dynamic design with smooth gradient transitions between colors and a uniform lighting effect. There's no visible pixelation or jagged edges, suggesting a high-resolution display without any image artifacts such as unnatural glow. The visual representation demonstrates advanced rendering quality typically expected from futuristic smart devices.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "The band in Image B appears to be made of metallic scales, which are shown as consistently aligned and exhibit proper shading that conveys a sense of depth and texture associated with metal surfaces. There are no visible gaps or overlapping, maintaining geometric continuity. Typically, such precision in design indicates a high-quality render or well-crafted physical object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?",
    "explanation": "The glowing neural node on the side of the watch in Image B is visually coherent with the rest of the casing. Its illumination seems consistent and focused, without any signs of shape distortion or irregular light leakage. This suggests a well-integrated design, often achieved through sophisticated rendering techniques or meticulous physical manufacturing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?",
    "explanation": "The control sigils on the watch face in Image B appear distinct, with well-defined boundaries and a uniform glow that maintains a consistent brightness level. There is no evidence of blurring or ghosting, which indicates precise rendering quality typically seen in high-resolution displays or carefully designed UI elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, each component of the watch, including the case, band, crown, and side button, appears to be proportionally aligned and structurally coherent. There is no visible warping, stretching, or misplacement, which reflects a well-designed watch, aligning with expectations for both real-world manufacturing precision and high-quality digital rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
