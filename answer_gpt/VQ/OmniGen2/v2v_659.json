      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style mascot maintain the structural consistency of the original person's features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues seen in Image B, the 3D chibi-style mascot features a stylized representation that typically aims to maintain proportional integrity, as seen in the hair and royal crown. In the chibi art style, features are often exaggerated in a cute and stylized manner, but this should not create distortions that make the elements appear unnatural or inconsistent with the intended style. Observing the details in the hair and clothing, they seem congruent with normal chibi transformations, preserving the original elements without introducing glaring structural errors.",
