    "Question": "Q5: Are the fine details in the sunflower centers, hair braids, and facial features preserved and clearly defined, without noticeable blurring or artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the stylization emphasizes certain Art Nouveau elements, some fine details, such as the sunflower centers and hair braids, are adapted to the style's smooth and flowing aesthetics. This sometimes results in a more stylized representation rather than a focus on ultra-fine detail. However, the question about facial features does not apply directly since the face is intentionally blurred. Overall, for the aspects visible, the stylization may sacrifice some of the original fine detail clarity.",
    "answer": "No"
