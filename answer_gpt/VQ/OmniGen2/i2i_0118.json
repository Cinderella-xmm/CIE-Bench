        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character of Pikachu is depicted on what appears to be a tablet screen. The edges of the character are smooth and do not show any noticeable signs of pixelation or misalignment against the screen. The black border around the character effectively represents the tablet, suggesting it is an intentional frame rather than a discrepancy. There are no visible discrepancies or gaps between the character and the supposed screen surface that would disrupt the illusion of integration.",
