    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, represented by an eye, are placed near the handlebars on the red surface of the motorcycle. The integration appears smooth with no indication of seams or mismatches, likely due to the cartoonish style that naturally blends elements without detailed textures. The image accentuates simplicity and bold colors which aid in seamless integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the motorcycle with stylized wheels that feature cartoonish elements. The design maintains the geometric consistency of the wheels with no visible distortion to the rims or spokes. The cartoon limbs blend in without disturbing the structural form of the wheel, as typical in stylized illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines are drawn along the sides of the motorcycle to suggest movement. They are angled forward and positioned away from the core structural elements like the chain and branding. The “VOOM!!” seen does not intersect essential logos or components, aligning with a comic illustration style that prioritizes clear representation of both motion and branding.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the motorcycle with a cartoon hero suit design. Despite the stylized depiction, the fundamental tubular structure of the frame is retained with consistent dimensions. There are no evident bulges or deformation, as cartoons often exaggerate certain features without altering the basic shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
    "explanation": "The sound effect text 'VOOM!!' in Image B is placed to suggest movement, positioned above the motorcycle without interfering with the main structural components. It does not obscure key elements like the DUCATI branding or control levers, which is typical in illustrations where text elements are used to enhance dynamics without obstructing visibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
