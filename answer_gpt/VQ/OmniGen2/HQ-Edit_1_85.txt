    "Question": "Q1: Are the lace details on the blouse rendered with consistent texture and edge definition, avoiding jagged or artificial-looking patterns that break from realistic fabric behavior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse's lace details are simplified and stylized, with a clean, uniform pattern that aligns with the artistic style seen in vector graphics or digital illustrations. This approach typically removes the complexity of textures found in realistic depictions and instead focuses on uniformity and clear lines. As such, the lace does not appear jagged or artificial within the context of this style, as it adheres to a consistent pattern throughout the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the enlarged violin maintain correct proportions and undistorted structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, without visible warping or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is depicted in a stylized manner, consistent with the illustration style that simplifies and flattens features. The scroll, bridge, and f-holes are depicted clearly and within proportional context of the art style. Although there may be simplification in detail, the structural elements appear undistorted and are placed in a manner that maintains the recognizable form of a violin appropriate for the illustration's style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the fingers on both hands correctly positioned and shaped, with no extra digits or distorted joints, maintaining natural human anatomy?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are drawn in a stylized and simplified manner. The design ensures that the fingers do not have extra digits or overly distorted joints. While the anatomy is not depicted with realistic detail, the artistic representation keeps in line with fundamental anatomical structure, maintaining recognizability within the constraints of the style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the overall surface texture consistent across the image, with no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a flat, digital illustration style without realistic texturing. The colors and shading are consistent, with no sudden shifts or textures within the image. Each element has uniform coloring, aligning with the expected flatness and material consistency typical of this illustration technique, avoiding any mismatched areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all foreground elements (girl, violin, table, candlestick) maintain consistent depth and placement, avoiding floating or misplaced components that disrupt spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the table and candlestick are not present, the girl and violin are illustrated in a static, two-dimensional style where perspective is implied rather than explicitly depicted. All components are arranged without any indication of floating or misplacement, maintaining spatial logic in the context of this artistic style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
