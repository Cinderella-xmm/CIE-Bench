    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted using distinct geometric shapes, with clear straight lines and smooth angles, giving them a structured appearance. These geometric forms do not exhibit distorted edges or irregular facets, maintaining their structural integrity. This approach is in line with the art style that emphasizes clear and consistent geometrical representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of trees follows an abstract geometric style. The trees are depicted with clear and consistent shapes, composed of straight lines and sharp angles, without fragmented or misshapen branches. This aligns with the theme of using simplified geometric forms in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the parallel lines radiating from the sun into the river represent stylized reflections, aligning deliberately with the central axis of the image, giving an artistic interpretation of flow. These lines are spaced uniformly, contributing to visual continuity and symmetry typical of the geometric style prevalent in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the symmetrical placement of geometric shapes suggests a structured representation of reflections in the river. However, as per the analysis, while the river reflects the geometric influence overhead, it does not mirror exact positions as the river's lines create a distinct design element rather than a true reflection. This takes advantage of the geometric art style to emphasize bold, creative expression rather than precise symmetry.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boundaries of color blocks are distinctly clear, with no visible blurring or feathering, and the sharpness remains consistent throughout the image. This is typical of the geometric and vector art style, ensuring each color block is well-defined and contributes to the clean and organized appearance of the artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
