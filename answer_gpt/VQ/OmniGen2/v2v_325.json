      "question": "Do the chibi car mascots retain their original car shapes and colors without any noticeable distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars appear as stylized versions. They are brighter and have been modified in shape and size, resembling toys or mascots, which indicates a noticeable change from traditional car shapes and dimensions. This reflects a loss of detail and intentional distortion to fit the 'chibi' style, using exaggerated, rounded features and bold colors.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the cars accurately represented in the chibi car mascots without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi designs generally simplify features, and Image B exhibits cars with smooth surfaces lacking the fine details present in realistic depictions. The simplistic, cartoon-like rendering of these cars establishes a stylized, unnatural appearance which is typical in mascot designs, introducing artifacts like exaggerated lines.",

      "question": "Does the cereal box design with race-themed illustrations and metallic accents appear natural and cohesive without disrupting the overall visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cereal box with vibrant colors and cute illustrations that match the playful theme of the chibi car mascots. The design fits seamlessly with the overall theme, providing a cohesive element that does not disrupt visual harmony; however, the race-themed and metallic accents seem absent, indicating a mismatch in thematic execution compared to more mature, metallic racing motifs.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B sets the scene within a showroom-like environment which matches the playful, vibrant style of the chibi car mascots and the cereal packaging. Though the setting doesn't exactly replicate a realistic pit stop, it maintains structural coherence with its colorful and thematic presentation, ensuring visual plausibility within the stylized design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The execution in Image B successfully combines the chibi car mascots, cereal packaging, and the showroom setting into a unified design. There are no glaring artifacts or elements that appear out of place within its playful and stylized context, maintaining a cohesive visual experience throughout.",
