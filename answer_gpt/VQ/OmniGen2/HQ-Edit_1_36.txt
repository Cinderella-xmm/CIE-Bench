    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elderâ€™s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
    "explanation": "The facial features are blurred, but we will evaluate the surrounding context for realism. Based on the setting and detail present in other elements like hair and hanbok, the image aims for a stylized yet realistic representation. However, due to the nature of the edited image having a cartoon-like aesthetic overall, the expectation is for some smoothing characteristic of such designs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the floral patterns on the hanbok and surrounding foliage display consistent detail and alignment without visible repetition or blurring?",
    "explanation": "Reviewing the image, the floral elements on the hanbok and foliage show detailed and consistent alignment. They are well-rendered without noticeable repetition or blur, maintaining a cohesive design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the gradient transition across the hanbok's fabric smooth and continuous, with no sharp color breaks or unnatural banding effects?",
    "explanation": "Evaluating the hanbok, the gradient on the fabric transitions smoothly across the color spectrum. This is consistent with quality illustrations where attention is paid to gradient transitions to maintain continuity and avoid banding.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the green vine accents positioned behind the subject and aligned with the depth of the background, without appearing to float above or through solid structures?",

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the envelope frame fully aligned with the image boundaries, with no jagged edges, clipping errors, or mismatched shadowing?",
    "explanation": "The frame of the image appears perfectly aligned with no visible errors, jagged edges, or mismatched shadows. It is cleanly integrated, showcasing consistency in presentation typical of well-designed digital illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the edges of the hair, fabric folds, and floral elements sharp and clean without jagged lines, pixelation, or ghosting artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Examining the edges around key elements such as the hair, fabric folds, and floral details, they exhibit clean and sharp outlines. There is no evidence of jagged lines, pixelation, or ghosting artifacts, contributing to the crisp quality of the illustration.",
