      "question": "Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi knight in Image B is a stylized depiction, which commonly features exaggerated proportions and simplified textures. However, the key here is whether the metallic texture is consistent and natural. The armor in Image B appears to have a uniform metallic texture, which is expected as it mimics materials like steel or iron. There doesn't seem to be any warping or unnatural smoothing; the surfaces appear well-defined and coherent, showing a reflective quality consistent with metal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears visually coherent. The edges of the dome are well-defined, and realistic light refraction is visible, which suggests a transparent material. The elements inside—the knight, sheep, and dragon—are completely enclosed without any clipping or intersecting issues, making it appear as if they are naturally contained within the dome.",

      "question": "Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield in Image B maintains an embossed design similar to that of Image A. Despite the chibi style, which often simplifies details, the shield retains a sense of depth and detail in its patterns. The metallic sheen is evident as it reflects light, indicating the shield is made of metal. There doesn't appear to be any unnatural flatness, and the details are sufficiently pronounced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep are noticeably smaller than the knight, which is consistent with expected proportions given the chibi style. The wool texture is simplified but appears natural within the context of the design. The sheep are placed solidly on the ground surface with no indication of floating or clipping, which is important for maintaining visual realism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dragon’s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon has a stylized depiction, which fits the chibi art style. Its body does not intersect with the turret; instead, it is positioned alongside it. While the chibi style may simplify textures, the dragon's body maintains a consistent appearance that suggests a scaly texture, and there are no visible gaps or deformation.",
