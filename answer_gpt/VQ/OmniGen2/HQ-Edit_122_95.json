      "question": "Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows that the mosaic pattern on the saree is depicted uniformly with consistent tesserae size and alignment. The tiles appear seamless and without distortion, mimicking an idealized mosaic design. Common knowledge about mosaics suggests that uniformity is desired for a polished aesthetic.",
