      "question": "Are the moko tattoos on the warrior’s face, chest, arms, and back continuous and free from broken lines or pixelated textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moko tattoos are depicted with clean and precise lines that are continuous across the face, chest, arms, and back, without visible breaks or pixelation. This indicates a high level of detail and a smooth texture for the tattoos. The appearance reflects a polished and professional depiction, consistent with native warrior tattoo art that is ceremonial, hence it usually showcases intricate, undistorted designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the flax fibers of the piupiu skirt and leg wraps maintain natural variation in length, thickness, and shading without appearing overly smooth or synthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piupiu skirt and leg wraps appear to have some variation in length and shading, which mimics the natural look of flax fibers. Although there is a simplicity inherent in the digital representation, it achieves a reasonable authenticity by avoiding uniformity and overly smooth textures. The visual appearance aligns with common hand-crafted garment attributes, where slight inconsistencies enhance realism.",

      "question": "Are the warrior’s limbs positioned naturally with correct joint alignment and muscle tension, avoiding exaggerated or impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warrior's limbs in Image B are rendered with anatomically correct joint positions and muscle tension. The pose is dynamic and indicative of a stance seen in cultural performances, where knees are bent, and arms are placed outward in a manner consistent with human physiology and motion. There are no exaggerated or anatomically impossible bends, ensuring the depiction remains realistic.",

      "question": "Does the carved-wood title banner have realistic wood texture, proper shadowing, and edge integration with the background without appearing to float or clip unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carved-wood title banner has a textured appearance that mimics the grain of wood, with shadowing that enhances its depth and integration into the scene. The edges are smoothly integrated, showing controlled lighting effects, which prevent it from appearing as if it is floating or improperly aligned. This suggests thoughtful design to merge the banner with the background harmoniously.",

      "question": "Are the stat bars clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned without overlapping or distorting the warrior’s figure or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stat bars in Image B are set apart clearly at the bottom section of the card. They are uniformly spaced, allowing for easy visibility of the text without interfering with the depiction of the warrior or background. The visual layout ensures that all elements retain focus and are ordered logically, which is essential for card-style presentations.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the metallic frame edges have uniform thickness, smooth curves, and realistic reflections that align with the lighting direction in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic frame edges in Image B exhibit a consistent thickness and smoothly rendered curves. The reflections appear to be well-calibrated with the scene's lighting direction, which adds to the realism of the frame's material properties, giving an impression of polished metal. The rendering enhances the authentic look of a structured card, fitting into the overall design.",

      "question": "Is the nameplate positioned centrally beneath the warrior, with appropriate size and material texture that matches the stylistic theme without visual dissonance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nameplate on Image B is centrally located beneath the warrior, ensuring it is balanced within the card's format. It is well-sized to be noticeable yet not overpowering, and the texture aligns stylistically with the overall theme, maintaining visual harmony and preventing any disharmonic element that might clash with other card components.",
