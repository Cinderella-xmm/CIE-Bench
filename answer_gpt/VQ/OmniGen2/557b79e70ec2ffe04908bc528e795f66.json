        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the face is intentionally blurred, which obscures the facial features, making it impossible to determine alignment or proportional consistency of elements like eyes, nose, and mouth. As such, it is not possible to evaluate the presence of alignment or distortion in Image B.",
