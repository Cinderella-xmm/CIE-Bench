      "question": "Does the city skyline in the mirror maintain realistic lighting and contrast, matching the ambient light of the bathroom?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image B, the city skyline inside the mirror shows nighttime with artificial lights and a deep blue sky. The ambient light in the bathroom is soft and warm, emanating mostly from the lamp above the mirror. Despite the contrast between the nighttime scene and the bathroom's warm lighting, the skyline reflects a realistic lighting scenario typical for a city at night. The contrast between the warm indoor lighting and the cool tones of the skyline are realistic due to the intrinsic properties of different lighting environments, hence they match effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details in the city skyline clear and sharp, without unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's skyline features clearly distinguishable buildings, lights, and a sharp horizon line, which indicates sharp texture and detail. The natural, crisp outlines of the skyscrapers and the clarity of the city lights demonstrate high resolution and avoid any blurring or pixelation, which supports that the textures and details are maintained properly.",

      "question": "Does the skyline fit perfectly within the mirror's frame without distorting the geometric shape or overflowing its borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the city skyline perfectly contained within the mirror frame. The skyline is evenly distributed and aligned within the mirrorâ€™s boundaries, respecting the rectangular shape and showing no signs of distortion or overflow beyond its frame, which ensures the geometric integrity is retained.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the city skyline in the mirror complement the bathroom's interior without clashing with elements like the marble countertop or fixtures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image contains a sharp contrast between the city skyline and the warm, polished marble and brass details of the bathroom. Nevertheless, the nighttime cityscape can complement such neutral and sophisticated design choices by offering a sleek, modern touch, harmonizing with the existing elements rather than clashing. The modern vibe of the skyline is capable of enhancing the luxury feel of the marble and brass fixtures.",

      "question": "Are the original bathroom elements around the mirror (such as the light above and objects on the countertop) unaffected and retain their natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, besides the change within the mirror, all elements surrounding it remain unchanged. The light fixture, soap dispenser, and vase on the countertop display a natural look consistent with image A, indicating that these elements are unaffected by the editing process.",
