      "question": "Do the two central tree trunks retain the original towers' vertical proportions and cylindrical form without unnatural tapering or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central structures are depicted as massive tree trunks, which visually maintain a cylindrical form similar to towers. The trunks do not exhibit any unnatural tapering or distortions and appear vertically proportioned, resembling the original towers in Image A. The visual information in Image B supports that the trunks share a consistent cylindrical geometry aligned with the common expectations for such structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches extending from the trunks seamlessly connected and positioned in a way that follows natural growth patterns, without floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B appear to extend naturally from the trunks, following logical growth patterns typical for large trees. They seem to be seamlessly connected and anchored to the trunks without any floating or misaligned segments, which aligns with what can be expected in well-rendered, cohesive tree imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing leaves at the top of the structure emit a soft, diffused green light that blends with ambient lighting and does not produce sharp halos or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves on the tree appear to emit a soft, diffuse glow. This lighting effect is consistent with the ambient green hues and does not produce any harsh halos or overexposed areas. The transitions and blending appear smooth, consistent with natural lighting effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the root-like spirit figures embedded in the ground smoothly blended with the terrain and free of visible pixelation, edge artifacts, or unnatural translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ground in Image B, including the root-like structures (if present), appears to be blended smoothly with the terrain. There are no visible signs of pixelation, edge artifacts, or unnatural translucency in the ground transitions, resulting in a coherent and believable composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark textures on the trunks and branches show variation in shading and detail consistent with real tree surfaces, without uniform patterns or repeated brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bark textures on the tree trunks and branches in Image B display variations in shading and detail that are consistent with those found on real tree surfaces. The depiction avoids uniform patterns or repetitive brush strokes, providing a natural and varied texture expected in realistic tree imagery.",
