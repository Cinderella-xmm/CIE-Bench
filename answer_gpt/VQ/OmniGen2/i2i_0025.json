      "question": "Does the woman’s face exhibit natural contours and shading without visible unnatural textures or blotches in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s body and hand showcase smooth and blended colors typical of a watercolor style. The transition of tones is gentle, contributing to a natural and consistent look with no visible blotches or textural inconsistencies. The contours are clear and defined, congruent with watercolor effects where shading appears softer and less detailed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in the background of Image B display a simplified depiction, characteristic of watercolor paintings. The use of light lines and washes creates a smoother appearance, which aligns with standard watercolor techniques that focus on fluidity and simplicity. There are no unnatural geometric shapes or inconsistencies that break the form’s cohesion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hand holds the wine glass with an accurate representation of five fingers. The fingers are naturally curved and spaced, reflecting a realistic posture. This aligns with traditional watercolor techniques that simplify yet preserve fundamental anatomy without introducing distortion or artifacts.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wine glass in Image B is depicted with transparency and subtle reflections, which mirror its real-life properties. This suggests attention to detail in maintaining its essential character, even within a stylized watercolor format. The delicate balance in retaining glass reflections successfully conveys realism without over-stylization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and spatial interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear both logical and consistent with the lighting direction. The positioning supports a natural scene composition, ensuring the elements are grounded without giving rise to distortion or misplacement; this reveals careful consideration in the watercolor adaptation.",
