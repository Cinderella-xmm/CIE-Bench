    "Question": "Q1: Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the batik patterns on the dancer's dress appear sharp and well-defined, without noticeable pixelation or jagged edges. The patterns look continuous, suggesting a high-quality digital rendering. This assessment is based on the observation of smooth lines and consistent detailing in the pattern. Hence, they seem free from digital artifacts.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guardian statues flanking the pathway appear similar in size and pose, creating a symmetrical composition around the central temple axis. They have identical styling, which aids in balancing the design of the illustration. Comparison with Image A further confirms this symmetry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
