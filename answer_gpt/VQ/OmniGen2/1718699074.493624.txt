    "Question": "Q1: Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous panels are designed to adhere to the contours of the structure, as seen on the head statue. These panels seem to be seamlessly integrated into the structure, following the same shape and curvature without any noticeable inconsistencies. This alignment suggests a precise design that maintains the overall shape and aesthetic of the original structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "The neon animations on the panels in Image B appear to be smooth and continuous. There is no evidence of pixelation or fragmentation, indicating a high-quality and seamless representation of digital light patterns, maintaining clarity and visual integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
    "explanation": "The synthetic foliage in Image B emits a uniform, soft glow, creating a visually appealing effect. Each plant form has a well-defined structure and depth, appearing lifelike and three-dimensional rather than flat or decal-like. This suggests attention to detail in the fabrication process.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic surfaces of the buildings have a consistent, reflective quality, exhibiting natural variations in reflection characteristic of metal. There are no signs of distortion or stretched textures, which would otherwise compromise the realism of the surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
    "explanation": "The alignment of the head and pedestal in Image B appears consistent with the surrounding environment. They are visually in line with the horizon and adjacent buildings, exhibiting no angular distortions or mismatches in perspective, which maintains the overall coherence of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
