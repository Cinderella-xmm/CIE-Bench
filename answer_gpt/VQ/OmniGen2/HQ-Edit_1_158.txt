    "Question": "Q1: Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the woman is shown in a simplistic, stylized form rather than a detailed or realistic anatomical representation. This silhouette does not give a clear indication of anatomical proportions like limbs or bends, as it is an artistic rendering meant to convey the idea of a person reading rather than a detailed representation. Based on artistic interpretation and silhouette style, it maintains a coherent form without any visible misalignment or distortion given its artistic style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the womanâ€™s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette style means the book is oversized compared to the figure; however, this serves an artistic purpose in the illustration. The book does not appear to float or clip through the chair or body since no chair is depicted, keeping the context within a flat, artistic representation. Hence, in terms of silhouette art, proportional consistency serves a symbolic rather than realistic representation purpose.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a simplified, stylized silhouette with abstract detailing rather than realistic textures. Thus, details such as lace within this silhouette are flat and symbolic, not requiring seamless integration with knit textures in a realistic sense. The question does not apply well to the abstract style used in Image B, as the silhouette does not incorporate those specific textures or patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the simplified bookshelves maintain coherent shelf structure with aligned edges and realistic spacing between books, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks bookshelves entirely as part of the silhouette and abstract design; hence, the question does not apply because no bookshelf elements are present to judge. Image B shifts away from realism by offering a clean and clear background without attempting to incorporate objects such as bookshelves, thereby avoiding any misalignment issues within the context of how it was crafted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the antique-gold cardstock background uniformly textured and lit, with no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches that separate it from the central figure and other elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is an antique-gold color which appears to be uniformly textured and lit across the card. There are no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches evident since the entire setup is created to be abstract and uniform, ensuring consistency across the visual representation of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
