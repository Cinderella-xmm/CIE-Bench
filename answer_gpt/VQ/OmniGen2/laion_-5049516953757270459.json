      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO avocado half is crafted using LEGO bricks, which inherently have flat surfaces and right angles. Despite the use of green bricks to mimic the avocado's curve, the result cannot be entirely smooth due to the nature of LEGO construction. However, the assembly appears intentional to represent a rounded form, as much as the bricks allow, without significant jagged or broken shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts what seems to be blueberries and raspberries using round LEGO bricks, common for replicating spherical objects. These LEGO bricks are uniformly rounded and individually positioned, thus maintaining their spherical form, avoiding merging into irregular shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The broccoli in Image B is recreated using LEGO bricks to convey a textured, tree-like structure. LEGO pieces are chosen to represent florets, closely resembling the complex branching seen in actual broccoli. While simplified, the rendition avoids collapsing or losing its distinct layered form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red bell pepper is represented using red LEGO bricks. These bricks are combined as closely as possible to simulate a smooth curve, but inherent angularity exists due to LEGO's nature. The alignment strives for minimal gaps, creating a consistent appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped board's edge in Image B aligns closely with the wooden board's contour from Image A. While LEGO might introduce minor deviations due to blocky construction, the shape in Image B mimics the original's outline effectively without obvious breaks or irregularities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not present a LEGO interpretation of asparagus stalks bound together. Instead, the arrangement of bricks is general and lacks distinct twine representation, contrasting with Image A's detailed bundling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B places the LEGO heart-shaped board on a consistent gray background. This uniformity avoids shadows or highlights that introduce depth inconsistencies, enhancing the clarity of the display.",
