      "question": "Does the mirror-like surface in the foreground reflect the sky, trees, and Eiffel Tower with clear, undistorted imagery and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror-like surface in the foreground appears to be a rectangular pool. It does not reflect clear imagery of the sky, trees, or Eiffel Tower as it is not depicted as a reflective surface in the edited image. Instead, it serves as more of a decorative element without significant reflection. World knowledge tells us that reflective surfaces like water or mirrors should display clear reflections if they are indeed intended to reflect objects or scenery clearly. Therefore, the depiction in Image B does not suggest clear reflections, contrary to the question prompt.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant buildings and tree clusters positioned at distinct depth layers without overlapping or misaligned edges that suggest incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the image, distant buildings and tree clusters in Image B are visibly distinguishable and maintain correct layering without overlapping edges. Buildings are placed behind the trees, giving the illusion of depth, which is consistent with world knowledge of spatial perspectives in visual depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the small pedestrian figures on the pathways have consistent proportions, recognizable body parts, and smooth textures without visible deformities or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestrians are represented with crude and simplified forms due to the artistic style of the image. They do not have detailed features or recognizable body parts as seen in typical realistic depictions. Instead, they are emblematic, serving more as symbols. This approach results in figures with no visible deformities or clipping artifacts since their design intention is minimalistic, not detailed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the dark frame with metallic edges present around the entire perimeter of the image, appearing solid and uniformly integrated without breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dark frame with metallic edges encompassing the perimeter of the image. It appears consistent and without misalignments, as it is uniformly integrated into the composition. The frame's presence supports the intended representation of this image as a framed artwork or display box.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the engraved city names and coordinates along the frame legible, precisely aligned, and free from pixelation or uneven spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the provided portion of Image B, the engraved text along the frame, including city names and coordinates, is presented. However, upon close inspection, this text is not entirely legible and appears to use a fictitious script or design. It does feature uneven spacing in places, suggesting stylization rather than functional legibility. These observations indicate the text functions decoratively rather than informationally.",
