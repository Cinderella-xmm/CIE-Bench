      "question": "Are the brushstrokes applied to the man’s clothing and headwrap consistent in direction and intensity, maintaining the pattern’s integrity without distorting the fabric’s shape or introducing pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstrokes applied to the man's clothing and headwrap showcase a vibrant and intentional artistic style. The brushstrokes follow the natural folds and contours of the fabric, maintaining the pattern's integrity. The vibrant colors are consistent in direction and intensity, without showing any pixelation or smudging. The textile pattern is visually uninterrupted, reflecting a well-executed paint effect that enhances rather than distorts the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the background blur smooth and uniform across the horizon, with no jagged edges, double contours, or inconsistent color patches that break the continuity of the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background demonstrates a smooth and uniform application of colors with a stylized approach. The blurred background exhibits a seamless transition across the horizon without any noticeable jagged edges, double contours, or inconsistent color patches. This creates a cohesive and idyllic landscape that supports the overall aesthetic of the image.",

      "question": "Does the drum retain its circular shape and consistent rim structure, with paint layers applied in a way that follows the curvature without flattening or stretching the surface unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drum retains its circular shape and the structure of its rim is consistent. The paint layers are applied thoughtfully, accentuating the natural curvature of the drum. There is no evidence of flattening or stretching that would distort the drum's appearance, allowing it to maintain its three-dimensional form and contribute to the realism of the composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the stylized grass and tree forms elongated or curved in a way that suggests motion but still preserve recognizable plant structures, such as upright trunks and branching patterns, without appearing fragmented or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized grass and tree forms in Image B are portrayed with a sense of motion, evident in their elongated and slightly curved forms. Despite this artistic rendering, the plants preserve recognizable structures, with trees showing upright trunks and identifiable branching patterns. These elements remain complete and grounded, avoiding any sense of fragmentation or floating appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display five distinct fingers with anatomically correct spacing and joint alignment, and are the fingers proportionally sized relative to the arms and drum without appearing stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands of the figure are depicted with five distinct fingers. The spacing and joint alignment are anatomically correct, ensuring a natural appearance. The fingers are proportionately sized in relation to the arms and drum, avoiding any indication of being stretched or compressed. This attention to detail reinforces the realistic portrayal of human anatomy within the artistic style.",
