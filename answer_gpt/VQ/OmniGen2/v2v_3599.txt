    "Question": "Q1: Do the armored medieval knights maintain the same size proportions relative to the crib and wall as the original stuffed animals did?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armored medieval knights appear almost the same size as the stuffed animals in Image A when compared to the crib and wall. This comparison indicates the knights maintain similar proportions to the objects in the room, reflecting a realistic integration into the scene. Common sense suggests that knights are typically larger, but in this fantasy scenario, they are stylized to match the size of plush toys.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are there any unnatural textures or color gradients where the knights' armor meets the floor or wall?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the transition from the knights' armor to the floor or wall appears smooth, without visible unnatural textures or abrupt color changes. The armor's edge smoothly connects with the floor and wall due to consistent lighting and shadowing, indicating a well-executed edit.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the armored medieval knights cast realistic shadows consistent with the lighting in the room?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the knights appear consistent with the lighting direction in the room. The shadows are visible on the floor and mimic the expected angles and lengths given the apparent light source, which also illuminates the crib and room assets similarly, indicating a coherent edit.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the knights positioned in a way that appears natural and plausible, as if they were sitting against the wall like the stuffed animals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the knights are placed standing with an upright posture, which differs from the sitting position of the stuffed animals in Image A. Given their rigid armor design, the standing position is more typical for knights, contrasting with the plush toysâ€™ natural seated pose.",
    "answer": "No"
