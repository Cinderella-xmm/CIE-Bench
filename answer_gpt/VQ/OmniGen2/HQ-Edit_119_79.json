      "question": "Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted with a body made from quartz and obsidian crystals. The shape and proportions appear consistent with the typical form of a seated cat. The crystals are crafted to fit the general shape of the cat's torso and legs, giving a balanced and proportionate appearance without apparent warping or unnatural breaks. The rigid, faceted quality of the crystals contrasts with the natural texture in Image A, but in terms of overall shape, the structure maintains feline proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the cat are replaced with bright emerald crystals. The eyes are accurately positioned within the cat's face, maintaining proper alignment and spacing relative to the other facial features. The size and shape of the crystal eyes seem consistent with natural cat eyes. The reflective quality of the crystal eyes enhances the appearance but does not detract from the structural integrity, aligning well with typical eye placement.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cat is seated, its front paws placed on a wooden base. The legs and paws appear proportionally sized and logically positioned on the base. There is no indication of floating or disconnection, suggesting that the stance is well-grounded and adheres to physical logic. The adherence to natural anatomy is visibly intact, displaying a consistent connection between the legs and the body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the cat are depicted using quartz and obsidian crystals. These surfaces show variations in translucency, particularly around the translucent quartz, and there are clear differences in shading and edge definitions. The crystal textures mimic what might be expected on real mineral surfaces, avoiding pixelation or unnatural smoothness. The depiction of these elements appears deliberate and realistic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block serves as a base for the crystal cat. The texture and color of the wood are consistent with a typical wooden surface, showcasing grain and shadowing present in Image A. The lighting seems coherent, as shadows are cast appropriately around the cat and the block. There is no indication of gaps or distortion around the shadows, maintaining visual continuity with what might be expected in natural light conditions.",
