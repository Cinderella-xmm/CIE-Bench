    "Question": "Q4: Do the sandy-colored spots on the plush dog’s ears and face maintain their original placement and shape as seen in the original image, without bleeding or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, since the face is blurred, it is difficult to assess any differences accurately regarding the placement and shape of the sandy-colored spots compared to Image A. Therefore focusing on other visible areas like the ears, there is no bleeding or distortion observed on those spots.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial features of the plush dog, including the snout, mouth, and nose, proportionally accurate and structurally coherent with the rest of the head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, due to face being blurred, it is not possible to assess the proportional accuracy or structural coherence of facial features like the snout, mouth, and nose. The task of evaluation is hindered because the crucial facial characteristics are not visible.",
    "answer": "No"
