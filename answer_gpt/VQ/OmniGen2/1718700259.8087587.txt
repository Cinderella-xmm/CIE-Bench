    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges and contours of the LEGO car body aligned with the original vehicle’s shape, with no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or warped sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO car is neatly constructed with blocks that form a unified structure without visible gaps or overlaps. The blocks create a shape reminiscent of the original vehicle's contour in Image A. Common knowledge about LEGO construction and the visual alignment seen suggests that the contours align with the original vehicle's shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the red and blue translucent LEGO pieces positioned exactly where the original emergency lights were, and do they appear transparent rather than solid or discolored?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the red and blue LEGO pieces matches the location of the emergency lights on the original vehicle in Image A. However, these LEGO pieces do not appear translucent, lacking transparency, which is an inherent property of LEGO bricks typically observed.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the window areas of the LEGO car consist of solid beige bricks without any transparent or see-through elements, making them visually inconsistent with real-world windows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows of the LEGO car are made from solid colored bricks, not transparent elements. This design choice differs from real-world windows, which are typically see-through. This results in visual inconsistency with what actual windows would look like.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the grille and wheel components built from small LEGO blocks that maintain the original patterns and shapes, with no missing, misaligned, or distorted pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the grille and wheels of the LEGO car appear to be constructed using smaller blocks that emulate the design patterns of the original vehicle in Image A. The pieces are well-aligned, and there are no obvious missing, misaligned, or distorted pieces when comparing them to the original vehicle's design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO car resting on a flat, uniform matte gray surface with no visible seams, texture mismatches, or lighting inconsistencies compared to the car’s shadow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface on which the LEGO car rests appears flat and uniformly matte gray with no visible seams or texture mismatches. The car's shadow is consistent with the lighting and surface, suggesting no lighting inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
