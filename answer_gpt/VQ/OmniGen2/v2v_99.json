      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D soccer player is distinctly cartoonish and stylized, contrasting with the realistic depiction of the soccer field and stadium. While it might be visually interesting, the difference between the cartoonish player and the realistic environment creates a noticeable inconsistency. The textures and shading of the chibi player do not match the realistic environmentâ€™s lighting and realism.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd still visually plausible and structurally coherent, without any distortions or unnatural textures introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soccer field, stadium, and crowd in Image B, excluding the chibi player, appear to remain in a realistic style similar to Image A. There are no apparent distortions or unnatural textures evident as a result of editing, maintaining their structural coherence and plausibility.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style interpretation inherently involves exaggerated proportions, such as a larger head and smaller body, typical of this style. However, these proportions are consistent with the chibi aesthetic and are not distorted or broken in a way that defies the logic of this art form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the chibi-style 3D soccer player look natural and free of any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials and textures of the chibi player are consistent with the smooth, simplified aesthetic typical of 3D chibi models. There are no unnatural artifacts present in the design, which maintains a cohesive look and smooth textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the action pose of the chibi-style 3D soccer player consistent with the original image, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The action pose of the chibi soccer player is similar to the pose of the original player, with an arm raised and one leg extended, which illustrates a soccer action. This maintains visual consistency in terms of the intended action and pose, even though the player itself is depicted in a different style.",
