    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated muscles on the athleteâ€™s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts an exaggerated, comic-book style with highly defined and enlarged muscles, typical of artistic illustrations rather than realistic portrayals.

    "Question": "Q4: Is the blank motivational quote panel aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it have consistent lighting and shadowing to appear as if part of the environment?",

It does not naturally integrate with the rest of the environment in terms of perspective or lighting, appearing superimposed rather than inherently part of the scene.",
