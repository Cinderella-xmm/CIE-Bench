    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the exaggerated and elongated clock tower retain its structural consistency and does it appear logically consistent with the original proportions of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows only a solid white color without any identifiable features. This suggests that any exaggerated elements have resulted in losing visual consistency and proportionality, making it impossible for them to logically maintain the original structural proportions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colorful geometric flowerbed rings natural in appearance, lacking any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a complete absence of visual features or geometry including color, hence losing any natural texture or detail that would have been present in flowerbed rings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition from the chibi-style illustration elements to the glossy enamel coloring look smooth and free of visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Without any visible elements in the edited image, there can be no smooth or artifact-free transition observed. The lack of color, illustration, or texture means there cannot be any smooth transition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the clock tower and flowerbed badge maintain a vertical, metallic structure consistent with a city souvenir badge, without any structural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image being a plain white block without visible features precludes the presence of any metallic structures or badges. The lack of visible detail indicates that structural consistency typical of a city souvenir badge is not upheld.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style transformation of the clock tower and flowerbed retain a natural and authentic appearance, avoiding any obvious distortions or unrealistic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the edited image is entirely white and the features of the clock tower and flowerbed are not visible, it means no transformation or authentic appearance can be assessed, indicating distortions or unrealistic elements likely occurred.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
