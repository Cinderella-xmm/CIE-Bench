      "question": "Are there any visible seams or unnatural edges where the watch meets the new steampunk-style background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is placed in a steampunk-style train station setting. A careful observation of the edges where the watch intersects with the background shows a smooth transition without any visible seams or unnatural edges. This suggests that the integration of the watch into the new background has been done seamlessly, maintaining a realistic appearance. The lighting and shadow appearance further support this, as there is no disparity indicating cut lines or mismatched edges.",

      "question": "Does the wristwatch retain its original proportions, geometric shapes, and fine details without distortion in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wristwatch appears consistent with typical proportions and geometry of a high-quality wristwatch, similar to its appearance in Image A. There are no visible distortions in its circular face, bezel, or band. The fine details, such as the minute markings and hands, remain sharp and precise, indicating that the proportions and details have been preserved during editing.",

      "question": "Do the textures and finishes on the watch's metal band and face appear natural and detailed, matching the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B features the watch against a different background, the textures and finishes of the watch, especially the bezel, face, and band, retain a high level of detail and clarity. The polished metal surfaces reflect light accurately, maintaining a realistic texture. This matches the expectation from Image A, indicating no loss of detail or texture in the transition.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the wristwatch match the light sources in the new steampunk-style train station background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is a warmly lit train station with visible lighting fixtures. The watch's reflections and shadows are consistent with the ambient lighting of the scene, with the warm tones of the background light reflecting subtly on the watch surfaces. This alignment suggests that the watch has been carefully integrated to match the scene's specific lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the original lighting and shadows around the watch been preserved without introducing unrealistic contrasts or overly bright/dark areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch maintains a balanced contrast similar to what would be expected under a consistent and diffused lighting source, as was the case in Image A. There are no unrealistic overly bright or dark areas that could indicate poor editing. Instead, the shadows and highlights appear natural, suggesting the preservation of the existing lighting characteristics or an effective adaptation to the new setting.",
