    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the brass and copper elements on the uniform show natural surface variations, such as subtle scratches, patina, and reflective highlights, without appearing uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass and copper elements on the uniform appear to have subtle surface variations characteristic of these materials. The light reflects off different surfaces in varied manners, creating natural highlights and shadows without indicating an exaggerated smoothness or artificial glossiness. This suggests attention to detail in rendering, accommodating for imperfections like slight scratches or a patina that typically occur on metallic surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gear components on the uniform properly embedded within the fabric structure, maintaining consistent depth and avoiding overlapping or misaligned teeth that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the gear components on the uniform, they appear to be expertly integrated into the fabric structure. The depth of embedding is consistent, and the mechanical teeth align accurately, maintaining geometric continuity. There is careful attention to the gear's interaction with the uniform, avoiding any overlapping or misalignments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mechanical throne have visible support structures and grounding that prevent it from appearing suspended or unstable, with all cogwheels and braces attached logically to the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical throne is designed with apparent support structures, ensuring it visually rests on a solid base. Cogwheels and braces are attached practically and logically, which contributes to a grounded appearance rather than a suspended or unstable look. This attention to detail provides a robust, realistic feel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the copper, brown, and dark green hues distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background, with transitions between colors following natural lighting gradients and avoiding abrupt or patchy changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image exhibits a balanced distribution of copper, brown, and dark green hues across the uniform, throne, and background. The color transitions are natural, facilitated by realistic lighting gradients, and avoid abrupt shifts or patchiness. This results in a cohesive and well-integrated color palette throughout the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the steam trails in the background have gradual opacity and wispy edges, flowing naturally from potential sources like vents or machinery, without sharp outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam trails depicted in the image possess a natural gradient in opacity, with wispy edges that suggest movement originating from possible sources like machinery. The steamâ€™s gradual transition and lack of sharp outlines or pixelation enhance its realism, effectively complementing the industrial theme of the setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands display five fingers with proper spacing and curvature, and are the knuckles and fingernails rendered with natural detail, without any fused, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in the image are depicted with accurate anatomical detail. Each hand shows five fingers with correct spacing and natural curvature. The knuckles and fingernails are rendered with realistic texture and detail, with no indication of fused, missing, or duplicated digits. This precise depiction contributes to the overall veracity of the subject's appearance.",
