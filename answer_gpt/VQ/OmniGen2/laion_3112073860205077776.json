    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the illustrated blueberries and text labels seamlessly integrated into the pie surface without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrated blueberries on the pie in Image B appear smooth and seamlessly integrated, with no pixelation or jagged edges commonly seen in poorly edited graphics. The illustration follows a consistent shading style, aligning with what is expected from clean graphical representations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the anthropomorphic version of the mug retain the original cylindrical shape and handle position without stretching, warping, or breaking the object's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The anthropomorphic mug in Image B maintains a cylindrical shape similar to a typical mug, and the handle is positioned like that of a regular mug. There are no signs of stretching, warping, or distortion in its shape, indicating that the object form is preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chart positioned clearly within the frame without overlapping or obscuring the pie slice, mug, or plate, and does it have clean lines and legible text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chart in Image B is positioned away from the pie slice and mug, providing sufficient space for each element. The lines of the chart are clean, and while the text is mostly correctly formed, some words are not legible, suggesting that parts are not well-integrated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the warm pastel tones applied evenly across the scene without causing unnatural discoloration of the ceramic, glass, or baked pie surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene uses vibrant colors, with the warm tones primarily in the background and illustrations. However, these tones do not appear across the physical objects like the mug and pie in a natural manner, which results in the pie and mug having unnatural colors compared to usual pastel tones.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pie slice, mug, plate, and table maintain their original geometric forms and spatial relationships without any visible warping, fragmentation, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie slice, mug, and plate are illustrated with geometric forms capturing typical shapes. Though the illustrations mimic these forms, the depicted scene changes from a photo to a stylized graphic, which may not precisely reflect the original spatial relationships and forms but maintains the key features.",
