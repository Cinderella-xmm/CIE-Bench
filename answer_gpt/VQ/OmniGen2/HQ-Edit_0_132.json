      "question": "Do the three figures retain anatomically correct body proportions and natural hand shapes (with no more than five fingers per hand) after being stylized as ink-painting poets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are stylized within the context of traditional ink paintings, which often focus on elegance and simplicity rather than exact anatomical accuracy. Despite the stylization, the proportions of the figures in Image B appear balanced with respect to traditional artistic conventions. The hands also seem to have thoughtfully considered shapes with no more than five fingers visible, adhering to natural limits.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the willow branches and lotus leaves rendered with smooth, flowing brushstrokes that preserve their natural form and do not exhibit jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the willow branches and lotus leaves are depicted using smooth brushstrokes characteristic of ink-style art, which typically focuses on fluid lines and graceful forms. There are no visible jagged edges or texture artifacts, resulting in an aesthetic that maintains the natural essence of these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mountain background feature soft, layered ink-wash gradients that blend naturally with the surrounding mist and sky without sharp transitions or artificial blur effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are presented with soft gradients typical of ink-wash paintings, leading into the mist and sky with seamless transitions. Ink-wash art often uses gradation to evoke depth and atmosphere, and in this depiction, the mountains blend smoothly with their environment without abrupt changes or artificial effects.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the arm and hand positions of the figures show natural joint alignment and fluid motion, with no bent or missing fingers or unnatural limb extensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B display arm and hand positions that suggest fluidity and natural movement, consistent with traditional ink painting techniques that focus on grace and expression. There is no evidence of bent or missing fingers, nor any unnatural extremities or joints, which are critical for maintaining a cohesive style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ink-style elements (figures, willows, lotuses, mountains) harmoniously integrated into the scene with consistent lighting, shadow, and depth cues, and do they avoid appearing detached or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ink-style elements are integrated within a coherent visual environment, highlighted by consistent lighting and depth cues. The figures, vegetation, and landscape elements each contribute to a unified pictorial harmony, avoiding a sense of detachment or misplacement from the scene.",
