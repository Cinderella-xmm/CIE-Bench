      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle's body appears uniformly cylindrical with no signs of warping or brick misalignment. The LEGO construction implies a segmented appearance typical of brick structures, but it maintains a cylindrical shape. The translucency of the green material gives an impression of visual consistency that aligns well with the cylindrical form observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all brand text elements (e.g., \"BACARDÍ\", \"MOJITO\") and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand text elements, 'BACARDÍ' and 'MOJITO,' as well as the logo, appear clearly legible and properly aligned on the label without any distortion or missing characters. The text sizes and alignment maintain consistency with recognizable settings, indicating accurate representation and layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the cap as a cylindrical component, maintaining consistent proportional dimensions relative to the bottle's neck. The cap’s smooth, rounded top indicates well-designed integration without angular inconsistencies, mirroring typical LEGO parts when perceived through visual cues.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelf appears flat and horizontally aligned, supporting the bottle without signs of uneven edges or floating segments. Its geometric integrity implies that the shelf is appropriately integrated and visually stable within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the smaller text elements such as \"natural mint flavor\" and \"Simply pour over ice\" fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smaller text elements on Image B, like 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice,' show distortions and are not clearly visible. They appear compromised through spacing and clarity, leading to fragmented visibility which indicates a lack of coherence in lettering.",
