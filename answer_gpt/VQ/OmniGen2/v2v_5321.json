      "question": "Do the stripes on the character's costume maintain their clarity and definition without unnatural blurring or distortion in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the character's costume are well-defined and smooth, typical of a claymation style where details are simplified and polished to give a cartoonish and coherent appearance. The stripes are evenly spaced and maintain a steady contrast with the base color of the shirt, showing no signs of blurring or distortion. Comparing with Image A, the real image of the shirt also shows crisp and clear stripes, confirming the transition to claymation has preserved this detail without unnatural artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the beret retain its original shape and placement on the character's head without appearing unnaturally warped or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beret appears smooth and well-positioned on the character's head, typical for the cleaner and outlined style of claymation. It sits comfortably and naturally on the character's head with the correct orientation. Comparing with Image A, the beret in the original photo also sits naturally and has a clearly defined form. The claymation style has retained the original shape and placement accurately.",

      "question": "Are the fingers on the character's hand holding the phone naturally shaped and textured, without any unnatural distortions or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character's fingers with smooth and clear outlines, typical for claymation where human hands are simplified, but still show natural curves and position. The fingers appear proportionate and properly holding the front of the phone. In comparison, Image A illustrates realistic hand positioning and accurate details. The edited image maintains the important aspects of natural hand positioning even in its stylized form, without any distortion or missing elements.",

      "question": "Do the European rooftops and buildings in the background retain their structural integrity and visual plausibility without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooftops and buildings are simplified and rounded, contributing to the claymation aesthetic, yet they appear structurally sound and contextually plausible. The stylization doesn't compromise their visual integrity, as they maintain correct proportions and recognizable forms. Image A contains realistic and clearly delineated structures, which have been successfully translated into a claymation style without sacrificing the logical architectural features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character's pose, including the way they hold the phone, appear natural and consistent with human ergonomics in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures the character in a stance consistent with human ergonomics. The hand gripping the phone and the other hand on the hip give the character a balanced stance, common in claymation styles where expressiveness is key. This is consistent with Image A, where the person is posed in a casual manner holding a phone. The claymation retains this ergonomic consistency, adding to its charm without altering the authenticity of the pose.",
