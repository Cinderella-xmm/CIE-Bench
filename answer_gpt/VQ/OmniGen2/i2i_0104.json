    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" introduce any unnatural textures or visibly distorted areas on the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Warm Home' and 'Adopt Love' are added in the background and do not touch the cat's detailed features such as fur, whiskers, or eyes. Based on common sense, text placement typically does not induce distortion in adjacent objects if placed properly, which is evident here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the placement of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" maintain structural consistency and avoid disrupting the proportions and physical rationality of the cat's face and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is positioned around the cat and doesn't intrude on its face or body. The cat's proportions and structure appear consistent and are not undermined by overlapping text placement, which aligns with standard image editing practices.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the natural appearance and authenticity of the cat's expression, fur pattern, and posture been preserved despite the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cat with vibrant fur patterns and a natural posture, clearly visible beneath and around the text elements. The appearance suggests that the text addition does not alter its expression or authenticity, maintaining realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the cat, such as individual strands of fur, whiskers, and paw pads, free from blurring or pixelation after the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image maintains clarity in the depiction of the cat's fur, whiskers, and paw pads, with no evident blurring or pixelation. This suggests that the addition of text did not degrade the image quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" into the image avoid logical inconsistencies such as overlapping unnaturally with the cat's fur or appearing embedded in a way that defies common sense?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is placed above the cat, properly isolated, and does not overlap or embed within the fur in a manner that defies logic. It is integrated logically above the cat, consistent with the composition process for adding text to an image.",
