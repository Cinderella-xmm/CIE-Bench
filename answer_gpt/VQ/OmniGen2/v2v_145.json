      "question": "Do the enlarged and shiny mango pieces retain their natural texture and shape without appearing distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces are significantly enlarged and have a shiny effect that gives them a smooth, plasticky appearance similar to cartoon or artificial fruit props. This differs from the natural variations and textures expected from real mango pieces. The alterations in texture and appearance make them appear unnatural compared to real fruit and go beyond merely enhancing visual appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cartoon-like design of the lime and chili powder bowl appear visually credible and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime and chili powder bowl exhibit an exaggerated cartoon-like design as evidenced by the bright colors, smooth textures, and uniform shapes. These features are consistent with illustrations or computer-generated images rather than natural objects. The smooth texture of the lime and the consistent shape of the bowl don't show signs of unusual distortion or artifacts, maintaining its credibility within this whimsical style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the edited elements, including the whimsical mango figurine, lime, and chili powder bowl, visually credible and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B integrates elements harmoniously, as seen with the consistent style where the cartoon-like lime, chili powder bowl, and the whimsical mango figurine are placed logically on the plate. The visual aesthetics align with a playful and whimsical theme, avoiding incongruent placement or jarring transitions between the elements.",

      "question": "Does the shiny 3D effect on the mango pieces enhance the visual appeal without degrading fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shiny 3D effect on mango pieces gives them a sleek appearance but compromises the natural appeal by smoothing out fine textures and introducing a non-realistic look. While the increased polish may enhance cartoon style appeal, it notably alters the natural fruit texture, creating an artificial look lacking detailed surface finishes typical in depictions of real fruit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the whimsical mango figurine retain its structural integrity and natural appearance, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whimsical mango figurine in Image B appears structurally sound, with well-defined shapes and smooth lines typical of stylized cartoon characters. There are no broken geometric shapes or distortions, and the character design embodies cartoon-like integrity without issues in form or proportion.",
