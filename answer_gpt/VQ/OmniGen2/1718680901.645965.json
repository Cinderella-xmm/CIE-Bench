    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the spires and roof layers of the creature aligned with the original building's structure, showing no signs of bending, breaking, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spires and roof layers are meticulously aligned, showing a seamless continuity in the architectural design. The sharp, pointed spires are symmetric and rise vertically, with no signs of misalignment or structural flaws like bending or breaking. This precision reflects the design integrity often found in detailed architectural structures. In comparison to Image A, where the architecture also appears structurally sound, Image B retains this consistency without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the orb at the creature’s feet feature pillars and arches that match the architectural style of the creature and have consistent texture and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb in Image B is designed with decorative patterns that share thematic consistency with the architectural style of the building. It bears similar color tones and lighting, suggesting the same material and design origin. The consistent lighting and texture indicate a harmonious integration into the scene. Image A does not feature an orb for comparison, but the orb's design elements in Image B seem thoughtfully integrated with the overall architectural theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the invented name displayed near the creature legible, properly sized, and positioned without overlapping the creature or water reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the name 'STERT MAINICAL' is clearly visible, placed near the steps and designed to fit the scene appropriately. The text is legible and does not overlap with the building or its reflection in the water, ensuring clarity and deliberate placement. This positioning and sizing reflect thoughtful design to maintain visibility and aesthetic integrity. There is no direct comparison necessary with Image A since Image B introduces this new element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elemental type label (e.g., Mystic, Stone) visible near the creature and styled to match the overall fantasy aesthetic without appearing digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no specific elemental type label like 'Mystic' or 'Stone' is easily visible or apart from 'STERT MAINICAL,' which was addressed previously. However, if considering any label within the visible elements, they are woven into the design without appearing artificially added or digitally pasted, blending well with the surroundings. This suggests a considered approach to visual integration, steering clear of elements that might seem out of place. Without explicit labels visible, this question assumes the overall textual integration observed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature’s surface display smooth shading and consistent texture across all architectural elements, with no visible pixelation, blurring, or unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural structure has smooth shading and a consistent texture that matches across the building. The lighting appears even and natural, with shadows and highlights providing depth to the structure. There are no visible instances of pixelation, blurring, or unnatural color patches disrupting the visual harmony. This consistency suggests a high-quality digital rendering that maintains realism within the fantasy architecture aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the creature’s limbs proportionally sized and structurally connected to the main body in a way that suggests physical stability and logical weight distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to conceptualize an architectural structure, not as a literal creature with limbs or biological anatomy. The architectural 'limbs,' such as columns and roof extensions, are proportionately integrated into the structure. They are logically connected to the main architectural body, promoting a sense of stability and balanced weight distribution. This is consistent with sound architectural principles and suggests sturdy construction. The design provides logical coverage for all structural components without anomalies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the water reflection accurately mirror the creature, orb, and any nearby text, showing correct orientation and lighting without warping or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water reflection below the architectural structure accurately mirrors the building and text, such as 'STERT MAINICAL.' The reflection is properly oriented, with consistent lighting that mimics the illumination of the scene above water. There is an absence of warping or ghosting effects, indicating a faithfully rendered reflection that matches what is visually present, thus maintaining the realism required in reflections. Compared with Image A, where the reflection also appears accurate, Image B sustains this precision.",
