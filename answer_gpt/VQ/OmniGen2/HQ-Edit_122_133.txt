    "Question": "Q1: Do the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay have proportionally correct limbs and body structures that maintain anatomical plausibility without visible deformations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are depicted anthropomorphically, meaning they are given characteristics or postures that may not be biologically accurate for real birds but instead are stylized to fit a certain artistic style or theme, similar to cartoon character design. Their limbs and body structures are exaggerated or stylized to match a certain theme. Evaluating this in terms of 'anatomical plausibility' would mean checking if within the style, nothing appears distorted or incorrectly depicted relative to the intended form. Based on these criteria, the birds appear proportionate and follow a consistent stylistic design without apparent deformations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay rendered with clear, consistent texture and stitching, free from pixelation, blurring, or material inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are not shown wearing any attire, such as Victorian garments. They appear as stylized representations set in an ornately designed setting. Thus, the question of analyzing the garments for texture and stitching details is not applicable as no clothing is present in this depiction.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the miniature stage and alcove elements positioned with proper depth and alignment, and do icicles and pine accents adhere to gravitational and spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are displayed in a glass case with a diorama setting, each on a miniature platform with decorative elements, including snow and small trees. These elements appear well-aligned, with the edges of the glass case and decorative details like icicles on top of the platforms adhering to gravity and spatial logic. The position of snow-covered features and the dotted arrangement of small pine representations comply with visual norms for such dioramas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are all miniature seasonal elements (e.g., ornaments, snowflakes) properly scaled, cast realistic shadows, and aligned with the lighting direction of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the case includes miniature stages with snow and tiny trees, emphasizing a winter setting. The shadows appear uniformly cast beneath these elements, consistent with light sources depicted at the top of each compartment. The scale of snowfall and decorations corresponds with the whole diorama presentation, maintaining a coherent proportion to the bird figures and platform size, thus ensuring a realistic and consistent presentation aligned with lighting direction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the split-frame border clean and seamless, with no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding at the boundary between the two scenes?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not follow a split-frame design like Image A. Instead, it consists of a single, cohesive scene without a visible division between two parts. Hence, there are no split-frame borders present that could contain artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding. As Image B is captured in a single-shot perspective within an enclosed display case, the question regarding a split-frame border is not relevant.",
    "answer": "No"
