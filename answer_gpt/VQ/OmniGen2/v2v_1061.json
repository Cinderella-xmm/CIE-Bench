      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the badge maintain the same level of detail and texture as the vibrant domes and intricate patterns of the building, avoiding unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge depicts the distinctive architecture of the building, preserving the vibrant colors and intricate patterns typically associated with such architectural elements. The badge effectively translates these details without introducing any discernible unnatural texture or losing the intricate detail of the building. This is evident by the clear, sharp contours and vibrant appearance, matching the real-world expectation of the architectural style. Without comparing directly to Image A, the badge retains sufficient detail and texture based on its presentation in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes and proportions of the badge consistent with the architectural style of the building, ensuring no distortion or breakage of shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge accurately reflects the geometric proportions seen in the architectural style of the building, with no visible distortion or breakage of shapes. Analyzing the domes and spires suggests adherence to the symmetrical and uniform patterns typical of such structures. The visual cues strongly suggest that the badge has been designed to maintain these proportions, with the shapes consistent with what is expected from this architectural style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the tassel material of the badge appear soft and flexible, and does the circular form look natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a tassel on the badge. Focusing on what is present, Image B showcases a circular badge with a sharply defined edge, but its circular form appears natural and without distortion. The presentation of the badge in an animated style ensures it seems balanced and clear, but without a tassel, considerations of material flexibility aren't possible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the hand presenting the badge have a natural appearance, with no more than five fingers, and do the lines and shapes conform to ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand depicted in Image B bears a natural appearance tailored to the animated style, and conforms well to the ergonomic structure expected of a hand. The presence of fingers—no more than five—and the overall shape align with common portrayals of human anatomy. The hand's positioning and contour complement the task of presenting the badge, appearing logical and suitably aligned with an expected ergonomic form.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the badge integrate seamlessly into the image, maintaining structural coherence and visual plausibility without introducing any artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the badge is held within the hand with no visible artifacts disrupting the composition. It maintains visual coherence with the overall scene, both through placement and design. The badge's position is logical and does not introduce visual incongruities with the surrounding elements like the balloon and building. The seamless integration aligns with the animated style of the piece, ensuring structural and visual plausibility.",
