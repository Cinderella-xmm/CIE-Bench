      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the brown leather trench coat have consistent texture and natural folds that align with human body contours, and are the brass gears and mechanical details integrated without disrupting the coat's structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brown leather trench coat in Image B shows a texture consistent with real leather, featuring natural folds and wrinkles that align with the human body's contours. The brass gears and mechanical details are seamlessly integrated into the coat, enhancing its visual appeal without compromising its structure or appearance. This suggests a harmonious design where all elements are cohesively joined.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chronometer held in the right hand proportionally sized relative to the hand, with realistic shadows and reflections, and does it maintain a natural grip without distorted fingers or misplaced joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chronometer visible on the table or rail maintains good proportionality with respect to realistic hand and wrist anatomy. While not being held, it displays realistic shadows and reflections on the visible surfaces, maintaining believability in terms of its alignment and supporting placement.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the goggles positioned on the tricorne hat in a way that respects the hatâ€™s structure, with no floating parts, unnatural shadows, or clipping errors between the goggles and the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goggles seem to sit naturally on the tricorne hat in Image B with no visible floating elements or clipping issues between the goggles and the hat. The shadows cast by the goggles also appear natural, contributing to the integration into the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the airships and floating cities in the background appear at appropriate distances, with consistent lighting and atmospheric perspective, and do they not overlap or obscure the subject unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airships and floating cities in the background of Image B appear to be correctly distanced, with atmospheric perspective applied to suggest depth and distance. The lighting remains consistent with the rest of the scene, and they do not overlap or interfere with the main subject in an unnatural manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the leather coat, brass gears, and other materials free from unnatural repetition, blurring, or artificial edges, and do fine details such as stitching and rivets remain sharp and consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures in Image B, including the leather coat, brass gears, and various materials, do not exhibit unnatural repetition or blurring. The fine details, such as stitching and rivets, are sharp and consistent, ensuring the image looks realistic and well-crafted without artificial edges.",
