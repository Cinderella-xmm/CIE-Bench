      "question": "Does the marble grotto structure exhibit uniform stone-like texture and natural veining throughout, without artificial-looking smoothness or irregular patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a structure with a marbled appearance, though it appears more stylized and plastic-like due to the smoothness and uniformity. Natural marble typically has unique and varying veining patterns that add texture and depth. In this image, the surface appears overly uniform and smooth, lacking the spontaneous veining that characterizes natural marble.",

      "question": "Do the porcelain figurines retain accurate anatomical proportions and facial features without deformation, and do they display a consistent glossy finish across all surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurines in the edited image have a stylized look, with simplified forms and faceless figures, which affects their anatomical proportions and details. Porcelain figures usually have refined details and a glossy finish. Here, the finishes appear consistent in glossiness, but the lack of facial features detracts from typical anatomical accuracy.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the gold leaf details confined to garment edges and halos, applied evenly and without overlapping or smudging, and do they reflect light naturally without creating harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold leaf details on the figurines appear uniform, with the edging clearly visible on the garments and halos. The design is simple, and while reflections are soft and not harsh, the controlled application suggests that the gold detailing avoids overlap or smudging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging clearly visible surrounding the figurine set, featuring a branded exterior and dark velvet lining that supports the figures without compressing or distorting them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, there is no visible packaging surrounding the figurines. The image focuses solely on the nativity scene setup without any packaging components like branding or lining material being apparent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the columns and arches of the marble grotto properly scaled and aligned with the figurines, maintaining correct perspective and avoiding skewed angles or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grotto structure, based on the edited image, appears proportionate to the figurines. The columns and arches are aligned, maintaining the perspective relative to the figures. There is no indication of skewed elements or floating aspects within the design.",
