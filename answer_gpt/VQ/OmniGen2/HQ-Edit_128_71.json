      "question": "Does the scaled-down Statue of Liberty retain correct proportions between its head, torso, arms, and legs without any visible stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the edited image, the statue maintains the familiar proportions of the Statue of Liberty known worldwide, with no obvious distortions. The head, torso, arms, and legs appear proportional to each other. This can be deduced from the statue's iconic posture and structure, reflecting a consistent representation without stretching or compression.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green and copper hues on the statue’s surface distributed naturally with variations in tone and texture resembling real patina formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue in the edited image shows a realistic distribution of green and copper hues consistent with aged copper or bronze statues that develop a patina over time. The texture appears varied, simulating the natural oxidation process, which often results in uneven color tones and textures.",

      "question": "Is the glass lantern transparent with visible reflections and refractions, and do its edges appear smooth without jagged lines or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass lantern in the edited image exhibits transparency with visible reflections and refractions indicative of glass. Its edges are smooth, showing a polished finish without any jagged lines or noticeable digital artifacts, maintaining the realism of a high-quality glass surface.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skyline in the edited image features smooth color gradients with softly defined building silhouettes. The pastel shades transition evenly, avoiding abrupt color changes or banding, which is typical in high-quality digital art to ensure visual smoothness and coherence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ships and waves beneath the statue are proportionately scaled relative to the Statue of Liberty in the edited image. The ship sizes and wave formations appear naturally integrated, avoiding repetition or distortion, contributing to a cohesive scene reminiscent of a real-water body.",
