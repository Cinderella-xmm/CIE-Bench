      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character depicted does not have arms and hands with five fingers. Instead, it is drawn in a cartoonish, simplified style that is typical for such characters, with no individual digits visible. Cartoon shrimp characters often have appendages that suggest hands but are not anatomically accurate like human hands. The design seems intentional rather than a representation of human-like fingers. Therefore, the shrimp arm doesn't have five fingers with details like a human hand; hence, common sense dictates that this character doesn’t feature such anatomical details.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chef’s hat worn by the shrimp character is stylized and appears to be smooth, without detailed shading or texture that would suggest the presence of fabric texture or creases similar to real-world materials. The hat is simple, which is consistent with cartoon styling where such details are often minimized or abstracted. The depiction lacks realistic shadows and creases that would be expected if it were drawn with a high level of realism.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of a hand distinctly gripping a lemon slice. The lemon wedge is placed next to the shrimp character, consistent with a stylized, cartoonish environment. The depiction doesn't feature realistic hand movement or lemon texture detailing, as expected in cartoon illustrations where precision may be abstracted. Given this, there's no evidence of a detailed grip or natural lemon texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, motion lines and the depiction of herb particles are stylized, following cartoon conventions. The lines are arranged to suggest motion, but they don't strictly follow natural physics or biomechanics rules. Herb particles appear around the shrimp character, not necessarily dispersing from a singular, logical origin point in a realistic manner, similar to how seasoning might disperse in reality. Such artistic choices aim to convey a dynamic scene rather than adhere to physics-based logic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp tails are depicted in a pile that appears reasonably consistent with gravity, considering the cartoon context. While the cartoon drawing of shrimp doesn't strictly adhere to real-world physics and overlapping principles, it doesn't show suspended pieces that defy gravity blatantly. A pile is suggested through overlapping lines, consistent with how cartoons might depict clustering objects like shrimp.",

      "question": "Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in Image B are clearly legible, positioned such that they do not overlap with the key visual elements of the cartoon strip. They are rendered with consistent stroke thickness and styling, ensuring readability and maintaining the overall aesthetic of the comic panel. The deliberate placement of text avoids obstruction of important visual components, adhering to principles of effective cartoon design.",
