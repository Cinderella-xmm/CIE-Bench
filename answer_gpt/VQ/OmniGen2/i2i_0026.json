      "question": "Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is completely white and devoid of any content or detail, there's no visual information to analyze or compare. Therefore, it's impossible to assess body proportions, movements, or consistency in any frames.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a plain white image with no visible features or objects. Without any elements like a tennis racket or ball to assess, it's impossible to discuss textures, details, or artifacts in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the all-white Image B, no visual elements, including a hand or racket, are present to evaluate the position, grip, or ergonomics. Therefore, it's not possible to make an assessment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "With Image B being completely white, there is no background, colors, or visual information to assess. Thus, all details are lost, making it impossible to evaluate any preservation of clarity or detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sequence of actions from preparation to follow-through in the clean line art style visually coherent and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a blank white canvas, so there are no sequences, actions, or line art styles observable to analyze for coherence or believability.",
