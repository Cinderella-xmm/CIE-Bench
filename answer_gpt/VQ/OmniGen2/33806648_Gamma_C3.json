    {

      "question": "Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no skeletal wing-like extensions emerging from the rock arch's edges. Instead, the arch is embellished with crystalline structures on top of it. These structures appear to be distinct from the arch itself and are intended to add a fantastical element to the scene rather than blending naturally with the rock. Since the question involves a feature that is not present in the edited image, the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the crystalline growths along the archâ€™s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystalline growths are vividly blue and possess a high gloss look, emphasizing their fantastical nature and contrasting sharply with the natural textures of the rock arch. This design choice ensures the crystals stand out visually rather than blending in, thus the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glowing aura around the arch, particularly surrounding the runic symbols on the arch's face. This lighting effect is consistent, soft, and continuous without jagged edges or artifacts, emphasizing a mystical and fluid design. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runic symbols in Image B are depicted as glowing elements rather than carved into the rock. They are visually separate from the rock texture and are designed to glow uniformly, suggesting a magical feature more than representing natural erosion patterns. Therefore, the answer is No.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The radiant orb in Image B emits a bright light that is central within the arch. While it glows intensely, its influence on the ambient lighting and the soft shadows it casts on nearby surfaces appear carefully designed to correspond with realistic lighting effects, as seen from the shading and texture continuity on the rocks. Thus, the answer is Yes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surroundings of the arch, including the ground textures, appear altered to accompany the mystical design, such as stones and soil near the base that seem enhanced or designed to match the aesthetic of a fantastical scene. The natural look is changed, particularly around the arch base. Hence, the answer is No.",
