    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the ogre's body have simplified yet coherent proportions with no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoonish illustration of an ogre, which is characterized by simplified and exaggerated features typical for such styles. The proportions are coherent within the realm of cartoon exaggeration, with rounded limbs and clear definition compared to the more realistic rendering of Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the ogre’s body and clothing uniformly matte with no shiny reflections or residual skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre is illustrated with a flat, uniformly matte color typical of cartoon styles, devoid of textures or reflections, as opposed to the realistic depiction with textures and reflections seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the foam club visibly softer in edge definition, larger in scale, and held securely in the ogre’s right hand without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The club in Image B fits the cartoon style with softer edges and is directly proportionate to the ogre’s hand, ensuring it's held securely without distortion. This contrasts with Image A, where the weapon has realistic features and proportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fur-trimmed cape attached at the shoulders, extending downward without clipping into the body or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cape appears integral to the character design with clear attachment points at the shoulders and extends downward without clipping issues, which is typical for cartoon illustrations where physical logic is maintained within stylized boundaries.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the rocky base fully grounded, with the plaque clearly engraved and readable, and no floating or shadow inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocky base and engraved plaque in Image B are coherent and well-integrated into the design, serving as a platform for the ogre, free from shadow inconsistencies, unlike any irregularities that could occur in more realistically textured surfaces in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
