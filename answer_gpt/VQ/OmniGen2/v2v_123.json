      "question": "Are the edges of the chibi-style 3D models seamlessly integrated with the photorealistic background without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D models are positioned against a realistic backdrop of a tropical setting. To determine if the integration is seamless, I look for consistent lighting, shadowing, and edge blending between the characters and the background. The smooth transition without visible mismatches or artifacts suggests that the integration is seamless. The visual cues do not indicate any harsh outlines or inconsistent shadows, which strengthens the impression of a natural integration.",

      "question": "Does the glowing armor on the blonde-haired character exhibit natural light effects and detailed runes without unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I examine the glowing armor on the blonde-haired character by assessing whether the light effects and rune details appear as a coherent part of the 3D model. Natural light effects would involve a consistent glow and shadow interplay that fits the surrounding environment, while detailed runes would appear sharp and finely crafted. The armor's appearance with natural light effects and texture seems to lack any rough or unnatural features, indicating that the details are well-rendered.",

      "question": "Does the plain adventurer's clothing on the character holding the orb fit naturally on the chibi-style 3D model without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I analyze the adventurer's clothing by assessing fit and structure on the chibi-style model. Natural fit would mean that the clothing contours match the body shape, with realistic folds and no unnatural stretching or compression. The clothing appears to drape and fold in alignment with the model's shape, with no evident distortions or awkward geometrical errors.",

      "question": "Do the leather armor and floral crown on the archer appear authentic and structurally consistent with the chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I evaluate the archer's leather armor and floral crown for authenticity and structural consistency. Authentic-looking leather would display realistic texture and color, while the floral crown should maintain proportion and shape appropriate to the model. The armor and crown appear to follow the design aesthetic typical of chibi models, exhibiting appropriate textures and shapes without any visual discrepancies or inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Does the decorative border enhance the visual plausibility of the scene without disrupting its structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative border frames the scene. A border that enhances visual plausibility would integrate stylistically without drawing unnecessary attention or creating structural breaks in the composition. The border complements the overall aesthetic and remains consistent with the fantasy theme, contributing to the sceneâ€™s coherence without causing visual disruptions or distracting.",
