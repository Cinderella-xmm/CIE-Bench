      "question": "Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow kite is presented as having a diamond-shaped structure, which is a common geometric shape for kites. The edges and form appear consistent and free from any bends, creases, or any signs of distortion which might deviate from its intended shape. This observation, in line with the expected geometric precision of a typical kite structure, indicates the kite maintains its geometric shape.",

      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the yellow kite displays a smooth and consistent texture which aligns with typical materials like paper or light fabric used in kite construction. There are no patterns, reflections, or blemishes that would contradict the expected appearance of such materials. The surface seems free of any digital artifacts or unnatural textures that would indicate anything other than a typical kite material.",

      "question": "Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color of the yellow kite appears uniform across its entire surface. This consistency aligns well with expectations for a kite viewed in bright daylight, where light reflection and shadowing can cause variations. However, the kite lacks any such variance, suggesting the color consistency is quite natural against the blue sky backdrop, with no unexpected hues or discolorations present.",

      "question": "Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the kite's tail, which extends from one of the bottom corners, shows a seamless transition from the body of the kite to the tail. The tail appears intact and coherent with the rest of the kite, without any apparent breaks, abrupt changes, or inconsistencies, maintaining a smooth flow and connection with the kite body.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite string appears to have a consistent thickness and transparency expected from a lightweight string or thread typically used to fly kites. There are no visible artifacts, distortions, or unexpected changes in thickness throughout the length of the string as it connects to the kite. This depiction aligns with realistic expectations of what a kite string should look like.",
