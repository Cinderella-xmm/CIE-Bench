        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, each sticker exhibits a Chibi Ghibli cartoon style, characterized by large heads, small bodies, and exaggerated facial features. The colors in the stickers are bright and vibrant, aligning with the common aesthetic of such cartoons. There are no unnatural textures or loss of detail apparent in the stickers.

      "question": "Are the character's proportions and physical rationality preserved in all stickers, avoiding any distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all of the stickers display the Chibi style, which inherently includes exaggerated features, such as oversized heads compared to bodies. However, within this stylized context, the proportions are consistent and deliberately designed to fit the aesthetic, maintaining physical rationality in Chibi terms without any awkward distortions or unnatural shapes that diverge from the intended art style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, each sticker focuses on the character without any extraneous elements protruding or distracting from the primary design.

      "question": "Does each sticker provide a complete depiction of the character, ensuring no parts are omitted and maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In assessing Image B, all depicted characters are complete with no missing parts. Each sticker shows the entire character within the frame, maintaining coherence in structure. This completeness is essential for the effectiveness of the Chibi cartoon style, which requires full depiction to convey the character's personality and actions.",

      "question": "Is a uniform white outline consistently applied around each sticker, enhancing the sticker-like effect without disrupting the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, a uniform white outline is evident around each sticker. This design choice is commonly used to give stickers a defined boundary, enhancing their visual appeal and separation from any potential background. The outline is consistently applied and contributes to the sticker-like effect without detracting from the natural appearance of the characters.",
