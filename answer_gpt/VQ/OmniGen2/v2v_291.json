      "question": "Do the hippo and rabbit maintain their natural proportions and structural consistency in the 3D cartoon design without any visible distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo and rabbit are depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner. This means that while they retain the essence of their species, the proportions are often exaggerated or simplified. For example, the hippo's features appear more compact and rounded, and the rabbit's eyes and ears are larger and more accentuated than they would be naturally. This stylization does not maintain natural proportions but is intentionally distorted for a cartoon aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gentle lighting and cozy tones in the 3D design enhance the natural appearance of the hippo and rabbit without creating any unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and consistent, aiming to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. However, the cartoon rendering of the hippo and rabbit introduces stylized shadowing and highlights to emphasize certain features, such as the smoothness of textures and exaggerated roundness. These highlights and shadows are aesthetically pleasing but not necessarily natural, as they are tailored for a cartoon visual style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the hippo's skin texture and the rabbit's fur preserved in the 3D design without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a cartoon style which typically does not focus on realistic textures but rather on smooth surfaces and bold features to convey character traits. The hippo's skin and rabbit's fur lack realistic fine details and instead are presented with stylized smoothness. This represents a departure from realism, not preserving detailed textures seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the title banner and nameplate integrate seamlessly with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, maintaining visual credibility and not disrupting the harmony between the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner and nameplate in Image B frame the characters, creating a cohesive element typical in card designs or video games. This integration supports the cartoon style theme, maintaining a harmonious blend without disrupting the 3D aesthetic since it matches the playful, stylized nature of the hippo and rabbit.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the nature-inspired backdrop with earthy greens and rich tones blend naturally with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, avoiding any visual inconsistencies or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B complements the cartoon nature of the hippo and rabbit with its stylized lush greenery. The rich, earthy tones are consistent with the overall design, providing a seamless integration that complements the aesthetics of the cartoon design. There are no stark contrasts or textures that appear inconsistent with the characters.",
