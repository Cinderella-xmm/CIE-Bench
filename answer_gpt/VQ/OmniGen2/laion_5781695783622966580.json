    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the hat symmetrical and aligned with the brim and crown, without jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the hat appear symmetrical and are aligned with the brim and crown. The lines and shapes are sharp and smooth, which suggests meticulous design and implementation. There are no visual disruptions, such as jagged edges or broken lines, indicating high-quality workmanship. In comparison with common geometric patterns, these patterns are consistent with standard design practices, showing balance and alignment with the hat’s structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the brim follow the contour of the hat and reflect light naturally, without appearing as flat or detached patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents in Image B are designed to follow the hat’s contours seamlessly. They reflect light in a way that suggests depth and a natural placement, akin to real metallic surfaces. Unlike flat colors or added patches, these gold accents integrate with the hat, enhancing its dimensionality. Comparing this to typical material design where reflections and highlights play a role in realism, Image B adheres to these principles effectively.",

      "question": "Are the turquoise, cream, and silver motifs smoothly blended into the fabric, without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions between turquoise, cream, and silver motifs are smooth, indicative of intentional and skilled blending. The absence of pixelation or abrupt color shifts reinforces the sense of a high-resolution fabric material. In visual media, smooth gradients are typically used to represent quality finishes, and this hat meets those expectations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the hat avoid intersecting or distorting the natural wave and volume of the hair, maintaining clear separation between the two?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat’s patterns in Image B do not intrude upon or alter the hair’s natural waves and volume. There's a clear boundary maintained between the hat and the hair, allowing both elements to stand out without interference. Consistently in photography and design, maintaining clear separation between elements is critical to preserving each element’s natural structure, which is achieved here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shape of the hat’s brim and crown preserved with consistent thickness and curvature, without visible warping or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a hat with a well-defined shape where both the brim and the crown exhibit consistent thickness and curvature. There is no visible warping or deformation, suggesting a high-quality design and construction. In hat design, consistent structural integrity is crucial, which Image B successfully preserves.",
