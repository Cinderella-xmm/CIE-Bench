      "question": "Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is seated on a throne-like chair within a shadow box. The cat's body appears appropriately proportioned for a domestic feline, with no visible stretching or distortion. The limbs, head, and overall shape maintain a consistent and realistic size, suggesting adherence to natural anatomical structures. Combining this with general knowledge of cat anatomy supports the conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question pertains to Image A, and in Image B, the focus is on a different setting within a shadow box. Image B doesn't involve a settee, thus the question does not apply to the edited image, which shows a throne and velvet curtains rather than a velvet and wood settee.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet curtains are drawn partially around the area containing the cat and throne. The fold patterns are natural and correspond to how fabric typically gathers. The shadows are soft, with no harsh contrasts or misalignments, suggesting a realistic integration without signs of floating edges.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gilded columns in Image B are positioned symmetrically on either side of the throne. Their scale is proportionate to the scene, with a reflective surface that captures the light naturally. The metallic texture is consistent, without blurring or jagged edges, supporting realism in rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small portraits of mice hanging on either side of the scene. These portraits are proportional to the rest of the elements and are clearly detailed, with realistic shadows and strings attaching them to what appears to be the curtains or nearby structures. There are no visible glitches or texture errors.",
