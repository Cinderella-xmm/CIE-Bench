    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms show smooth, continuous segmentation without abrupt breaks or distorted joints, and do the glowing orbs at their ends appear naturally attached and aligned with the limb direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the cactus have been transformed into a more stylized version with glowing orbs at the ends, resembling a chandelier with crystal-like features. The arms themselves appear smoothly segmented, maintaining a continuous curvature without breakage or distortion. The glowing orbs are positioned at the ends of these arms, visually appearing as a natural extension of the limbs without misalignment or unnatural attachment points.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent scales evenly distributed across the cactus surface, following the original rib pattern without visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cactus covered in iridescent scales, providing a shimmering effect across its surface. These scales are distributed in a consistent pattern that follows the original rib structure of a cactus, showing continuity and cohesion. There are no visible seams or repetitive textures that detract from the visual appeal; colors transition smoothly and naturally without harsh or unnatural shifts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the crystal spine rise vertically from the base of the cactus with consistent facets and internal clarity, maintaining alignment with the original trunk and showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the cactus is adorned with a central, vertically rising crystal spine that emerges naturally from the base. The crystal facets exhibit internal clarity, refracting light in a consistent and realistic manner. This feature aligns properly with the overall trunk of the cactus, and there are no visible digital artifacts or clipping issues that might affect its appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent tendrils positioned along the cactusâ€™s surface in a coherent, organic pattern, with consistent thickness and spacing, and do they cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases bioluminescent features that are designed as an integral part of the cactus surface. These tendrils are arranged in an organic pattern, maintaining consistent thickness and spacing throughout. The glow emitted by these tendrils is soft and matches the direction and quality of the surrounding ambient lighting, creating a harmonious visual effect within the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the transformed cactus fully grounded in the sand, casting a shadow that aligns with the light source and does not show floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the cactus is well-rooted in the sand, exhibiting a stable grounding. The shadow cast by the cactus is appropriately aligned with the direction of the light source, ensuring that there are no visual discrepancies such as floating or disconnected sections that might otherwise suggest a lack of cohesion between the object and the environment.",
