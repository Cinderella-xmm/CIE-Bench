      "question": "Does the chibi Funko Pop-style figure maintain the structural coherence of the child's facial features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure adheres to a typical Funko Pop style, characterized by exaggerated, larger heads relative to body size with simplified and cute features. The facial features, such as the eyes and mouth, are stylized rather than realistic. This style inherently moves away from realistic proportions to embrace a playful and exaggerated aesthetic. The facial features do not appear distorted despite their difference from realistic facial structures, as the style intentionally shifts proportions for visual appeal and cuteness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tech-related accessories added to the chibi figure free of unnatural textures and integrated smoothly with the figure's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tablet held by the chibi figure appears consistent in its texture and design with the rest of the figure. It lacks any visible seams or inconsistencies and blends well with the character's modern tech-oriented theme. The accessory's texture and design mirror standard design practices observed in simplified toy models, integrating smoothly with the overall aesthetic of the figure.",

      "question": "Does the casual attire of the chibi figure retain its realistic texture and detail, avoiding any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure's attire—consisting of a casual t-shirt and jeans—appears appropriately detailed for the stylized representation. While the texture is simplified to match the aesthetic of the toy design, it maintains its fundamental shapes and colors effectively without unrealistic loss of detail. This simplification aligns with toy design conventions, managing to convey the idea of casual clothing even without intricate textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cross-legged sitting pose of the chibi figure with the tablet anatomically plausible and free of any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure exhibits an anatomically coherent sitting pose typical in stylized figures and toys. While the proportions are exaggerated according to chibi design principles, the body maintains a plausible and coherent appearance without apparent distortions. The limbs are positioned consistent with cross-legged sitting, and this anatomical stance is visually feasible within the parameters of the toy design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure outside the packaging exhibit lifelike textures and lighting, contributing to a highly detailed and visually plausible product visualization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure outside the packaging appears well-rendered, with lighting and texture application consistent with high-quality product visualization. The shadows and highlights on the figure provide depth and realism, making the visualization plausible in the context of product display. This lifelike rendering enhances the overall appeal and credibility of the toy design.",
