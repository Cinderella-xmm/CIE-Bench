      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the leather texture across the backpack's main body appear uniformly consistent in grain, color, and thickness without unnatural seams or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the backpack seems to have a smooth and consistent leather texture covering its main body. The grain, color, and thickness look uniform, and I don't detect any unnatural seams or patches that disrupt the appearance. In products like leather backpacks, an even texture is often a sign of high-quality craftsmanship. Thus, based on these visual cues and knowledge of leather goods, the texture presented seems consistently and naturally designed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the buckle surfaces altered to display a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing and realistic light reflection, without deformed shapes or mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buckles in Image B exhibit a brass-like appearance, complete with a subtle sheen and reflections typical of metal surfaces. These reflections appear natural, suggesting they were rendered realistically according to the light source in the imagery. There are no identifiable deformations in shape, and the highlights do not seem out of place. This observation is consistent with the usual presentation of polished metal surfaces, indicating a realistic depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the travel patches positioned on the side pockets with proper alignment to the stitching and fabric contours, showing no warping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I noticed no travel patches on the side pockets. The absence of such elements means there is nothing to assess for alignment or warping concerns. Thus, without travel patches present, it cannot be stated that they appear warped or misaligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" text clearly visible on the front flap, properly aligned with the flapâ€™s curvature, and free from jagged edges or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' on Image B is prominently displayed on the front flap. It follows the flap's curvature without any visible distortion, jagged edges, or ghosting effects, which is often a challenge in digital editing due to maintaining quality on curved surfaces. The clarity and alignment suggest careful placement and adjustment, making the text appear professionally integrated into the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the compass graphic near the base of the backpack rendered with fine, consistent lines that follow a circular pattern and do not distort the surrounding leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass graphic on Image B is executed with precision, showcasing consistent line work that adheres to a circular progression, suggesting a meticulous design effort. The graphic appears not to interfere with or distort the surrounding leather texture, maintaining the backpack's visual cohesiveness. Such graphics typically require precise layering and rendering to avoid altering the underlying material's look, and this graphic achieves that standard.",
