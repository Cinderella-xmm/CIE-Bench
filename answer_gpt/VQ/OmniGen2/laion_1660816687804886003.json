      "question": "Does the navy blue mesh pattern on the can maintain consistent texture density and alignment without visible warping or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The navy blue mesh pattern on Image B looks consistently dense and uniformly aligned over the shoe's surface. This indicates proper rendering in digital images, maintaining uniform density and alignment across the shoe without noticeable warping or stretching. Such patterns in digital media often require careful attention to textural detail to prevent warping or inconsistent appearance.",

      "question": "Is the brand logo clearly visible on the front of the can, correctly proportioned, and free from blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo is prominently displayed at the front of the shoe with clear text, 'Kickstart,' which is well-proportioned and does not show signs of blurring or distortion, indicating it has been rendered properly for visual clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the embossed lace textures evenly spaced and aligned around the can, without jagged edges or inconsistent depth that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laces in Image B are evenly spaced and appear straight and well-aligned. There's no noticeable jaggedness or inconsistency that would indicate digital artifacting, which often appears as rough edges or inconsistent shadows in digital images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sole stripes wrap seamlessly around the lower half of the can, maintaining their shape and spacing without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sole stripes in Image B are aligned and consistently proportioned, wrapping around the shoe without visible tearing or misalignment. In edited images, such consistency denotes careful attention to detail, avoiding common issues like warping or improper alignment during design adjustments.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red \"Kickstart\" text clearly readable, properly centered on the white area, and free from shadowing or blurring that would suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red 'Kickstart' text is clearly readable and appears centered within the white space on the shoe's tongue. There is no shadowing or blurring, indicating that the rendering process was well-executed, ensuring the text's clarity and centering, which is critical for legibility and visual appeal.",
