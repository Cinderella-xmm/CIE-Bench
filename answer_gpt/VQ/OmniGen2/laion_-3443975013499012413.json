      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the crystal facets on the fish's body follow the natural curves and scale patterns of the original wooden carving without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish is represented in a crystalline form, emphasizing transparency and light reflection. Examining the facets, the patterns on the body maintain the overall curvature seen in natural wood carvings, following along where scales would appear. Based on common world knowledge, crystal often takes angular segments for aesthetic purposes but does successfully mimic organic patterns. Image A displays a wooden carving that inherently follows natural curves due to its material composition, highlighting organic curves and textures, but without sharp angular facets characteristic of crystal. Despite the difference in material, the organic flow in the crystal maintains alignment with the original design without indicating distortion beyond artistic enhancement typical of crystalline materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy surfaces of the crystal fish uniformly reflective and free from abrupt texture changes or matte patches that break the illusion of fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal design showcases consistent glossiness enhancing its fluid appearance, inherent to polished crystal surfaces, especially under lighting that can make it look more uniform without abrupt texture changes. Based on general knowledge of crystalline objects, they exhibit high reflectivity and smoothness due to polished surfaces. In Image A, the wooden carving displays a matte finish, naturally accompanying wooden objects. Image B's crystalline material, designed to be glossy, maintains its fluidity and uniform reflection that aligns with the desired representation avoiding notable matte patches or irregular texture transitions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spiral shape of the fish preserved in the crystal version, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral shape of the crystal fish appears well-preserved, maintaining a coherent round shape that corresponds to the intended design seen in carvings. Crystalline design work often aims to retain inherent shapes for aesthetic symmetry. In Image A, the wooden carving establishes the initial spiral structure without compression or misalignment, adhering to the natural depiction of a fish coiled into a circular form. There is no visible disruption in the pattern or alignment in Image B, affirming the preservation of the spiral shape.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mirrored pedestal beneath the crystal fish reflect the sculpture accurately, with no visible distortions or missing reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal is shown to accurately reflect the crystal fish, common for mirrored surfaces which provide precise reflections due to high clarity typical of glass or polished metal. Reflections look undistorted under ideal conditions of a flat, still surface. In Image A, the wooden sculpture might employ reflective surfaces if available, but generally would not assume the same reflective quality unless purposely crafted, given wood's non-reflective nature. The mirror in Image B accurately mirrors underlying details of the crystal sculpture without noticeable distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures clearly preserved in the crystal version without fading or smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal fish displays distinct fin textures, eye sockets, and potentially gill lines. Crystalline sculptures often enhance these features for visual prominence under marble-like finishes. In Image A, the original wood carving offers precise texture lines in the wood surrounding fin features and facial details. Upon examination, Image B does present clarity in these details, despite the stone transition, retaining sharp definition synonymous with well-crafted crystal art. Therefore, the details from Image A appear well-translated and maintained in the crystal depiction.",
