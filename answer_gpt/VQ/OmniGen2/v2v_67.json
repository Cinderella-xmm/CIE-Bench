      "question": "Are the sunglasses on the horse's face free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted as a figurine within a decorative box, which inherently lacks realistic organic textures due to its illustrative nature. The focus is on a stylized representation rather than naturalism, making the sunglasses part of the artistic styling. By nature of the overall design, the sunglasses have a consistent appearance, but not in a photo-realistic context. Therefore, in comparison to a real-world photo, they are intentionally free of realistic textures or artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the horse's facial structure maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the addition of sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is presented as a figurine with a stylized facial representation, emphasizing its illustrative artistic qualities. The facial structure is simplified to match the boxed, miniature scene. The sunglasses are part of this aesthetic composition, seamlessly integrated, and do not introduce inconsistency within the figurine's structural depiction. Therefore, the visual credibility in the context of a stylized model is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the horse's fur texture and details preserved without any loss or unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B, a figurine-style artistic representation, indicates inherently simplified textures, like those expected in an illustrative scene rather than realistic fur, focusing on overall form rather than details. Given this context, the figurine's portrayal does not require real fur textures, maintaining consistent design standards throughout, including areas involving the sunglasses.",

      "question": "Do the sunglasses' material and reflections appear realistic and consistent with the lighting conditions of the sunset scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a sunset scene in a stylized format, with colors and props focused on narrative impression rather than photographic realism. The sunglasses adhere to this style, with neither realistic reflections nor material properties meant to mirror what real-world lighting would affect through a lens. The visual consistency is with artistic intent rather than realistic light interactions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse's eyes visible and undistorted under the sunglasses, preserving their natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design involves an artistic fantasy interpretation where the horse's eyes and face are elements of simplified representation, lacking the realistic expressive features seen in a real horse. Thus, sunglasses cover eyes consistent with the design logic of the figurine rather than anatomical realism, meeting style expectations rather than natural positioning.",
