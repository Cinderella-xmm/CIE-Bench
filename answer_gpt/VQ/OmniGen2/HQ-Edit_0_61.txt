    "Question": "Q1: Does the table appear transformed into a tea box lid with consistent geometry and engraved leaf patterns that follow natural contours without warping or breaking the surface structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table has been replaced with what resembles a tea box lid. The lid has a rectangular, box-like appearance that is consistent with the geometry expected of a lid. The engraved patterns are clearly visible and follow a natural contour consistent with the design, without any visible warping or structural breaking. The changes suggest a deliberate transformation with high attention to detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the replaced cups depicted with clear, detailed sustainable material textures (such as fibrous or layered patterns) that appear natural and integrated into the scene without visible artifacts or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cups appear to be designed with a focus on texture and detail. They seem to have intricate fibrous or layered patterns that resemble sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled composites. These textures appear integrated into the scene seamlessly, without apparent artifacts or blurring that would suggest editing issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the tag with the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the sceneâ€™s aesthetic, and seamlessly integrated with proper lighting and shadow alignment to avoid appearing pasted on?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tag displaying 'Zen Autumn Tea' is prominently shown. The text is clear and legible, matching the overall aesthetic style of the scene which emphasizes earthy tones and natural designs. The lighting and shadow alignment is consistent, contributing to a seamless integration into the image without conveying a pasted-on effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the teapot reshaped into a leaf contour with smooth, continuous edges and natural-looking earthy textures that do not show distortion, clipping, or unnatural color gradients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is not reshaped into a leaf contour. Instead, it retains a traditional teapot shape with intricate design elements but does not exhibit features like leaf contours or earthy textures usually associated with organic form redesigns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements (tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, leaf-shaped teapot) align with the original lighting direction and cast consistent shadows, maintaining spatial harmony and depth without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "Image B has edited elements such as the tea box lid, sustainable cups, and brand tag, all of which show consistency with the lighting direction and shadow casting evident in their spatial harmony. These elements do not exhibit any signs of floating or misalignment, preserving the depth and cohesion of the scene. However, the teapot is not leaf-shaped.",
    "answer": "Yes"
