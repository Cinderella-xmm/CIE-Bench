    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior appears to have natural limb proportions and body structure. The arms and legs are proportionate to the torso, and there are no visible signs of distorted joints or exaggerated features. This reflects a realistic portrayal, consistent with typical 3D modeling practices for humanoid figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
    "explanation": "The armor in Image B exhibits reflections and varying shades of blue, suggesting depth and contour. These characteristics indicate that the rendering includes natural light reflections, contributing to a more lifelike and dynamic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trident is grasped firmly in the hand, and its size appears suitable relative to the warrior's figure. There is no visible bending or truncation, suggesting a correct and natural positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
    "explanation": "The dome in Image B has a smooth and continuous curvature, maintaining consistent transparency throughout. There are no visible seams, distortions, or anomalies, indicating high-quality rendering of the enclosure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
    "explanation": "The coral reef base in Image B exhibits textured patterns that mimic natural corals. It is proportionately scaled to support the figure, neither appearing too small nor overwhelmingly large, leading to a balanced composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean currents around the model appear to have a continuous and directional flow, maintaining fluidity without any abrupt interruptions or disjointed segments. This contributes to a cohesive underwater scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "The hand in Image B holding the trident is observed to have five fingers. The joint angles and grip seem natural, with no extra digits or awkward bends present, ensuring anatomical correctness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all elements, including the model, dome, base, and currents, are aligned and layered correctly. The elements are cohesively integrated without any floating or disconnected appearances, maintaining a harmonious and logical composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
