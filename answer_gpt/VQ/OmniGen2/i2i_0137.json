      "question": "Does the teapot appear naturally integrated into the scene, maintaining texture and lighting similar to the surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B appears to be made from a ceramic or porcelain material, which is consistent with the traditional style seen in such home settings. The lighting on the teapot mirrors the lighting angle observed through the window, reflected on the chairs and the plants. This integration of light and shadow allows it to appear naturally blended into the scene with the surrounding objects, suggesting it maintains a similar texture and lighting.",

      "question": "Are the two porcelain cups visually coherent with the setting, showing natural porcelain material and appropriate shadows on the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The porcelain cups in Image B exhibit a surface texture that is indicative of porcelain material, with a glossy finish that reflects the lighting in the room. The shadows cast by the cups onto the table are consistent with the lighting direction of the scene, contributing to their visual coherence with the setting. This alignment of material appearance and shadow play makes them blend well into the room's environment.",

      "question": "Do the new additions (teapot and porcelain cups) fit naturally within the room's ambiance without causing any visible distortions or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of the teapot and porcelain cups is in harmony with the overall room aesthetic, complementing the color scheme and style. The items do not create any visible distortions in the scene, such as incorrect lighting, shadow inconsistencies, or disproportionate sizes relative to other objects, ensuring their seamless integration into the room's ambiance.",

      "question": "Are the teapot and porcelain cups appropriately sized and positioned on the table, maintaining proper proportions and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot and cups in Image B are appropriately scaled relative to the table and chairs. Their position on the table is logical and balanced, ensuring structural consistency within the viewing frame. They neither overwhelm the visual space nor are they too diminutive compared to the surrounding objects, maintaining a proportional relationship that is expected in such setups.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the teapot and porcelain cups retain detailed textures and edges, ensuring they stand out clearly against the background without losing definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot and cups retain clarity and detail, with visible texture representative of their material. Their edges are well-defined, contrasting sufficiently against the backdrop and the tabletop, preventing any loss of definition which could create a blurred or indistinct portrayal. The use of shadow and highlights further aids their standout appearance within the scene.",
