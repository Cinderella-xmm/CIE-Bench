    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the armor-like rock sections maintain visible sedimentary layering and natural erosion contours consistent with the surrounding cliff face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor-like formations integrated into the cliff appear to be designed in a highly stylized manner, deviating from natural sedimentary layering. They have smooth, sculpted surfaces with detailed embellishments that don't reflect typical geological formations caused by erosion or sedimentation, unlike the natural cliff face in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moss growth confined to shaded or moist areas of the rock armor and does it show natural variation in density and color rather than uniform application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss growth on the rock armor in Image B appears strategically placed to highlight the sculpted contours of the armor, showing a natural-looking variation in density and color, which mimics growth confined to suitable shaded and moist areas. This suggests an intentional replication of natural growth patterns due to environmental conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the spectral limbs originate from the cliff base and merge with the sea surface in a way that preserves water-level continuity and avoids floating or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spectral limbs seemingly flow naturally from the cliff base into the sea, with water effects designed to give an appearance of continuity between land and sea levels, avoiding any appearance of floating or detachment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees forming the mane spaced irregularly and angled naturally along the cliff edge, consistent with wind exposure and terrain slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees on Image B are positioned in a manner that suggests natural spacing and varying angles, consistent with how trees might grow on a windswept slope or rugged terrain, adding to the environmental realism of the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the runes follow natural rock fissures and exhibit soft edges with shadowing that matches ambient lighting, rather than appearing as crisp, untextured overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runes in Image B are carved into the rock in a way that aligns with natural formations and crevices. They exhibit shadowing consistent with ambient lighting and have a soft texture, blending realistically with the rock surface rather than appearing as artificial overlays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the spiraling spirits emit or absorb light in a way that matches the sun's position and create subtle volume effects consistent with mist or vapor, without sharp edges or unnatural opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spiraling spirits in Image B appear to glow softly, reflecting light properties consistent with the sun's position during sunrise or sunset. They possess a vapor-like volume, avoiding sharp edges and maintaining a natural translucency, integrating seamlessly into the scene.",
