    "Question": "Q1: Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish displays a smooth, translucent surface. The edges of the bell appear well-rounded without any sharp lines or visible seams, which aligns with a realistic depiction of a jellyfish. There are no noticeable texture irregularities or patches that would typically appear unnatural in such a context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
    "explanation": "The tendrils in Image B appear smooth and exhibit a natural curvature, typical of a jellyfish's flowing and flexible extensions. They are shown with an iridescent quality, capturing light in a gradient of colors. There are no noticeable angular distortions or segmented appearances, which further supports the natural representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "Inside the bell of the jellyfish in Image B, the glowing patterns are designed to look like natural bioluminescence found in marine life. These patterns are swirling and fluid, exhibiting a dynamic yet natural glow. There isnâ€™t a presence of repetitive geometric shapes or jagged edges, which would otherwise suggest an artificial design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
    "explanation": "The glowing nodules on the tendrils of the jellyfish in Image B are softly illuminated, with a gradual spread of light emanating from each point. Their arrangement does not follow a strict pattern; rather, they are scattered in a non-uniform manner, which mimics a natural placement as one might expect in a biological organism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases ambient lighting that is diffused and predominantly tinted with shades of blue and green, which are characteristic of underwater scenes. The presence of faint water particles and depth cues around the jellyfish adds to the realism and consistency with an underwater setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the connection point where the jellyfish is attached to the ceiling is visually seamless and continuous. There are no floating segments or interruptions in the structure, which helps maintain the integrity and realism of the image as a hanging object in a consistent environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
