      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall is depicted in a highly stylized manner using bright blue light, suggesting a digital projection rather than natural water flow. It conveys a smooth and consistent texture, with well-defined flow lines illuminated with consistent lighting. The coherent appearance without pixelation or distorted shapes indicates a uniform digital creation. Common sense tells us that digital representations often aim for smoothness in their visual textures and this appears consistent here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks and vines show iridescent, glowing colors resembling fiber-optic cables. They twist in a smooth, continuous manner around the tree trunks, maintaining natural branch contours, which avoids breaking the geometric continuity. This consistent glow shows no signs of patchiness, which reflects a coherent design often expected in digital or stylized art. This observation derives from understanding digital art techniques that aim for clear and evenly distributed lighting effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital trees and vines form spirals that wrap around the trunks with visual coherence. They create fluid loops consistent with their fiber-optic representation, implying the intended illusion of self-supporting and continuous forms similar to artistic sculptures. There are no disconnected or floating segments visible. This judgment comes from recognizing the digital art's emphasis on fluid form and consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setting is clearly fabricated with glowing trees and waterfalls without a natural mountain backdrop, focusing on a uniform lighting scheme. The background does not present mountains; instead, it is a fabricated digital space, likely artificially constructed to house these vibrant elements. The continuity is evident as everything seems to be a part of a cohesive artificial environment, avoiding mismatched lighting which is typical in consistent digital art applications.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, rather than natural elements like river stones or foliage, there are digitally stylized plants and surfaces surrounding the glowing trees. The textures, while smooth and fitting with the digital theme, do not depict detailed natural features but rather favor stylized smoothness. Digital design often opts for simple, smooth textures to maintain continuity, thus sharp detail is purposely absent, focusing on glowing effects over intricate natural texture.",
