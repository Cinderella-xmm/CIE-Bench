      "question": "Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is portrayed in a cartoonish style. Cartoon depictions often simplify or exaggerate proportions, yet they still maintain a coherent structure that is easily recognizable. The truck in Image B, despite having exaggerated and bold outlines, retains the fundamental structure of a semi-truck with no broken or heavily distorted parts. Its cab, grille, and wheels are intact and proportionally consistent with a stylized artistic approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B intentionally lacks the realistic texture seen in Image A because it is drawn in a cartoon style. In this style, details such as reflections on surfaces, rubber textures on wheels, and metal textures on the grille are often smoothed out and simplified to suit the illustration's design. There are no unnatural artifacts in the context of this style, as the artistic intention is to depict the truck with large, clean surfaces.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's vibrant red color against the simplified green and blue background appears intentional and thematic for a cartoon image. The color balance and brightness are consistent with what one would expect in a flat-styled cartoon image, where bright primary colors are commonly used. Therefore, despite being simplified, there are no unrealistic contrasts or inconsistencies within the cartoon context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is composed of stylized trees and clouds that parallel the cartoon style of the truck. This integration creates a cohesive image where the truck appears to belong naturally within its illustrated environment. The shapes and colors are consistent and do not distract from the main subject but complement it, preserving the scene's authenticity within its cartoon context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the simplified style, the wheels are depicted as structurally sound with no distortion. They maintain a logical alignment with the body of the truck, and their circular shape, despite being less detailed, is consistent with how wheels are typically represented in cartoons. This preserves the visual credibility of the truck within the context of its artistic style.",
