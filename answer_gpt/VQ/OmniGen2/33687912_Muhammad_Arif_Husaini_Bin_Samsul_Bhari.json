    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shell-like body of the creature have consistent curvature and smooth surface transitions without visible cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell-like structure at the center is large and prominently features a smooth, consistent curvature, similar to that of a seashell, with a glowing light emanating from the inside. There are no visible cracks or misaligned segments, and the surface transitions smoothly without any distortion. This design element is likely intended to appear harmonious and seamless, providing an aesthetically pleasing shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the coral-like spires distributed organically along the back of the creature, with varying heights and irregular shapes that resemble natural coral formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are multiple spire-like extensions protruding from the shell-like body. These spires vary in height and have irregular, jagged forms that could resemble natural coral formations, giving an organic and natural aesthetic that contrasts with the smoothness of the shell body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing sea guardian spirits emit soft, diffused light that originates from their bodies and does not produce sharp halos or isolated bright spots outside their forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a glow that emanates from the shell-like structure, particularly from its spires and body. This light is soft and diffused, likely designed to provide a gentle, harmonious illumination without creating sharp halos or isolated intense bright spots. The light appears to integrate into the overall ambiance, maintaining a magical yet subtle visual effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flow smoothly in the same direction as the original wake, with colors transitioning gradually from warm orange to deep red matching the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the wave pattern that appears behind the enhanced shell-like structure glows in a manner consistent with the warm colors of the sunset, transitioning gradually. However, given the presence of the new structure, this modified pattern does not precisely reflect the original wake's direction or style in Image A, where the waves follow the movement of a boat, rather than flowing naturally in the colors of the sky.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature cast a faint shadow on the water surface beneath it, and are its illuminated parts consistent with the direction of sunlight from the setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell-like structure identifies a luminescent body that appears to cast a soft glow rather than distinct shadows. There is no clear shadow exhibited on the water surface, which would be expected if consistent with sunlight direction. Instead, the light seems to emit uniformly around the structure rather than emphasizing the setting sun's directional illumination.",
