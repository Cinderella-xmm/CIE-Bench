    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the robes depicted with consistent indigo and gold patterns that follow the contours of the original drapery without visible seams or unnatural texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robes display indigo and gold patterns that flow smoothly and naturally along the contours of the drapery, as expected in a traditional depiction that emphasizes fluid motion akin to fabric or waves. The patterns seem consistent and don't exhibit any visible seams or abrupt texture breaks that would disrupt the fluidity. This assessment relies on recognizing the common representation of waves in art and textile designs, aiming for uninterrupted, flowing patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms feature calligraphic lines that follow the natural curvature of the limbs without distorting the hands or creating more than five fingers per hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B are adorned with calligraphic lines that elegantly highlight the natural curvature from shoulder to fingertips. This type of line work is common in stylized art to emphasize form and flow without distorting the natural anatomy, which includes maintaining five fingers per hand. The lines complement rather than disrupt the depiction of the limbs, preserving anatomical accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the face composed of clean, continuous outlines that preserve the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth without exaggerated or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the blurred face is not considered, focusing on what's visible, the approach to outlining features would follow the context. In similar stylized representations, clean, continuous outlines are typically employed to maintain the integrity of facial features. Based on surrounding elements, the outlines aim for smooth continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wave-like clouds in the background smoothly blended with the statue's silhouette, without sharp boundaries or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave-like clouds are seamlessly integrated with the silhouette of the statue, mimicking traditional artistic techniques where backgrounds and figures meld smoothly. This creates a harmonious composition without sharp boundaries that would disturb the aesthetic flow, demonstrating a style where elements complement rather than compete with each other.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the statue's posture stable, with arms symmetrically extended and the head centered above the torso, showing no signs of misalignment or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the figure in a stable posture with arms symmetrically extended, maintaining a balanced composition. The head remains centered above the torso, a critical aspect for depicting stability in art. This is consistent with traditional symmetric depictions of such figures aimed at stability and grace.",
