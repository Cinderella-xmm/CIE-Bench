    "Question": "Q1: Are the black ink outlines around the car's body, wheels, and wing consistently sharp and aligned with the underlying shapes without breaking or overlapping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car is illustrated with bold black outlines typical of a comic style. I observe that the lines around the car's body, wheels, and wing maintain consistency in sharpness, and each stroke adheres closely to the outlines of the shapes without breaks or overlaps. This harmonious alignment enhances the cartoonish representation, which is common in comic illustrations.",

Here, the car predominantly features muted orange, cream, and deep gray tones.

    "Question": "Q6: Has the background behind the car been simplified into flat or textured blocks without retaining detailed figures or structures that conflict with the comic style?",

The complex details seen in Image A have been abstracted into flat colors and simple textures, removing intricate details that would typically conflict with the simplified aesthetic of a comic-style representation.",

    "Question": "Q7: Are the car’s wheels properly aligned with the axles, and do the suspension arms maintain correct angles and connections without bending or stretching?",
    "explanation": "Within Image B, although stylized for comic effect, the car’s wheels appear to be properly aligned with the axles. The suspension arms, though simplified, maintain logically correct angles. There is no evident bending or stretching that would disrupt the mechanical function or visual integrity of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are the sponsor logos on the car’s wing and body still recognizable and legible despite the comic-style treatment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, due to the comic treatment, sponsor logos are simplified and none are distinctly legible; they are abstracted into basic shapes and lines. The intention is more stylistic rather than focusing on logo legibility, commonly seen in illustratively stylized work.",
    "answer": "No"
