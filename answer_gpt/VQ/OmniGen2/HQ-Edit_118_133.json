      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the teapot’s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface exhibits a metallic finish with intricate engravings and textures, distinct from a high-gloss ceramic surface known for being smooth and largely without noticeable texture. The elaborate design and metal-like sheen are visible, indicating that the teapot retains its original metallic character rather than changing to a ceramic finish. Thus, the analysis shows texture artifacts typical of metal engraving.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wick positioned at the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical orientation that aligns naturally with the candle design, without bending or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wick is not positioned at the location associated with the spout nor exhibits a straight vertical orientation appropriate for a candle. Instead, the teapot does not have any wick visible at the spout region, as it retains the form and design typical of a teapot. Reasoning suggests aligning with common candle design practices, the wick would fit within the candle image’s context, not visible here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle retains a wooden look with metal fixtures rather than converting to a solid gold finish. The visual cues include wood grain and metallic attachments, maintaining original curvature and design details rather than transitioning to gold. This consistency supports identifying the unchanged material attributes and structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns around the base of the teapot evenly spaced, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with the existing engraved motifs, without overlapping or distorting the base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible floral patterns around the teapot base. The etched metallic design itself includes intricate and ornamental motifs characteristic of metal engraving, but no distinct floral patterns disrupting proportions or overlaying the base structure. The motifs observed are consistent with the teapot’s overall style.",

      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" placed centrally on the front face of the teapot in a flowing script font that matches the luxury theme, with no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts?",
