      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy still clearly visible as a circular object centered within the intended eye area, with white foamy textures extending outward like lashes without breaking the circle's outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange lifebuoy is transformed into an eye-like feature on a large animal figure. The orange part serves as the eye with added details such as lashes. The foamy textures extend outward to mimic lashes but the transformation has altered the overall appearance. While there are textures suggesting lashes, the original circular outline is no longer centered or singularly represented, indicating that the visual representation has changed from Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the netting sections along the shoreline transformed into soft, undulating fin shapes with gradual transitions from mesh to organic form, lacking sharp angles or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fins on the figure have a smooth, rounded appearance which fits the description of being undulating. The image depicts these fins with a gradual transition from the mesh-like netting without visible sharp angles or pixelated edges. This indicates a careful transformation from the netting in Image A to an organic-looking form in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline curve smoothly into a continuous, rounded body shape with wave-like ridges embedded in the sand, without sudden kinks or flat regions disrupting the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the shoreline curving smoothly into the body of the transformed figure, resembling a continuous and rounded shape. The appearance of the body is fluid and organic, lacking any sudden kinks or flat regions. The transformation from the straight shoreline in Image A to the rounded form in Image B reflects a deliberate, smooth metamorphosis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sea-green markings distributed evenly across the sandy surface with soft, diffused edges and no visible pixels, overlays, or repeating patterns that suggest artificial addition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea-green markings are integrated into the body of the transformed figure. They appear as part of the skin texture and are depicted with diffused edges, blending naturally with the surrounding surface. There are no visible pixels or patterns that suggest they are artificially added, which indicates careful and even distribution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eye (lifebuoy), fins (netting), and body (shoreline) align in a way that suggests a single, cohesive organism with logical proportions and no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transformed figure where the eye, fins, and body are proportionally aligned to form a cohesive organism. The elements are seamlessly integrated without any floating or misaligned components. The visual transitions between these parts appear logical within the context of a singular creature, which helps maintain a sense of coherence.",
