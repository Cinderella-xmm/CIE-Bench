      "question": "Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's muscles are exaggerated, which is a common artistic choice in stylized or comic illustrations to emphasize strength and athleticism. Despite exaggeration, the anatomy maintains plausible proportions without unnatural bulges or warped geometry, leading to an artistic style consistent with the theme.",

    {

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does it grip the ball in a physically credible manner?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's hand gripping the basketball is stylized to fit within comic or anime-like illustrations with exaggerated lines but retains five discernible fingers.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a blank text area designed in a graffiti style, with clear visibility and consistency in its artistic approach. It integrates well within the existing background theme, offering a cohesive layer without distorting or obscuring central scene elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts stylized lighting and shadows, adjusted to fit the comic-like representation. While exaggerated, these elements convey consistency in the illustration, maintaining coherence despite non-realistic proportions and ensuring the absence of visual artifacts like mismatched highlights.",
