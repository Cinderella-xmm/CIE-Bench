    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs are crafted to be smooth and elongated in a stylized manner, which is typical for a figurine with metallic and artistic design. The absence of kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments in the limbs is confirmed by the seamless flow of the sculpture’s metallic surface, suggesting that they maintain proportionality and coherence expected in a stylized art piece like this.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays geometric and floral designs on the boots, executed with precision and clean edges. The designs are symmetrical and stylistically fit within the constraints of a uniform metallic figure. This suggests a careful and uniform application without signs of overlap or fragmentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire figure, including skin, dress, and boots, presents a consistent metallic sheen. The surface displays smooth gradients and transitions, showcasing the typical characteristics of a fabricated metallic figurine, with no patches or irregularities in material visible. This consistency confirms the uniform application of the metallic effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
    "explanation": "The examination of Image B reveals a color palette mainly consisting of metallic gold and turquoise, without any indications of color bleed or desaturation affecting the integrity of the figurine or the background. This controlled palette enhances the artistic and cohesive look of the sculpture within its design scope.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
    "explanation": "The pose in Image B is reminiscent of a dynamic and balanced sculpture. The weight distribution appears intentional and supports the character’s stance without unnatural overlap or floating. Although stylized, the joints and limb angles seem coherent, maintaining a harmonious balance typical for posed sculptures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the extended hand exhibits five fingers, captured with natural spacing and curvature suitable for a stylized sculpture. There are no signs of extra digits or fused joints, indicating that the design adheres to a natural but artistically enhanced structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
