      "question": "Does the crack on the Axe container appear natural and maintain the structural integrity of the container without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there’s a visible crack on the top of the container. Given its presence, combined with the knowledge that cosmetic containers are typically designed to be intact, a crack would not be considered natural as it would compromise the structural integrity of the container. Typically, cracks in such materials also tend to create visible artifacts rather than maintaining a smooth appearance due to the rigid nature of plastic materials.",

      "question": "Does the miniature nebula inside the container blend naturally with the interior of the container and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the container’s top shows a colorful nebula instead of what would be expected inside—a homogenous inner surface matching the container’s design theme. The nebula, visually juxtaposed with the container's typical appearance, suggests a fantastical rather than a plausible scenario. Containers designed for cosmetics like putty don’t generally contain such elaborate, space-themed designs internally, leading to the conclusion that this isn’t a natural blend.",

      "question": "Are the cosmic dust and gases within the nebula detailed and textured, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nebula introduces cosmic dust and gases with a smooth texture and rich details rendered without visible pixelation or artifacts. Such artistic depiction signifies an intentional design rather than a natural occurrence but respects artistic rendering choices by avoiding pixelation and maintaining visual integrity throughout.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the size and shape of the nebula fit naturally within the container's opening, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original design of a container for putty dictates a consistent interior structure without variant shapes or fantastical representations like a nebula. Image B shows the nebula extending over the top, seemingly replacing where the putty would be, contrasting with expectations and indicating it doesn’t fit naturally within the container's practical design. Typical commercial containers have utilitarian openings that don't accommodate such large imagery without altering form or function.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues in the nebula consistent with the label design and contribute to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebula in Image B features fiery red and energetic pink hues that visually echo the energetic theme seen within the label design, creating a plausible aesthetic connection. Despite the appropriateness of color matching, the nebula itself remains an imaginative insertion rather than naturally part of the container's functional design.",
