      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain proper structural consistency, with the head being slightly oversized yet naturally proportioned to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible chibi character present. This image is completely white with no features or objects to analyze. Based on the lack of visual content in Image B, there is no evidence to suggest the presence of a chibi character with a specific head-to-body ratio.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gray T-shirt and shorts of the chibi character accurately and naturally represented, without introducing any unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that it is entirely blank and devoid of any discernible features, including a chibi character or clothing elements such as a T-shirt and shorts. The absence of any visual content means there can be no judgment regarding the representation or texture quality of nonexistent clothing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cartoonified skateboard retain its visual plausibility with no unnatural textures or loss of fine details that would disrupt the scene’s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "With Image B being entirely white, there are no visual elements, including a skateboard, to evaluate for visual plausibility or detail preservation. The lack of any skateboard image negates the possibility of making an assessment regarding its cartoonification and related quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the new hand-drawn city skyline background coherent and visually plausible, contributing positively to the overall scene without disrupting the main character’s prominence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays no city skyline or any background elements as it is uniformly white throughout. Without any visible background content in Image B, there is no basis for determining coherence, visual plausibility, or contribution to the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit overall authenticity and natural appearance, with no obvious artifacts or distortions introduced during the stylization process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is completely devoid of any distinguishable features, and is essentially a blank white image, there are no elements to evaluate for authenticity, natural appearance or any distortions/artifacts from a stylization process. Therefore, it cannot be considered an authentic or natural representation.",
