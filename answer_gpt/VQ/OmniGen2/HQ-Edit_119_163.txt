    "Question": "Q1: Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical body is actually the same shape as the original teapot from Image A, maintaining a spherical form rather than cylindrical. The dragon engravings appear similar in design and distribution as in Image A, suggesting continuity and no distortion. This indicates that the proportion is consistent in both images, as both are more spherical than cylindrical.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the screw cap on top of the canister appears to be part of a seamlessly integrated lid similar to Image A. Both feature consistent metallic textures and sheen, with detailed embossing visible, but there's no visible differentiation in Image B indicating a screw cap versus the solid lid seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Dragon's Delight' aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spout features no visible text. It aligns with traditional design elements related to craftsmanship, where text on functional elements like spouts is rare; common sense dictates that the surface remains clean for aesthetic purposes without any distortion images from added features.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the cap does not feature a tea leaf logo; it retains the original decorative element with a textured and embossed design as seen in Image A. The absence of a logo suggests that the cap remains uniform without any added logos disrupting its surface characteristics.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the container retains its spherical form like Image A, without altering to a cylindrical shape which implies any conversion. The dragon engravings remain intact and evenly distributed, without visible signs of deformation or warping indicative of a stable and coherent surface structure.",
    "answer": "No"
