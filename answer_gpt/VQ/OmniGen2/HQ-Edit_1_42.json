    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cartoon version of the man have correctly proportioned limbs, five fingers per hand, and natural joint angles without bending or elongation errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted in a stylized manner typical for cartoons, which often simplifies proportions and features. However, the limbs appear to be correctly proportioned relative to his body size with natural joint angles, and each hand distinctly shows five fingers which are appropriately shaped for the style. This reflects an understanding of human anatomy despite the stylized design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the swirling leaves positioned in a way that follows logical airflow paths and do not intersect or pass through the man’s body or bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves are artistically arranged around the figure in a way that suggests movement but do not intersect with the man's body, which maintains the illusion of swirling without physical interaction. This layout demonstrates a comprehension of airflow paths even in a cartoon setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree canopies and foliage display consistent color distribution and intact branching structures without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simplifies real-life elements into a cartoon style, where foliage and canopies are represented by individual leaves. These leaves are distributed evenly across the man's figure, maintaining consistent color and placement relative to the design without breakage or misalignment. However, actual tree structures as seen in realistic images might not be present, yet the stylistic choice remains consistent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cream-colored paper background uniformly textured and do the tree branch motifs lie flat without distortion, clipping, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is cream-colored, exhibiting a consistent texture appropriate for a flat illustration style. There are no indications of distortion or clipping in the cartooned motif of leaves against this background. Shadows that might highlight textural irregularities are absent, indicative of stylistic choices for illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the elements (man, leaves, bench, paper border) arranged within clear margins and aligned symmetrically or logically to suggest a bounded page layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B organizes its components harmoniously, following balanced design principles typical of illustration and cartoon art. Elements aren’t crowding each other which allows for a central focus typical of page layouts, suggesting intended design choices instead of arbitrary placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all surfaces (clothing, skin, leaves, paper) rendered with consistent sharpness and texture detail without jagged lines, smudging, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, surfaces are drawn cleanly as per the stylized manner typical in cartoons, retaining clarity and sharpness in details like the outlines of clothing, leaves, and paper. Although some detail level differs from realism, it maintains uniformity and avoids visible errors in smudging or smoothing.",
