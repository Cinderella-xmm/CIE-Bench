    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the watch communicator on the plaid tie positioned naturally within the fabric, with consistent color, texture, and lighting that match the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch communicator is depicted as an object held by the character rather than being part of the plaid tie. It is designed as a separate gadget distinct from the fabric texture and color of the tie. Thus, it is not integrated into the fabric, nor does it blend in with its texture and lighting. This suggests that the communicator is intentionally a separate element, not integrated into the tie.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camera lens embedded in the emblem on the right suit’s lapel aligned with the pattern and fabric, showing no gaps, misaligned edges, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible emblem or camera lens depicted on the right suit's lapel. The characters are cartoon representations and do not show fabric details or concentrated objects like camera lenses. Since there is no such element to evaluate, it cannot be aligned with any fabric pattern or texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles and dialogue text clearly separated from the characters’ faces and clothing, with clean lines and no overlap or distortion of nearby features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubbles and dialogue text are clearly separated from the characters' faces and clothing. The bubbles have clean and smooth outlines and remain distinct from the characters, leaving a clear space between them and the characters’ features. This design ensures no overlap or distortion occurs in nearby features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the characters’ necks and shoulders retain natural proportions and smooth contours, without stretched, compressed, or fragmented shapes after anthropomorphization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon characters have simplified and stylized characteristics typical of comic style, but their necks and shoulders maintain smooth contours and are proportional within the cartoon's context. The shapes do not appear overly stretched, compressed, or fragmented, and they align with typical stylized comic designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grassy field and sky background free from distortion, noise, or color inconsistencies that suggest digital manipulation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy field and sky background appear to be digitally illustrated instead of photographic like Image A. The colors are vivid and consistent typical of digital art. Digital illustrations often lack noise or photographic distortions unless intentionally added, shedding no signs of manipulation or detail loss from this context.",
