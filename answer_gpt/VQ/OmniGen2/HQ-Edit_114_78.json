      "question": "Does the key maintain its original geometric shape and proportions when transformed into a bridge, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key in the foreground serves as a decorative element connected to a wooden case. There is no visible transformation of the key into a bridge. Instead, the bridge is a distinct miniature element within the diorama set inside the case. The key retains its metallic appearance and structure separate from the bridge, hence no warping or stretching is evident related to this context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny houses and trees positioned in a way that aligns with the wood grain’s depth and surface plane, without floating or appearing disconnected from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the miniature houses and trees are meticulously placed within the carved setting of the wooden case. They seem to be sitting on various terraced layers designed to emulate mountainous terrain. The arrangement appears well thought-out to correspond with the natural shifts in texture, suggesting a connection rather than disconnection. There are no visual cues of floating or misalignment with the overall design.",

      "question": "Does the resin river emerge smoothly from the key’s bit and flow with consistent material properties, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the resin river flows from a gap within the miniature landscape on the carved hill. It features a consistent coloration and smooth progression from its source down the landscape. Also, there aren't any disruptions or breaks noted visually in the flow of the river, indicating a consistent design and material integrity throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boundary of the key case clearly defined and consistent with the wood grain and metallic tones of the key, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boundary of the key case in Image B is well-defined, with distinctive wood tones that provide a rich, consistent texture across the entire surface. This texture aligns with the metallic sheen of the key, maintaining uniform lighting without abrupt changes, showcasing a seamless and cohesive design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carved wooden hill seamlessly blended into the surrounding wood grain, with consistent texture and shading that suggests natural carving rather than digital patching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carved hill in Image B appears to integrate smoothly into the background of the key case. The shading and texture of the hill match the surrounding area, simulating a natural wood carving. There are no visible discrepancies or unwarranted changes that indicate digital alteration, supporting a perception of uniform continuity in design.",
