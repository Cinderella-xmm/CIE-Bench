      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style figure appear to seamlessly emerge from the kayak without any visible breaks or unnatural intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a 3D chibi-style figure sitting in the kayak. The integration seems smooth and natural with the pose of the figure fitting appropriately within the kayakâ€™s seating area. There is no visible separation or unnatural intersection observed where the figure interacts with the kayak, suggesting that the figure is properly rendered to appear as part of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts present around the edges where the chibi figure meets the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edges where the chibi figure contacts the kayak, the image appears clean without any glitches, awkward textures, or visible artifacts. The rendering seems professionally done, with the figure's form seamlessly transitioning into the kayak.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the chibi figure relative to the kayak appear realistic and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In a chibi-style design, figures are often stylized with larger heads and smaller bodies, which is evident in this image. Despite this exaggerated form, the figure is proportionate to the kayak and maintains consistency with typical chibi designs, which do not strive for realistic proportions but are consistent in their stylization.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph holding the scene appear naturally integrated into the overall composition without any distortion or unnatural placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Polaroid photograph holding the image of the chibi figure kayaking is well-integrated into the scene. The positioning, lighting, and dimensions of the hand, fingers, and Polaroid frame appear harmonious and undistorted, suggesting a natural and realistic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the materials and textures of the kayak and skateboard remained consistent and undistorted after the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining both images, the textures and materials of the kayak remain consistent and true to their real-world counterparts, even with the added elements. There are no distortions apparent in the surfaces of the kayak and skateboard, indicating that their visual integrity has been maintained.",
