      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brick textures and shapes of the building and the \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign consistent with Lego bricks, without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's brick textures and the 'LAUNDROMAT' sign appear to be designed in the style of Lego, which is known for its distinct and uniform brick shapes and smooth surfaces. These features are typical in Lego renditions and are accurately replicated in the image without any visible artifacts or loss of detail. The sign and the building retain the classic rectangular brick pattern associated with Lego constructions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the person holding the laundry appear naturally integrated into the Lego-style environment without any visible distortion or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is transformed into a Lego figurine with articulated joints and the characteristic blocky appearance of Lego characters. The integration is seamless, as the figure's proportions, expressions, and position match the standard forms of Lego figures, blending naturally with the Lego environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the washing machines and interior elements are constructed to resemble Lego bricks. The details such as the circular doors and rectangular bodies are smoothly adapted to the Lego style, preserving structural integrity without fragmented or broken shapes, which is consistent with the precise and uniform design language of Lego products.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of folded laundry is designed to look like it is made of Lego elements. The items are represented as solid-colored rectangular pieces, typical of how objects are depicted in Lego form, thus they do not retain a realistic appearance and texture of natural fabric.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the scene, including the person, the laundry, and the laundromat, coherent and visually plausible as a stop-motion diorama crafted in the style of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire scene in Image B is cohesively transformed into a Lego-style diorama. The person, the laundry, and the laundromat are all crafted with Lego-like elements, consistent in design and scale, creating a visually logical and plausible composition characteristic of stop-motion dioramas made with Lego bricks.",
