      "question": "Does the transformation into a comic book style maintain the natural appearance of the chimney sweep and his equipment without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chimney sweep and his equipment are transformed into a stylized, comic book art form, characterized by bold outlines and solid colors typical of comic illustrations. This style inherently departs from natural realism, yet it doesn't introduce any artifacts that would be deemed unusual for this type of art. Comic book art often simplifies textures, making them appear smooth and silhouette-like. Therefore, the transformation maintains the style's expected natural appearance.",

      "question": "Does the added cityscape integrate naturally with the chimney sweep and the brick chimney without disrupting the visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape is positioned at the bottom, adding context to the illustration of the chimney sweep. The cityscape, rendered in a silhouette with bold outlines typical in comic book art, complements the chimney sweep's style. By employing similar visual themes and maintaining consistent shading and contrast, the cityscape integrates with the rest of the design without disrupting the visual credibility.",

      "question": "Does the yellow circle enhance the visual impact as a dramatic background element without causing distortion or breaking the geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow circle in Image B serves as a dramatic backdrop that contrasts well with the other elements of the image, providing a bold frame that enhances their visibility. It does not distort or break any geometric shapes; instead, it emphasizes them by providing a strong contrast that highlights the figures in the foreground.",

      "question": "Do the bold outlines and dramatic halftone shading preserve the structural consistency and avoid degrading fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines and halftone shading are typical characteristics of comic book art that are used to emphasize essential forms and features. While these techniques simplify details for dramatic effect, they do not degrade fine details beyond what is expected in this art form. The structural consistency remains intact, aligned with the comic style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The caption 'Just another day cleaning the city's lungs' in Image B appears at the bottom, in a simple and clear font, which is consistent with comic book narrative styles. It adds context without adding clutter or visually disrupting the main artwork as it follows the expected layout conventions. The placement and style are balanced, maintaining the natural flow of the image.",
