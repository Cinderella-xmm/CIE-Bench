      "question": "Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object of focus is a cylindrical golden container, not a teapot as in Image A. The container has smooth, continuous surfaces typical of cylindrical shapes, and there are no visible geometric distortions or irregularities. The sides, top, and bottom are uniform and symmetrical, which is consistent with the characteristics of a cylindrical shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden foil floral patterns clearly embossed with consistent depth, proper lighting interaction, and no signs of blurred edges or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden foil floral patterns appear clearly embossed, showing effective interaction with lighting, which highlights the embossing. There is no indication of blurred edges or artificial textures, as the details seem to be intricate and pronounced, reflecting attention to design quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the redesigned cups stacked in a stable, physically plausible manner with matching rim sizes and lids that fit securely without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no redesigned cups present nor any stacking to observe. The image depicts a single cylindrical container instead. Therefore, the question of stacking does not apply to Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Japanese calligraphy positioned at the top of the packaging with natural brushstroke variation and clear legibility, without clipping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Japanese calligraphy is present on the top of the packaging. The brushstroke variation appears natural, maintaining clear legibility. There are no signs of clipping or distortion, allowing the text to be easily read and appearing authentic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bamboo motif along the side of the container exhibits consistent node spacing and smooth edges, giving it a more realistic appearance. The grain texture appears natural, and there are no visible repeating or distorted segments, indicating attention to detail in the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the golden container is uniformly white and appears completely flat. There are no unintended shadows, textures, or reflections, suggesting a perfect isolation of the object against the white background for a clean presentation.",
