      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist fully integrated into the image with smooth contours, consistent line weight, and no visible seams or misaligned textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic teddy bear exhibits smooth contours that blend seamlessly into the background. The lines appear consistent, and there's no evidence of seams or misaligned textures, suggesting it is well integrated into the image. The teddy bear's features, including the lab coat and head, are well designed, indicating attention to detail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lab equipment illustrations (e.g., beakers, test tubes) proportionally accurate, geometrically intact, and aligned with the hand-drawn chalk style without jagged edges or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lab equipment illustrations in Image B, such as the beakers and test tubes, are proportionally accurate with clean lines and smooth curves. These elements are consistent with a hand-drawn chalk style, and there's no sign of jagged edges or unnatural shading. The edges are clean, suggesting careful illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all scientific symbols and doodles (such as planets, rockets, and formulas) have intact geometric forms, proper alignment, and no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several scientific symbols and doodles, including planets, rockets, and formulas, maintain intact geometric forms and are well-aligned. They avoid overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines, adhering to the cohesive theme of playful, educational illustrations on the chalkboard. Each element appears thoughtfully positioned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography (e.g., \"JOYFUL\", \"CURIOSITY\") clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the doodles, and free from blurring, stretching, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows typography that is clear and legible, such as the words \"JOYFUL\" and \"CURIOSITY.\" The stylistic consistency with the doodles is maintained, with no signs of blurring, stretching, or misalignment. Each word matches the playful theme of the chalk illustrations, enhancing the educational aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters (e.g., bear, rabbit) exhibit correct limb positioning, proportional body parts, and logical interaction with nearby objects without unnatural poses or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters, such as the bear, display correct limb positioning and proportional body parts. For example, the bear's raised hand and confident posture suggest logical interaction with the illustrated elements in the scene. The proportions are maintained, and there are no unnatural poses or visible deformations.",
