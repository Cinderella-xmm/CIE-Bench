      "question": "Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and STOP sign have been simplified into basic geometric shapes. The train is represented by a rectangular form and the STOP sign maintains its octagonal shape, which are fundamentally intact and visually coherent. There is no evidence of distortion or broken shapes in these elements, indicating a successful simplification process.",

      "question": "Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green mountain is represented by two simple triangular shapes, and the track lines are horizontal lines extending towards the STOP sign. These elements have been designed to fit within the minimalist style, which emphasizes simplicity and clarity. The shapes are coherent and smoothly integrated into the composition, maintaining a consistent style across the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a complete absence of textures, as it opts for a minimalist representation. While textures are sacrificed in this stylistic choice, this does not lead to an unnatural appearance in the context of minimalist design. The essence of the train and STOP sign is captured through their shapes and colors, which is a characteristic of minimalist design where detailed textures are not necessary.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses geometric shapes to represent the spatial arrangement observed in Image A. The train sits alongside the tracks with the STOP sign positioned towards the track's edge, establishing a plausible spatial correlation within the minimalist framework. Although abstracted, the spatial relationships are credibly maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B appears consistent, using simple and effective colors: green for the mountains, red for the STOP sign, and gray for the tracks. These colors are cool-toned and provide visual cohesion typical in minimalist design, supporting the traffic safety context by making key elements clear and easily differentiated from the backdrop.",
