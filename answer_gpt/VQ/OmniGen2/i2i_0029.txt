    "Question": "Q1: Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the extended stripes transform the grass into a stylized pattern that resembles the zebra's stripes. This creates an unnatural landscape that contrasts with the expected texture of grass, forming a surreal and artistic representation. Therefore, the stripes do not seamlessly blend with the grass as they create a noticeable and intentional pattern divergence.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes originating from the zebra are extended across the entire image, altering the background into a striped pattern. Although the zebra itself maintains its proportions, the additional stripes do not conform to the body's geometry; they extend outward into the setting, creating a larger pattern disconnected from the zebraâ€™s structure.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the background is transformed into a surreal pattern of stripes, the zebra remains distinct and visually discernible due to its central position and differentiated pattern. The bold extension does create a visually striking setting but does not overshadow the presence of the zebra itself.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the surreal extension of the stripes across the image, the zebra's key features, including its mane, ears, and legs, are still clearly visible and retain their natural appearance. The surreal background does not hinder the visibility or natural look of these features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are clearly defined and without degradation. However, the grass has been replaced by a surreal pattern that mimics the stripes. This artistic transformation introduces new visual elements intentionally, and while the zebra retains its detail, the background does not preserve the original grass detail.",
    "answer": "No"
