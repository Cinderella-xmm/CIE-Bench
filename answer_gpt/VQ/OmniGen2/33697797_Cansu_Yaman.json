      "question": "Do the transformed plants maintain recognizable plant-like structures without unnatural appendages or disproportionate body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants are accompanied by chibi or creature-like figures, but the plant-like structures themselves retain typical characteristics such as leaves and stems. Despite the fantasy setting, they still resemble natural plant forms without any bizarre extensions or body parts that are disproportionate. The visual styling is fanciful, yet it retains the core elements of recognizable plant anatomy.",

      "question": "Are the vine patterns on the leaves seamlessly blended with the leaf texture, showing no visible edges, clipping, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the vines and leaf textures appear naturally integrated without visible edges or awkward clipping. The shading is consistent, indicating a cohesive blending that makes the vines appear as part of the leaf itself rather than a separate overlay, showcasing a seamless design.",

      "question": "Do the magical orbs replace the original flowers in the same positions and emit light that interacts realistically with nearby surfaces and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orbs are incorporated into the setting but do not directly replace flowers seen in their specific positions. The orbs do emit light and appear in various locations, interacting with the environment, often casting reflections or subtle glows on surrounding surfaces, indicating a consideration for realistic light behavior.",

      "question": "Are the shelves positioned above the ground with soft shadows beneath them that align with the light source and do not show unnatural gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shelving units along the walls appear grounded with proper alignment to their surroundings. Soft shadows are visible beneath, aligned with the light positioned from above, ensuring there is no floating appearance or unnatural gaps between the units and the ground, reflecting thoughtful placement and shadow rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the iridescent foliage cascade from the ceiling in a way that follows the structural lines of the roof frame and allows light to diffuse naturally through its layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, foliage cascades down from the ceiling following the lines perceived from the glass and frame structure. The light interaction seems natural, diffusing through layers of foliage, contributing to an organic and realistic ambiance. This suggests that the design respects the architecture and allows for authentic light and shadow play.",
