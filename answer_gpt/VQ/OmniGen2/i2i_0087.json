      "question": "Are the shadows under and around the protruding clock consistent with its new 3D effect without creating artificial or inconsistent lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B match the direction of the light source and effectively depict a realistic depth, further emphasizing the clock's protrusion from the wall. They are cast uniformly which indicates consistency in lighting and no artificial effects. Through visual analysis, the shadows appear natural and in line with the clock's perceived depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the circular shape of the clock remain undistorted and geometrically sound after being altered to appear as if it protrudes from the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock retains its circular shape which appears perfectly round and undistorted. The visual cues confirm that despite the apparent 3D effect, the geometry of the clock remains sound and consistent with expectations for a circular object.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details on the clock face been preserved, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation as a result of making it appear 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B shows smooth, clean textures without any pixelation or unnatural artifacts. The visual resolution is high, and the details remain crisp, indicating that the editing process to make it appear 3D preserved the quality of original textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clock's hands and markings retain their original clarity, style, and proportion, contributing to a natural and credible appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the clock's hands and markings maintain their clarity and proportion, with the same style observed in the original. They are visually sharp and consistent with the design, contributing to a credible representation that aligns with real-world objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited clock appear to naturally integrate into the wall with a realistic thickness and depth, maintaining visual plausibility within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock in Image B appears to have a realistic thickness and depth due to consistent shading and the proportionality of its protrusion. This integration into the wall is visually plausible and mirrors how real-world clocks could appear when mounted, reflecting proper depth perception.",
