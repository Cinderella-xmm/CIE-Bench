    "Question": "Q1: Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is visually elongated and seamlessly attached to the head without any visible bends or breaks. This assessment is supported by the natural cartoon styling of the pelican where proportions are exaggerated but maintain a logical and connected form. The beak curves smoothly and connects directly to the head, which is a common design in caricatures where anatomical correctness is preserved even if the proportions are not realistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's feathers are depicted with a layered texture, notable in the illustration style which shows feather-like shapes with outlines that indicate layering. The pastel color shades enhance the lightness and cartoonish aspect, but they are not rendered in a flat or pixelated way. This depiction is indicative of an intentional design choice where texture is hinted at rather than fully rendered, fitting with a cartoon aesthetic where simplicity prevails.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the sailor hat positioned securely on the pelican’s head without overlapping the neck or appearing detached from the surface?",
    "explanation": "The sailor hat in Image B is placed on top of the pelican's head in a manner that appears secure. It does not show any overlap with the neck nor does it appear to be floating above the head. This suggests a careful integration in the illustration where the hat is part of the character design rather than a separate or misplaced element, demonstrating the cohesion expected in stylized illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the wooden plank background extend evenly behind the pelican without visible seams or inconsistencies in wood grain or lighting?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B features wooden planks that are even and consistent behind the pelican. The wood grain appears uniform and free from apparent seams or variations in lighting. This uniformity is consistent with a digital illustration where elements are frequently designed to maintain consistency and avoid the realism that might require more complex texturing or lighting effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the pelican’s legs and feet proportionally aligned with the body and not distorted or bent in an unnatural way?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's legs and feet are drawn in proportion to the body. They are correctly positioned under the body, appearing sturdy and supporting, indicative of a design choice that prevents any distortion or unnatural bending. In cartoon illustrations, while proportions can vary significantly compared to realistic depictions, they maintain logic within their art style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the pelican appear as a flat, two-dimensional object with minimal depth cues and clean edges, consistent with a magnet design?",
    "explanation": "The depiction of the pelican in Image B is characterized by clean edges, simplified shading, and minimal depth cues typical of flat, cartoonish illustrations. This representation often resembles designs meant for flat objects like magnets where emphasis is on outline crispness and vibrant color rather than three-dimensional realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
