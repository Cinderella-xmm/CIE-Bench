    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes positioned just below the label and do they follow the curvature of the bottle with consistent lighting and reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle label has been blurred, and there are no visible eyes or features positioned below the label. The bottle's lighting and reflection appear smooth and consistent without interruptions from any design features that would resemble eyes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vines wrap around the bottle in a continuous, physically plausible manner without floating or intersecting the bottle in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts vines wrapping around the bottle in a stylized manner. They appear attached to the bottle at several points and maintain consistent contact throughout, avoiding any unrealistic floating or unnatural intersection. This design reflects artistic interpretations commonly found in illustrations of nature-themed graphics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the modified label icon a clear, proportionate face with distinct features that match the original icon's style and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has blurred the region of the label where any icon would appear, making it impossible to discern any features such as a face or distinct design attributes. Thus, it cannot be determined if the icon matches the original style and size.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background include layered grapevines and mist that recede naturally without obscuring or clipping the bottle incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features grapevines extending into the distance, creating a depth-rich illustration. The mist and gradients add depth and recede naturally without intersecting or obscuring the bottle, suggesting a coherent scene layout commonly used in illustrations to depict vineyard pathways.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure\" clearly visible, correctly positioned, and free from rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible title 'The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure' on the label or anywhere else in Image B. The label region is blurred, concealing any text that might exist, and there are no rendering artifacts associated with any title.",
