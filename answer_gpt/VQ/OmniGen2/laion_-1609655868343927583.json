        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drawers have not been transformed into pouches with closure flaps and visible stitching. Instead, they remain as drawers integrated into the character design. Therefore, they do not hang from the robe or display any attachment points akin to pouches.",
