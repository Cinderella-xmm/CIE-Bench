      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the seaside café tabletop setting blend naturally with the table surface, avoiding any noticeable break in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the table where the cup of coffee sits appears smooth and continuous without any breaks in texture or unusual lighting changes. The lighting on the table matches the direction and intensity of natural sunlight, which suggests an integration in harmony with the setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of sea waves and sunlight reflections accurately depicted, maintaining structural consistency without unnatural breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea waves in Image B exhibit a natural flow and curvature, resembling typical oceanic wave patterns. The sunlight reflections are depicted with a realistic shimmer across the water's surface, forming a consistent, believable pattern without any evident distortions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials of the seaside elements, such as the table, sea waves, and sunlight reflections, appear authentic, free from unnatural textures and visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table in Image B has a wood-like texture that looks realistic and the water appears fluid with appropriate lighting reflection properties. The absence of abrupt color shifts or texture issues further supports this authenticity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sunlight reflections on the sea waves consistent with the sun's expected position, maintaining physical logic and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunlight reflections on the sea waves in Image B occupy a logical position relative to the perceived location of the sun in the sky. The light streaks align with the overall brightness and angle of the sunlight, reflecting a natural physical interaction between the sun and the water surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the seaside café setting fit naturally on the tabletop, enhancing the image's visual coherence without introducing distracting or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cup on the table is centrally placed, not obstructing any other visual elements like the sea waves or furniture, contributing to an organized and aesthetically pleasing composition. The scene captures a moment that is realistic and coherent, without any out-of-place objects or awkward transitions.",
