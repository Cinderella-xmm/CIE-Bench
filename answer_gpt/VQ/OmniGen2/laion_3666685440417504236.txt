    "Question": "Q1: Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the components inside the globe, such as the dome, minaret, and arches, appear to be well-crafted with clear attention to geometric integrity. The structures maintain proportional accuracy with smooth edges and no visible warping or breakages. These elements are carefully designed to fit the spherical shape of the globe, maintaining architectural consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
    "explanation": "Inside the globe in Image B, the palm trees and cobblestone path are scaled appropriately in relation to the architectural features such as the dome and the arches. The path leads logically to the entrance, which suggests a thought-out placement and consistent scale, enhancing the realism of the miniature scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
    "explanation": "The Persian patterns in Image B are applied continuously and are evenly spaced around the exterior of the globe. They emulate the intricate tilework style seen in the original building, preserving artistic and cultural consistency. The patterns flow without interruption, suggestive of high craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the dome and arches are applied in a manner that simulates natural light interaction. The highlights are gently illuminated without appearing flat or overly enhanced. The shading suggests a realistic reflection of lighting sources, avoiding artificial or excessively bright lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the boundary between the interior architectural scene and the globe's surface is seamless. There are no jagged edges, transparency issues, or unnatural reflections present, which indicates a well-executed integration of the scene within the globe's confines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
