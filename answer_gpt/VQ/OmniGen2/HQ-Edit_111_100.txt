    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire surface of the LEGO statue display uniform brick textures with no visible patches of residual wood grain or inconsistent material transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is designed to resemble a LEGO figure, and LEGO bricks are known for their consistent, smooth plastic surface. The image shows a uniform orange color throughout the statue, characteristic of LEGO bricks without any visible wood grain textures or inconsistent material transitions. This uniformity is typical of plastic, molded objects like LEGO figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed carvings on the headdress, chest plate, and belt represented by small, precisely placed LEGO bricks that preserve the original patterns without loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue resembles a LEGO figure, which suggests a simplified representation typical of LEGO designs. While the headdress, chest plate, and belt are visible, the nature of LEGO bricks means that they lack intricate detail due to their blocky, geometric form. Therefore, the complexities of carvings would not be maintained in a LEGO version. The patterns are present but simplified into block forms.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms, legs, and torso of the LEGO statue maintain natural human proportions with correctly scaled joints and limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue created is a LEGO version, which is characterized by its distinct stylized shape, lacking natural human proportions. LEGO figures are known for their exaggerated features such as large cylindrical arms, short legs, and rectangular torsos, which do not reflect natural human proportions. The joint connections also resemble that of LEGO figures.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both hands of the LEGO statue have five distinct fingers with natural finger positioning and no signs of merging or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is designed in the style of a LEGO figure, which traditionally features hands shaped like a curved claw, specifically to hold accessories and not with distinct, separate fingers like those on a human hand. Therefore, the design inherently lacks individually defined fingers, adhering to LEGO styling instead.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue centered on a flat white pedestal with realistic shadows and reflections that align with the lighting direction in the gallery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is placed on a flat white pedestal, and there are realistic reflections and shadows observable on the floor. The direction and placement of these shadows appear to correspond well with the overhead lighting in the gallery, suggesting that the image effectively aligns with the expected lighting dynamics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
