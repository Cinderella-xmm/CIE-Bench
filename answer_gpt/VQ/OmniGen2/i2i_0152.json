      "question": "Does the text 'Warm' at the top left blend seamlessly into the image without disrupting the natural appearance or introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Warm' is positioned prominently at the top left and contrasts with the background due to its bright color. Analyzing this area, the text does not blend seamlessly as it visually stands out, which is often the intention for placing text in images meant to convey a message. This graphic addition does not introduce unnatural artifacts, but it does naturally draw attention, which might not fit a seamlessly integrated appearance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Start' at the bottom right of Image B is added over the wooden table. It is positioned away from the central focus yet aligns well with the edge of the table without distortion or artifacts. The font style complements the overall warm ambiance of the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the areas around the text 'Warm' and 'Start' in Image B, there is consistency in texture and clarity with the rest of the image.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B presents a focused brand ad message.
