      "question": "Does the transformed dress exhibit smooth, flowing fabric folds consistent with celestial robes, without visible pixelation, unnatural sheen, or disrupted geometric patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B exhibits smooth and flowing fabric folds, which are indicative of celestial robes as seen in classical artwork. The visual cues suggest that the fabric is rendered with consistent texture and sheen, without any visible pixelation or unnatural distortions. This smoothness in texture and blend of colors supports the aesthetic of ethereal attire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold and silver filigree details aligned with the fabric’s surface and lighting direction, showing no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold and silver filigree details are intricately woven into the fabric, matching the fold and flow. The lighting direction aligns well with the design, highlighting edges effectively without any signs of floating or misalignment. The filigree appears to be part of the fabric rather than being suspended above it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the clouds beneath the figure have volumetric form and gradient shading that match the perspective and scale of the scene, avoiding flat or cartoonish rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B have a volumetric presence with smooth gradient shading, providing depth and realism to the scene. The shading is consistent with the perspective, adding dimensionality that avoids flatness or cartoon-like elements. The clouds fit well within the scene’s scale, enhancing the overall composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the starry night sky blended smoothly with dawn hues near the horizon, maintaining consistent illumination and avoiding abrupt color transitions or misplaced stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B features a seamless transition from starry night to dawn hues. The illumination across the sky is consistent, with gradual color shifts rather than abrupt changes. Stars are placed appropriately within the night section of the sky, avoiding any misplacement relative to the dawn setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands show five distinct fingers with natural proportions and skin texture, and do the glowing wisps emerge from the palms without intersecting or distorting the hand structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands clearly exhibit five distinct fingers with natural proportions and believable skin texture. The glowing wisps emerge cleanly from the palms, and these effects do not intersect or disrupt the anatomical structure of the hands, maintaining realism and coherence.",
