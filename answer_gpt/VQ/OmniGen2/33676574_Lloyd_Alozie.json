      "question": "Does the tallest tower on the left retain its original vertical structure and proportional height after being modified with robotic limb features, without any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower on the left shows the introduction of robotic limb features on its facade. The tower maintains its vertical structure and proportional height relative to other buildings in the skyline, with no visible signs of distortion such as stretching, compression, or broken edges. The addition appears to be seamless and well integrated, suggesting careful editing that respects the original dimensions and integrity of the building’s design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers smoothly integrated into the facade without visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neon circuitry patterns appear on the EMAAR building and other nearby towers. These patterns are presented without any visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients, indicating a smooth integration into the building facades. The editing seems meticulous, keeping in line with the buildings’ existing structures and maintaining visual coherence across the skyline.",

      "question": "Do the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior, with no repeating patterns or distorted shapes suggesting low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers maintain a uniform texture and reflection behavior. There is no indication of repeating patterns or distorted shapes, which could suggest low-quality rendering. This uniformity indicates a high-quality edit, ensuring that the towers’ natural reflective properties are preserved accurately in the image.",

      "question": "Do the glowing expressway spines maintain realistic width and curvature throughout their length, connecting logically to surrounding roads and showing no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing expressway spines maintain a consistent and realistic width and curvature. They logically connect to the surrounding road network without floating or appearing disconnected. This careful attention to detail demonstrates a realistic and plausible integration of these new features into the urban landscape, without any visually disturbing breaks or inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Are the fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately, without appearing detached or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, fin-like structures have been added to the tops of various buildings. These additions are aligned properly with the rooflines and are scaled appropriately, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with the architecture. The structures do not appear detached or structurally unstable, suggesting thoughtful planning in their design and integration into each building’s silhouette.",

      "question": "Are the holographic eye-like elements located on top of major towers clearly defined with smooth light emission and no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, holographic eye-like elements have been added to the tops of major towers. These elements exhibit smooth light emission without visible digital artifacts like aliasing or double images, indicating a high-quality execution in their depiction. The clarity and definition of these features emphasize the sophistication in the editing process.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details are sharp and legible, particularly on prominent structures like the EMAAR building and VOCO tower. There is no visible blurring or degradation due to the editing process, indicating a careful preservation of these details to maintain the overall clarity and realism of the image.",
