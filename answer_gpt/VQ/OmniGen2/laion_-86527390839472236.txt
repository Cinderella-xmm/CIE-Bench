    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed object maintain a tall, rectangular silhouette with smooth, continuous vertical sides and no visible warping or collapsed edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object retains a clear tall, rectangular shape with continuous, vertical sides that appear smooth and consistent, similar to a standard suitcase design. There are no indications of warping, bending, or edges that would suggest structural deformation. The consistent geometry suggests that its silhouette is maintained as intended, supporting the structural integrity visually.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the retractable handle replaced by a metallic spray nozzle that appears seamlessly attached to the top of the vessel, with no visible seams or material discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object retains the traditional feature of a retractable handle seen at the top, rather than a spray nozzle. The handle appears to be part of the common luggage design, and exhibits no characteristics of a spray nozzle setup. There is no indication of any modification to a nozzle-like structure.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the fabric panels replaced with translucent purple-tinted glass that shows uniform translucency and clearly defined embossed linear patterns matching the original seam locations?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the surface as a glossy, translucent purple material, resembling glass, which visually differs from the conventional fabric seen in luggage. This surface is consistent in translucency, implying a uniform material type without diversity in texture. However, while embossed linear patterns are visible, ensuring original seam locations' clarity can be subjective; the transparent medium might obscure direct pattern matching.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the logo positioned near the top center of the front face and rendered as a clean, subtle etching on the glass surface without any visible digital artifacts or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the logo is indeed located near the top center of the front panel. It is visually sharp, with well-defined edges that suggest etching onto a glass-like surface, avoiding signs of digital interference or blurring. The clarity and precision of the logo indicate deliberate placement and rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the four wheels replaced with identical decorative caps at each corner of the base, appearing as solid, polished elements without exposed mechanical parts or asymmetry?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, it is clear that the four wheels of the suitcase are present in their original form. They do not appear as decorative caps but rather retain their functional appearance and structure, with visible components that are standard in wheeled luggage design.",
    "answer": "No"
