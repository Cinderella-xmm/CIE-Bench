      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the isometric representation of the figurine box maintain consistent angles and edges without distorted or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine box displays clear and consistent angles. The lines defining the edges of the box are straight and intersect at appropriate points to form a coherent geometric shape. This consistency suggests proper perspective and undistorted geometry, a characteristic of well-rendered isometric representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral-themed accents on the figurine box proportionally sized and textured in a way that matches the material and style of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral accents on the figurine box are aligned with the overall size and style of the box, suggesting careful graphic design. The flowers are neither too large nor too small, maintaining visual harmony with the box's design, and the texture suits the likely paper or cardboard material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chibi cat figure positioned correctly within the box, with its body fully contained and aligned with the interior space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cat is seated within the boundaries of the box's opening, with no part of the figure protruding outside the visible interior space. The alignment suggests it is appropriately placed, with a clear view provided by the open side of the box.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes of the chibi cat exhibit smooth, uniform glass-like reflection without visible pixelation or irregular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cat's eyes have a glossy appearance with smooth reflections, indicative of detailed and high-resolution rendering. There are no noticeable pixelation or irregular highlights, which contributes to the eyes' realistic, glass-like quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the fur texture of the realistic cat figure beside the box show consistent flow and detail comparable to the original catâ€™s fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture on the realistic cat figure is cartoonish and lacks the intricate flow and detail seen in Image A's cat. The edited image presents a simplified and stylized representation, more aligned with the chibi aesthetic rather than realistic depiction.",
