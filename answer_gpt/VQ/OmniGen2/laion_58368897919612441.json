      "question": "Are the two towers and the central wall of the fortress proportionally reduced without distortion or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature fortress inside the dome features two towers and a central wall that appear proportionally reduced without noticeable distortion or broken geometry, adhering to the common characteristics of model replicas. They look uniformly scaled down, maintaining architectural coherence without disproportionate elements or warped structures, which aligns with expectations for miniaturized architectural models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss covering the ground exhibit natural texture and color gradients, resembling real moss rather than a uniform or painted surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss covering the ground within the dome shows variations in texture and color, resembling the irregularity of real moss. This observation is guided by the presence of subtle color gradients and apparent texture changes across the surface, mimicking the organic appearance expected in actual moss rather than a flat, uniform coating.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the model knights positioned on the moss at a scale consistent with the miniature fortress, and do they rest fully on the ground without floating or intersecting with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the model knights are positioned next to the fortress on the moss. They appear to be at an appropriate scale relative to the miniature fortress, enhancing the realism by maintaining expected proportions. The knights seem to be resting on the moss, with no visible signs of floating or intersecting with other elements, which indicates a successful integration into the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the faux stone pathways extend from the fortress base onto the moss with consistent texture and alignment, matching the original stonework without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts faux stone pathways extending from the base of the miniature fortress onto the moss. These pathways show a consistent texture that aligns with the fortress stonework, with no apparent gaps or misalignments. This continuity suggests careful modeling, ensuring that the pathways integrate smoothly with the surrounding environment for a coherent presentation.",

      "question": "Is the glass star transparent and reflective, positioned precisely at the top of the central tower's spire without overlapping or deforming the underlying structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a glass star is visible at the top of the central tower's spire. The star appears transparent and reflective, which are typical characteristics of a glass object. It is positioned accurately without overlapping or deforming the tower beneath, maintaining the intended symmetry and design of the miniature structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the terrarium dome smoothly curved and transparent, enclosing the fortress without visible seams, warping, or optical distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a smoothly curved terrarium dome enclosing the miniature fortress. The dome appears transparent and free from visible seams or warping, allowing clear viewing of the contents without optical distortions. These qualities suggest high craftsmanship in creating a visually accessible and aesthetically pleasing display.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wooden stand beneath the terrarium have visible wood grain, weathering, and design details consistent with vintage craftsmanship, and does it securely support the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden stand beneath the terrarium exhibits visible wood grain, which aligns with the natural texture found in wood. The stand also appears to have design elements that indicate a vintage style, such as clear attention to detailed craftsmanship. It securely supports the dome, as evidenced by the stable placement and absence of tilt or imbalance.",
