      "question": "Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the batik patterns on the dancer's dress appear sharp and well-defined, without noticeable pixelation or jagged edges. The patterns look continuous, suggesting a high-quality digital rendering. This assessment is based on the observation of smooth lines and consistent detailing in the pattern. Hence, they seem free from digital artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line-drawn temple illustration replicates the tier alignment and structural symmetry accurately. The layers of the temple roof are consistent and symmetrical, maintaining the original design seen in the photorealistic depiction. There are no visible distortions or missing elements, suggesting a careful reproduction of structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guardian statues flanking the pathway appear similar in size and pose, creating a symmetrical composition around the central temple axis. They have identical styling, which aids in balancing the design of the illustration. Comparison with Image A further confirms this symmetry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both of the dancer’s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s hands appear to show five fingers each, with natural spacing and smooth contours observed in their representations. There are no obvious deformations or extra digits, suggesting a normal and anatomically accurate rendering of human hands.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is positioned around the central elements like the dancer, temple, and guardian statues in a manner that avoids overlap or obstruction. The text remains readable and does not cause visual clutter, demonstrating attention to layout and clarity.",
