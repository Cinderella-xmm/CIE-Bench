      "question": "Does the mango retain its recognizable shape and texture in the 8-bit pixel art style without appearing overly distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango's recognizable shape is preserved in the 8-bit pixel art style, maintaining a simplified but coherent representation. 8-bit art typically reduces detail for stylization and abstraction. The pixel art shows a notably shaped mango that corresponds well to a typical mango form. Despite the lack of texture detail due to pixelation, the overall shape is consistent.",

      "question": "Are the table and napkin depicted with consistent structure and proportions in the 8-bit pixel art style, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or disproportionate elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and napkin are depicted in an 8-bit style, resulting in simplified geometric shapes with reduced detail consistent with this art form. Despite the pixel art abstraction, the structural integrity is maintained, showing recognizable and proportionately correct representations of both the table and napkin without visible distortion or disproportion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the fine details of the mango's surface and the napkin's texture remain discernible in the 8-bit pixel art style, without significant loss or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "8-bit pixel art inherently reduces details significantly, particularly surface textures. In Image B, both the mango and napkin show a simplified representation, focusing more on shapes and colors rather than fine textures. Thus, the details are mostly abstracted, resulting in a loss of precise texture detail as expected in this style, but the composition does not introduce unnatural patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadow effects on the mango and table in the 8-bit pixel art style appear natural and plausible, without introducing any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow effects are stylized according to 8-bit pixel art, showing broader, less detailed gradients and color blocks rather than realistic effects. The representation is abstract but does not introduce artifacts or inconsistencies beyond typical limitations of the art style. It conveys basic lighting and shadow in line with 8-bit aesthetics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the mango, napkin, and table in the 8-bit pixel art style visually credible and structurally sound, without any elements appearing misplaced or out of context?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a coherent composition despite the abstraction of 8-bit pixel art. The mango, napkin, and table appear correctly laid out in relation to each other, with no components misplaced or out of context. The artwork follows a logical grouping of objects compatible with the supposedly intended layout seen in realistic depictions.",
