    "Question": "Q2: Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes appear to have been edited to hold flowers instead. While hands generally consist of five fingers and often adapt to hold items comfortably by distributing grip pressure, these edited hands show partial visibility of fingers, with some entirely missing or clipped, affecting the natural appearance. Recognizing the typical anatomy of the hands indicates the absence or slight unnatural appearance, as fingers may not fully grip the objects in a realistic way within the image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
    "explanation": "The poses in Image B seem to include individuals standing upright, with joints and limbs appearing generally proportionate and aligned. While it is common for group photos to have individuals stand in balanced and plausible positions, the editing does not disproportionately warp body segments, maintaining bodily coherence.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the dialogue bubbles positioned above or near the heads of the individuals without overlapping eyes or mouths, and do they display legible text with clean edges and no visual artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dialogue bubbles are placed above the individualsâ€™ heads, avoiding overlaps with their eyes or mouths. The text inside the bubbles is not entirely legible and contains distorted letters, which can sometimes result in visual artifacts not seen typically in speech bubbles meant for clarity. Proper positioning is achieved, but legibility isn't met given typical reading standards.",
    "answer": "No"

    "explanation": "In Image B, the garden background appears visually coherent with consistent lighting and natural flower arrangements. While flower arrangement happens naturally in gardens, the edited scene maintains these characteristics, without abrupt color shifts or artificial textures that usually happen due to misaligned edits.",
