    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown-like head is derived from the original teapot lid seen in Image A. The lid maintains a smooth, symmetrical metallic surface without perceptible distortion or broken geometry. The detailed engravings resemble those of the teapot's surface in Image A, indicating consistent artistry and surface treatment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation of the spout into a beak in Image B maintains the continuity of the metallic surface originally seen on the teapot in Image A. The smooth curve of the beak is void of cracks, abrupt bends, or texture mismatches, showcasing a seamless adaptation from the original design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image A is transformed into a tail in Image B. This transformation retains the smooth curvature and proportional alignment to the rest of the owl's body, avoiding abrupt angles or inconsistencies in the metallic material, thereby ensuring a harmonious design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical eyes in Image B are symmetrically placed, exhibiting a soft glow with well-defined cogs visible within. There is no evident halo effect or color bleeding, and the texture of the eyes matches seamlessly with the metallic surface of the owl's head, indicating a well-executed design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden branch supporting the owl features consistent wood texture and shadowing that adds depth to the scene. Compared to the table surface in Image A, the branch integrates naturally into the scene, enhancing the visual composition without any noticeable texture inconsistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved patterns on the body of Image B resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality. These patterns maintain a high level of detail and clarity without pixelation or detail loss and are reminiscent of the intricate engravings on the teapot in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
