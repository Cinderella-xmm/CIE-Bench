      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a stylized design where wooden planks appear straight and aligned, suggesting seamless integration. The texture is consistent with no visible gaps or misalignment, typical of well-constructed wooden structures. Despite the playful artistic style, the integration appears smooth, indicating no issues with texture repetition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature moss textures visibly. The design is straightforward, emphasizing clean lines and primarily wooden, stone elements without additional textures suggesting moss. Therefore, given the absence of moss, it’s not applicable in this instance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cohesive color palette, using earthy tones for roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements. The colors appear uniform across the image without noticeable gradients or discolorations, maintaining consistency akin to a well-executed color scheme often seen in illustrated or animated designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are scaled reasonably over the layout, positioned near doors and paths, reflecting plausible positioning relative to the house’s scale. There is no indication of characters floating or intersecting with other elements, suggesting realistic spatial arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchments in Image B are placed flat on the base platform. They contain detailed texturing mimicking real parchment, alongside shadows that align with the general lighting direction. The folds and texture are realistic and cohesive within the design style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays booklets with sufficient detailing and realistic representation. Despite stylization, the booklets have consistent dimensions, discernible spine details, and shadows cast that match the lighting, thus aligning the elements logically within the design context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
