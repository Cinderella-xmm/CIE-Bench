        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the LEGO person and giraffe figures showcase a smooth, polished surface typical of LEGO pieces. The intricate designs such as the giraffeâ€™s spots and the person's clothing reveal a consistent texture with no anomalies. Using world knowledge about LEGO, we know they are designed to have clean, well-defined plastic surfaces without any deformities or irregularities.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigures in Image B, including the person and the giraffe, retain their classic LEGO shape. The person has the characteristic blocky form, while the giraffe is detailed yet conforms to the expected LEGO style with consistent proportions. No obvious damage or inconsistencies in their geometric forms is observed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B transitions softly and complements the LEGO scene without overwhelming or clashing with the colors of the figures and the glass. The smoothness of the gradient aids in maintaining a natural look for the overall image, adhering to good design principles.",
