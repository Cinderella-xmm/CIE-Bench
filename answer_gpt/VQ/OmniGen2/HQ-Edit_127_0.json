      "question": "Are the textures of the owl’s feathers and the tree bark rendered with realistic detail and variation, without unnatural repetition or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl’s feathers and tree bark are rendered in a stylized manner rather than realistic detail. The feathers show uniformity and lack natural variation typically seen in realistic textures. The tree bark also appears patterned and stylized, not capturing the irregularity of real bark. Therefore, the image does not fully adhere to realistic rendering of details and variations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moon depicted as a circular dotted diagram with evenly spaced dots and clear, legible labels indicating lunar phases, without jagged edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is shown with evenly spaced dots forming a circle around it. However, the labels appear illegible and not clear, and there is a synthetic feel to the arrangement that does not indicate lunar phases accurately. The diagram style appears more artificial and less natural than expected for clear lunar phase indication.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the labels pointing to the owl’s talons and feathers placed without overlapping vital features, and do they use consistent line styles and text formatting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, labels are placed to point to specific parts of the owl, such as talons and feathers. The lines do not overlap with other features, suggesting careful placement. However, while the line style appears consistent, the text formatting does not appear fully clear, as some text is illegible which detracts from the clarity of consistent text formatting and placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text box located at the bottom of the image, sized appropriately, and styled with earthy tones and readable typography that matches the botanical illustration theme?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottom of Image B features a text box styled in earthy tones suitable for the botanical theme. While the color is in harmony with the theme, the typography is not readable, as much of the text appears scrambled or illegible. This mismatch in intended clarity for typography affects the overall suitability.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the owl sit naturally on the tree branch with correct posture and claw positioning, and is the tree trunk and branch structure continuous and anatomically plausible without breaks or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is depicted seated on a branch, but its posture appears slightly stylized, rather than naturally capturing the typical seating posture of an owl. The anatomical portrayal of the claws and the structure of the tree is stylized and lacks the realistic continuous branching seen in nature, which detracts from plausibility.",
