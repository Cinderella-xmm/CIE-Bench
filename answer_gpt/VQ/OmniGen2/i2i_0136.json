      "question": "Does the orange retain a realistic glossy texture without unnatural or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange displays a smooth and glossy surface texture which is commonly associated with shiny objects. The lighting enhances this effect, and there are no visible signs of pixelation or artifacts that would detract from its realism. This smooth texture reflects light naturally and maintains visual fidelity indicating a realistic rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the stem of the orange well-integrated into the rubber keychain design, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the orange with its stem attached to a loop, which is characteristic of keychain designs. The stem appears to merge naturally with the loop on top, preserving the natural appearance typically seen in orange stems despite the integration into the keychain design, maintaining realism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and shape of the keychain maintain a believable keychain structure, avoiding any distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the orange's proportions are consistent with typical spherical objects used for keychains. It does not exhibit any distorted features, such as irregular shapes or warpings. The loop further reinforces its identity as a keychain, creating a coherent and believable structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the color of the orange keychain accurately reflect a citrus hue, contributing to the authenticity and visual credibility of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange presents a vibrant and saturated hue typical of a ripe citrus fruit. This color choice contributes significantly to the authenticity, as it matches the expected appearance and enhances its visual credibility. The bright orange color effectively mimics how a real orange would be perceived.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the rubber keychain material and the orange's surface seamless, contributing to overall visual coherence and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a clean transition between the orange's surface and the metallic loop of the keychain. No abrupt changes or gaps are visible, ensuring smooth integration between materials, which contributes to the overall visual coherence and enhances the plausibility of the rubber keychain design.",
