    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed bottle maintain the same elongated vertical silhouette as the original dress, with no compression or stretching of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle has a vertical silhouette; its design mirrors a dress's elongated form. The bottle does not appear stretched or compressed, but presents a similarity in shape with the flowing, vertical design seen on the dress in Image A. Using world knowledge, such a design aims to reflect elegance and continuity in form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the petal motifs clearly visible as raised embossments on the glass surface, with consistent depth and spacing matching the original dress's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petal motifs are visible on the glass surface but do not exhibit raised embossments; instead, they are part of the design printed or embedded onto the bottle. Comparing with Image A, the original dress features three-dimensional petals. Understanding glass design typically involves more subtle imprints than direct texture replication due to material properties.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cap shaped like a stylized red flower with natural petal curvature and symmetry, and does it sit properly on the bottle neck without floating or overlapping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle cap is indeed shaped like a stylized red flower, with petals exhibiting natural curvature and symmetry. The cap sits properly on the bottle neck, aligning as would be expected in realistic product design. This echoes a natural integration seen in the original dress's floral design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic label seamlessly attached to the glass surface with smooth edges, realistic reflection, and legible cursive text, without blurring, misalignment, or shadow mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a metallic label on the bottle with smooth edges and realistic reflection. The cursive text is legible and well-aligned. There's no indication of blurring or shadow mismatch, displaying a coherent, well-conceived design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the neck, body, and base of the bottle proportionally balanced and structurally sound, with no unnatural tapering or abrupt shape changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle's neck, body, and base present as proportional and balanced. The design flows naturally without abrupt changes in shape. This reflects common principles in product design where continuity and harmony are prioritized.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the boundary where the fabric dress transitions into the glass bottle, indicating poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a bottle design without any visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding. The transition from the concept of fabric to glass is smooth, suggesting a well-executed transformation without blending issues. This comparison aligns with how such details can be misconstrued in hastily edited images.",
