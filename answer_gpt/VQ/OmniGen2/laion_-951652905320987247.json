    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the snow-capped peak exhibit a consistent, non-uniform glittering texture that mimics natural snow while avoiding blocky or artificial sparkles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-capped peak is visually represented with a smooth texture, consistent with the stylized design of a miniature model rather than a realistic photograph. It features a deliberate, uniform sparkle characteristic of an artful representation rather than a natural snowy surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree lines and grasslands along the base of the mountain rendered with natural variation in color and density, without repeating brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a stylized depiction of trees and grasslands characteristic of miniature models. The trees are uniform and consistently spaced, representing crafted elements rather than a natural landscape, often using repeated shapes and colors without natural variation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lake surface uniformly reflective with no visible distortion, warping, or artificial shine that breaks the continuity of the mountain's reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake surface is portrayed with a smooth, glass-like texture typical of miniature or model scenes, lacking realistic reflection features, suggesting artificial rather than natural qualities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chalet figurines positioned at ground level along the shoreline with proper scale and shadow alignment, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, chalet figurines are positioned strategically within the model, but the lighting in the scene is uniform and doesnâ€™t accurately mimic realistic shadow dynamics. The chalets are proportional within their context, yet the absence of dynamic shadows due to the lighting in a controlled environment suggests staged alignment rather than natural positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, distortions, or artificial reflections around the perimeter of the scene that suggest an unnatural glass boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a scene contained within a glass sphere, clearly indicating an artificial boundary due to the visible reflections and rounded distortion at the perimeter. The reflections on the glass surface suggest the presence of this boundary, indicating it is not an open natural scene.",
