    "Question": "Q1: Are the bold primary colors applied to the train's body consistent across all surfaces without visible color bleeding or mismatched tones?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a comic-style coloring with bold primary colors like blue, yellow, and red applied to the train’s body. These colors are consistent across all surfaces and do not show bleeding. This style typically favors crisp edges and solid fills, ensuring the colors remain uniform across different surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the halftone dot patterns on the train display consistent size, spacing, and alignment across all visible panels without distortion or clustering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, halftone dot patterns are primarily used in the background, particularly the sky. The train itself does not seem to have these dot patterns applied. Since the question implies dot patterns on the train, which aren't present, the dots shown display consistent size, spacing, and alignment where they are used, but not necessarily on the train.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the geometric shapes used to replace the barn’s wood texture aligned with the original architectural elements such as windows, doors, and roofline without breaking their structural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the barn by using stylized geometric shapes, maintaining a flat, cartoonish effect. Windows, doors, and the roofline are drawn with simple lines and shapes that uphold these architectural boundaries without altering or breaking them, ensuring they are consistent with the overall structure of the barn.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the graphic bursts representing foliage positioned in a way that respects the original spatial layout, with no overlapping or misplaced elements that contradict the scene’s depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage is represented as graphic bursts of color. These bursts maintain a similar spatial layout as the original scene in Image A, aligning with surrounding elements like the tracks and buildings, preserving depth and spatial integrity without arbitrary positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the black outlines around the train, barn, and foliage uniformly sharp, continuous, and free from gaps or misalignments at object edges?",
    "explanation": "The edited image uses pronounced black outlines to define the shapes of the train, barn, and foliage. These outlines are characteristic of comic or pop art styles, typically ensuring sharpness and uniform continuity along the edges. In Image B, these outlines maintain their integrity without visible gaps or misalignments, keeping the shapes distinct.",
    "answer": "Yes"
