    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the fur of the plush dog appear uniformly soft and textile-like with no visible pixelation or unnatural texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur of the plush dog is visually smooth, resembling the texture commonly seen in high-quality stuffed animals. There are no apparent pixelation or texture artifacts that would be inconsistent with a plush toy's typical material, thus providing an appearance of uniform softness.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the crystal-studded corset properly aligned with the dog's torso and does it display consistent, physically plausible reflections and sparkle without distorted shapes or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal-studded corset looks tightly fit around the plush dog's torso. The reflections and sparkle from the crystals appear naturally distributed without visible distortions or misplacement. This suggests the elements are correctly aligned and the sparkle effect is consistent with how light interacts with shiny surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dog’s paws positioned correctly so that they slightly dangle over the edge of the shelf without intersecting or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the dog's paws is such that they appear to rest on the shelf. There are no visual indications of incorrect placement, such as floating or intersecting with surfaces unnaturally. This suggests correct positioning as one would expect in reality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sandy-colored spots on the plush dog’s ears and face maintain their original placement and shape as seen in the original image, without bleeding or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, since the face is blurred, it is difficult to assess any differences accurately regarding the placement and shape of the sandy-colored spots compared to Image A. Therefore focusing on other visible areas like the ears, there is no bleeding or distortion observed on those spots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the plush dog, including the snout, mouth, and nose, proportionally accurate and structurally coherent with the rest of the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to face being blurred, it is not possible to assess the proportional accuracy or structural coherence of facial features like the snout, mouth, and nose. The task of evaluation is hindered because the crucial facial characteristics are not visible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
