      "question": "Does the enlarged strumming hand have five fingers with natural joint alignment and ergonomic shape, without any extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the strumming hand is visible on the guitar. By examining the image, we can observe that the hand does have five fingers, and they are naturally aligned with proper ergonomic shape. There are no signs of additional fingers or unnatural joint bending, which indicates accurate depiction with respect to human hand anatomy. The fingers are spread out naturally as one would expect when strumming a guitar string.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style for the girl's face, hair, and clothing appears to be seamless. The transition to the cartoon style shows smooth integration with no jagged lines or pixelation. The shading is appropriately consistent with the style, providing smooth gradients and keeping in line with typical cartoon aesthetics, ensuring fluid visual presentation.",

      "question": "Do the watercolor band logos on the wall have soft brushstroke textures and natural color gradients without sharp digital edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows watercolor band logos on the wall that include cat images and text. Via observation, the logos maintain a soft texture akin to brushstrokes, providing a natural gradient transition for colors. There are no sharp, digital edges or unnatural color transitions, as they simulate traditional watercolor techniques well, presenting a realistic view expected of such art styles.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cat silhouette positioned on the bed without overlapping the edge of the blanket or pillow, and does it have smooth, non-jagged edges with a uniform pastel fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat silhouette is part of the wall art, not physically positioned on the bed. It is represented with smooth and non-jagged edges along with a consistent fill color, matching pastel art styles, which maintains its integrity as a cartoon representation without being part of bedding material.",

      "question": "Is the writing box proportionally sized relative to the stool, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the room's lighting direction without appearing floating or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the writing box is positioned on the bed, not on a stool. The proportional size relative to the bed edges provides coherent scale and spatial presence. It also casts a shadow consistent with lighting direction within the room, ensuring it visually stands as a natural part of the environment without floating appearance.",
