      "question": "Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hammer handle in Image B shows a smooth wooden surface without any added elements such as logos or engravings. The integration of any added features like a logo would typically require matching the natural texture and color of the wood to avoid visual inconsistencies such as jagged edges or mismatched color contrast. Observing the hammer handle closely, it appears consistent in texture and color without any logos. Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no visible texture mismatch because there is nothing integrated into the handle.",

      "question": "Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood shavings appear clean and untouched, bearing no text or lettering. For text to appropriately appear on such a surface, it would need to adhere to the natural curves and thickness variations of the shavings. Given that no lettering is visible, there are no concerns regarding flatness, stretching, or floating aspects.",

      "question": "Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The banner in Image B features a wood-like texture and appears to be part of the scene rather than digitally pasted. It's positioned consistently with scene lighting, casting appropriate shadows, and blending well with the other workshop elements. The texture and tonal qualities match those expected in a wood or fabric banner, suggesting no digital inconsistency.",

      "question": "Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper accents in Image B display uniform lighting and shading that aligns with the lighting conditions of the workshop setting. The gradual transition from lighted areas to shadows is consistent and doesn't disrupt or contrast sharply with the grayscale tones of the pegboard. The copper coloring is naturally integrated without unrealistic reflections.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the labeled sign resembles a business card affixed to the pegboard with an appropriate perspective and scale relative to the tools and surrounding elements. While there is no distinct shadow cast separately from the card itself, the sign is aligned well in its positioning. The lighting does maintain consistent shading following ambient illumination, indicating proper integration.",
