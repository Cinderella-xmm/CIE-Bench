      "question": "Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure appear smooth and consistent. The texture is uniform, and there are no visible imperfections such as cracks, pixelation, or shading mismatches. This observation is based on the clarity and coherence of the finishes that appear polished and refined without signs of visual distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the metal automatons do have articulated limbs and their clothing fits the body shape well. However, they seem to lack the detailed articulation of fingers; instead, they appear to have more simplified representations. The clothing seems to properly conform to their forms, without excessive or unnatural wrinkles, and there are no floating fabric elements.",

      "question": "Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass lantern in Image B is well-defined, with clear lines demarcating its shape. The transparent sides of the lantern are visible, allowing for a view into the contained scene without distortion. There is noticeable metal framing that encases the scene effectively, and no sections appear to be overlapping or missing. The intact enclosure gives the appearance of a seamless protective cover around the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam clouds in Image B exhibit smooth gradients and soft, blurred edges that suggest a natural, wispy appearance. The edges of the clouds are rounded and lack jagged borders, contributing to a coherent visual representation. Additionally, the colors are consistent without abrupt shifts that would disrupt the natural appearance of steam, further enhancing the realistic depiction within the enclosed scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags are positioned logically according to the scale and layout of the ship model under the glass dome. The compass doesn't appear separately but as a thematic element consistent with the setting's representation. The placement and sizes of elements do not distort spatial relationships but instead reinforce the miniature style within the scene’s confines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B features visible gears and mechanical components that are properly attached to the structure. These elements follow the contours of the hull and deck, adhering closely without appearing to float or intersect unrealistically. The supports are visible where needed, which maintains the coherence and supports the integrity of the mechanical design.",
