      "question": "Are the cloud formations above the explosion composed of distinct geometric shapes that follow the overall contour of the mushroom cloud without disrupting its volumetric form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formations above the explosion are designed with distinct geometric shapes such as rounded curves and loops. These shapes adhere to the contour of the mushroom cloud, maintaining a cohesive outline and volumetric form typical of a mushroom cloud explosion. By using simplified shapes, the image captures the essence of the cloud without being disrupted, fitting the pop art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the neon-colored elements in the explosion maintain consistent brightness and contrast relative to the surrounding sky and water, avoiding abrupt or physically implausible luminance shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon colors in Image B, including bright yellow, pink, and blue, maintain consistent brightness and contrast against the other vibrant colors in the sky and water. These colors do not display abrupt shifts or implausible luminance changes, instead aligning well with the pop art aesthetic, which often uses vivid colors uniformly across components.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted with thick black outlines and simplified shapes, positioned correctly along the beach wall without overlapping or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are illustrated with thick black outlines and simplified shapes that are typical of pop art style. They are correctly positioned along the beach, providing a clear view with no overlapping or misaligned edges, thus contributing to the image's overall balance and organization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the island’s terrain been reduced to abstract geometric shapes that maintain correct spatial relationships with the sea and horizon, without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the island's terrain as an abstract geometric shape—essentially a flat silhouette sitting atop the sea and horizon. This simplicity ensures that it adheres to a correct spatial relationship with no sections floating or appearing disconnected. The design is consistent with pop art principles.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sky and water rendered with flat colors and clean outlines, matching the pop art style, without visible texture degradation or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sky and water are illustrated using flat, bright colors. These colors possess clean outlines and do not show any texture degradation or mismatched lighting effects, aligning with the pop art style. This helps maintain the image's integrity without compromising the visual elements typically expected in such artwork.",
