      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements (birds and branch) and the new background (starry night sky and moon) appear seamless without any unnatural artifacts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds and branch maintain a consistent level of detail and texture that blends well with the new starry night background. There are no visible seams or artifacts where the original elements meet the new sky. The birdsâ€™ silhouettes, combined with the backlighting from the moon and stars, create a natural transition that does not disrupt the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and lighting of the starry night sky consistent with the rest of the image, and do they not introduce any unnatural artifacts or conflicting light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited starry night sky features a deep blue which is consistent with typical night scenes. The lighting on the birds and the branch is consistent, with warm tones blending with the cool sky due to the realistic portrayal of ambient moonlight. There are no visible artifacts or conflicting light sources that look unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the placement and appearance of the new moon natural within the context of the night sky, and does it not appear out of place or overly bright compared to the stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon in Image B is placed in a typical position within the night sky, and its brightness complements the scene without overshadowing the stars. It appears proportionate and natural, casting appropriate lighting on the birds, matching the overall ambient light of a moonlit night.",

      "question": "Do the birds retain their detailed features, texture, and proportions after the background change, showing no signs of distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds maintain their detailed feather texture and natural proportions, similar to typical photographic standards. The background change has not caused any noticeable distortion or loss of detail, ensuring the birds remain a focal point in the scene.",

      "question": "Do the tree branch and leaves appear naturally lit and integrate seamlessly with the starry night sky, without any obvious inconsistencies in shadowing or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch and leaves in Image B are lit in a manner consistent with a moonlit atmosphere, showing the appropriate amount of shadow and highlight consistent with the edited scene. There are no apparent inconsistencies in shadowing or lighting which would disrupt the natural integration with the starry night sky.",
