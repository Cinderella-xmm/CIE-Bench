      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object described is a LEGO model rather than a wood-carved object. No fabric textures are present, as the dog in Image B has been replaced with a LEGO sculpture. This sculpture reflects plastic material with smooth surfaces typical of LEGO bricks, rather than detailed grain patterns of wood or the texture of fabric. Therefore, the question does not apply to Image B as it does not feature wood carving or fabric textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO sculpture in Image B is a well-constructed model resembling a lion's head, not a dog's body. While the bricks form a coherent structure, the subject differs significantly from Image A, where the focus is on a living dog's attire. Thus, there's no instance of bricks forming an anatomically plausible layer over a dog's body, nor do they present gaps or inconsistencies that violate physical logic as the sculpture is head-only.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a light-colored wooden tabletop that is consistently lit and complements the LEGO model. The lighting on both the tabletop and the model is uniform, creating a naturally blended image with no visible abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches. This consistent lighting suggests proper compositing and integration of subject and background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B does not feature any wood-carved hat or ear flaps, as the subject is a LEGO lion head model. There are no ear flaps or their positioning to be assessed on Image B's LEGO creation, hence the question doesn't apply.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks forming the lion's head exhibit clear edge definition, appropriate shading, and logical placement, consistent with a well-crafted LEGO model. There are no apparent blocky artifacts or color clumps within the structure. These features ensure a smooth visual continuity in the representation, particularly in how each brick contributes to an articulate depiction of the subject.",
