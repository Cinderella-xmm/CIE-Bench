      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the stave church have clear, smooth surfaces with realistic reflections and no visible distortion or warping of the church beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass display case exhibits smooth surfaces that clearly encapsulate the miniature stave church. The visual presentation indicates that the glass is transparent without visible distortion, maintaining the proportion and perspective of the contents inside the case without warping. This suggests that the glass is high-quality and provides precise reflections typical of smooth, flat glass surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layered clouds in the background panel translucent and softly blended, showing depth without blocking or distorting the mountain range behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds in the background are light and airy, creating a sense of depth in the sky. They are blended softly and appear translucent, allowing the mountain range to be visible behind them, with no signs of obstruction or distortion. This softness helps in providing a naturalistic scenic depth to the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the small coniferous trees near the base of the church properly scaled, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the larger trees in the surrounding forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small coniferous trees are proportional relative to the scale of the stave church model, and they are spaced at regular intervals around the base. Their style and color are consistent with the larger trees seen in the background, maintaining a uniform aesthetic throughout the diorama setup, which aligns with realistic diorama conventions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains and sky in the background use a consistent muted palette that complements the dark wood tones of the church without creating jarring color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B employs a cohesive, muted color palette, featuring subtle mountain blues and soft vanilla tones in the sky. These colors are harmonious with the dark wood of the church, avoiding any sharp or clashing transitions, thus enhancing the overall visual coherence and balance of the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the footprints on the snowy path subtle, evenly spaced, and aligned toward the entrance of the church, without appearing artificial or overly pronounced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowy path in Image B features subtle footprints that are discreetly embedded in the snow. They are evenly spaced and visibly oriented towards the entrance of the church, creating a naturalistic impression. The subtlety and alignment of the footprints contribute to a lifelike, understated effect rather than an exaggerated or unnatural appearance.",
