      "question": "Is the treasure chest still geometrically intact and proportionally consistent with its original form when placed on the newly added weathered map background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest appears as a well-rendered, three-dimensional object with careful attention to detail in its design and proportions. It is centrally positioned on the weathered map, maintaining its structural integrity with no apparent distortion or disproportion in its depiction. The chest has consistent coloring and shading in line with Image A, ensuring it fits naturally within both its original context and the added map background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ropes used as decorative borders maintain their natural fiber texture and realistic coil shapes without appearing stretched, flattened, or unnaturally contorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ropes in Image B as decorative borders retain a coiled appearance and exhibit a realistic texture that suggests natural fiber. Their form and texture do not show any signs of being stretched or distorted, which results in a natural and convincing visual effect. They are neatly arranged around the edges, enhancing the maritime theme without deviating from a believable presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the symbols and ancient-style text in the legend aligned properly with the overall lighting and depth of the image, and do they appear cleanly rendered without jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The symbols and ancient-style text in Image B are neatly placed within the frame of the map, demonstrating careful alignment with the image's lighting and depth. The rendering is clean, with smooth edges and clear separation from the background, ensuring no color bleeding or jagged appearances. This observation suggests high-quality post-processing to integrate these elements seamlessly with the overall scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the compass rose in the bottom-right corner have consistent metallic sheen and shadowing that aligns with the lighting direction and material properties of the surrounding gold coins and gems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass rose features a consistent metallic sheen and shadowing that closely aligns with the scene's lighting. This consistency can be observed in how the metallic parts of the compass reflect light similarly to the coins and gems near the treasure chest. This integration reflects a coherent approach to illustrating metallic materials under different lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sea monster motifs seamlessly blended into the map background, maintaining consistent line thickness and shading with the rest of the ink drawings, and do they not appear as disjointed or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea monster motifs in Image B are integrated smoothly into the map background, exhibiting consistent line thickness and shading that match the rest of the illustrated elements on the map. They do not stand out as separate or misplaced; instead, they enhance the historical nautical theme while maintaining visual harmony with the rest of the ink drawings.",
