    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shimmering mane formed from the water maintain fluid motion and transparency consistent with the original waterfall, without appearing solid or rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's mane appears solid and fluffy rather than maintaining the fluid motion and transparency of water seen in Image A. The mane has a more structured form akin to hair or feathers, whereas the original waterfall flows naturally over the rocks with no solid appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale patterns on the transformed rock body seamlessly integrated with the original stone texture, without visible seams, unnatural repetition, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's scales display a distinct pattern that contrasts with the irregular texture of the original rocks in Image A. The scales are uniform and glossy, differing from the rugged, varied surface of the rocks, indicating a transformation rather than seamless integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cloud wings formed from the foam extend naturally from the dragon’s body and align with the direction of water movement, without appearing detached or floating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows dragon's wings that appear fully formed and structured, unlike the foam from the water in Image A which lacks definition and form. The wings appear crafted from a different material rather than naturally extending from the foam, indicating detachment from the water's flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing blue runes embedded into the scales with smooth, diffused light emission and no sharp edges or unnatural brightness that disrupts the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features glowing blue runes that are smoothly embedded within the dragon's scales, exhibiting a cohesive diffused light that integrates well with the surrounding scale texture, without disrupting the natural appearance of the body.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon’s body and wings match the direction and intensity of natural sunlight in the original scene, without conflicting illumination or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts shadows and highlights on the dragon's body and wings that are consistent with a light source similar to natural sunlight portrayed in Image A. The illumination aligns logically with the position and strength of lighting evident in the original scene.",
