      "question": "Does the owl's head retain proper geometric proportions with a beak that aligns with the jawline and eyes that are symmetrically placed and shaped like those of a real owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl's head in Image B is stylized, resembling a cartoon character more than a realistic owl. Its eyes, while large and circular, are symmetrically placed, which is a common trait in cartoon illustrations to maintain a balanced appearance. The beak appears oversized and does not align directly with a realistic owl's jawline. Despite its stylization, the proportions serve the aesthetic purpose of the illustration and adhere to some semblance of symmetry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the cloak consistent in direction, shading, and density, and do they blend naturally with the original blue color without visible seams or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloak on the owl in Image B exhibits a consistent pattern in feather direction, shading, and density. The feathers are illustrated with uniformity, and the blue color appears solid without noticeable seams or pixelation, which is typical of well-rendered digital illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses resting securely on the beak with correct reflection and shadow placement, and do they match the size and style of typical reading glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glasses on the owl in Image B are positioned on its beak, as cartoon dimensions dictate, but they do not exhibit realistic reflection and shadow placement. They are oversized, consistent with the cartoon style but are not in line with the size and style of typical reading glasses in proportion to a real owl's anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand replaced with a wing-like structure that has logical joint placement and feather coverage, and does it lack extra fingers or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl characters do not possess a human-like hand but adhere to a wing-like structure appropriate for an illustrative design. The wings are logically structured with feathers and show no extra fingers or unnatural bends, maintaining a clean cartoon aesthetic.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed adjacent to the beak, contain legible text with contrasting colors, and do not overlap with other elements like the microphone or feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are positioned near the owl character, but the text is not fully legible as it seems to consist of jumbled or nonsensical letters that don't form coherent words. However, the bubbles do not overlap distracting elements and maintain a contrasting color for visibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branches extend from the background with natural tapering and bark texture, and are they positioned behind the subject without casting incorrect shadows or appearing flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B are part of the illustrated background, designed to complement the owl. They are placed behind the subject but lack the detailed bark texture and depth that mimic real branches. Instead, they present a flat appearance consistent with the cartoon style and do not incorrectly cast shadows.",
