      "question": "Does the cat maintain its structural coherence and natural texture, without showing any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no cat present; instead, there is a man on a horse set against a backdrop of a ruined city. This fundamental change means the question about the cat's integrity in terms of structural coherence and natural texture does not apply to this edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a man on a horse in front of a backdrop depicting a ruined city. The background appears consistent in style, with the textures and shading of the ruins blending well with the overall composition. There are no visible inconsistencies or disruptions in the integration of this background with the other elements.",

      "question": "Does the text “LAST RIDE” appear natural and appropriately styled, without introducing any distracting elements that could detract from the image's overall harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'LAST RIDE' in Image B is styled in a manner consistent with movie poster typography, complementing the genre often depicted in such visuals. The text is well-positioned and does not detract from the central subject of the horse and rider, maintaining harmony within the composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no cat; rather, there is a horse and rider set against a backdrop of ruins. The cool-tone filter is applied consistently across this image, contributing to a cohesive atmosphere that preserves the details in all visible elements, including the ruins and figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The film rating label in Image B is small and unobtrusive, positioned at the bottom corner where such labels are typically found. It complements the overall design and does not interfere with the focal points of the image, ensuring a natural fit within the composition.",
