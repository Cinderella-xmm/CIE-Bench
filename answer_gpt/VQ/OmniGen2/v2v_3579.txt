    "Question": "Q1: Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces forming the human figure, specifically the elevated arm, do not maintain a coherent structure. The arm is assembled using sushi pieces, but the transition from sushi to the arm's extremity introduces a plasticky hand which is inherently foreign to the material of sushi. This integration lacks coherence due to the juxtaposition of sushi with an unrealistic hand, indicating visible distortion.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses sushi pieces of various colors to form the human figure. The colors of the sushi pieces themselves—orange, greenery, and rice—align with the original plate's color palette. However, the plasticky hand is in an unnatural peach color that does not exist within the sushi spectrum, disrupting color consistency.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi map maintains a level of polish, visible clean edges and definition on sushi that aligns with quality standards. Both the sushi portions and the added arm, save for the plasticky hand, demonstrate sharp and defined contours, reflective of careful crafting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the expanded human figure with the lifted arm being formed with sushi pieces consistent in size with those in the rest of the map. The sushi scales harmoniously without any noticeable misproportion in the pieces; neither is there noticeable distortion compared to the sushi forming the rest of the map.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?",
    "explanation": "The lifted arm in Image B, starting with sushi pieces, seamlessly transitions into unnatural anatomical contribution—a peach-colored plasticky hand. This inclusion results in unnatural angles, diverging from any biologically plausible construction, given the mix of sushi materials with fixed arm's length.",
    "answer": "No"
