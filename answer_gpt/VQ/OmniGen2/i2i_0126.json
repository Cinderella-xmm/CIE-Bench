      "question": "Are the proportions of both characters consistent and free from distortion in their respective views within the combined illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the characters are depicted in a typical office setting with standard furniture proportions. The characters appear to be accurately proportioned, with their limbs and torso sizes appropriate and consistent across different views. In various sections, such as sitting and standing, the body proportions are harmonious and don’t display any obvious distortion or unnatural elongation/compression, suggesting a deliberate artistic consistency within the illustration.",

      "question": "Do the textures of the office elements such as chairs, plants, and desks appear natural and retain fine details without obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The office elements, including the chairs, desks, and plants, are rendered with smooth textures. While the style is more illustrative and vector-like, typical of digital illustrations, the elements maintain clear outlines and a clean appearance. There are no visible pixelation, distortions, or artifacts that disrupt the image’s aesthetic or readability, which indicates that the textures are appropriately preserved.",

      "question": "Are the computer screens realistic with sharp images, and does the interaction between the characters and screens appear natural without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The computer screens portrayed in the image display sharp, bright images that are consistent with a digital illustration style. The characters interact with the screens in a plausible manner, seated at desks, and the depth between them and the screens looks natural without any disproportions or visible digital artifacts that would detract from the overall realism.",

      "question": "Do the characters align correctly with their environment, maintaining a plausible spatial relationship and avoiding any broken geometric shapes or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters align smoothly with their environment, sitting and standing in a way that respects the perspective and spatial relationships of the scene. There are no visible issues such as broken geometric shapes, awkward placements, or misalignment between the characters and the furniture or surroundings. The environment and characters interact cohesively, facilitating a believable office atmosphere.",

      "question": "Does the lighting, including the hanging lamp’s shadow and the light on the characters, maintain consistency and contribute to the natural appearance of the scene without unnatural contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the office setting, including the hanging lamp and general ambient light, is depicted consistently across the image. The light falls uniformly on objects and characters, with shadows and highlights applied in a balanced manner. There are no glaring contrasts or discrepancies in lighting that would suggest an unnatural appearance, maintaining both depth and realism effectively.",
