    "Question": "Q1: Does the navy blue mesh pattern on the can maintain consistent texture density and alignment without visible warping or unnatural stretching?",
    "explanation": "The navy blue mesh pattern on Image B looks consistently dense and uniformly aligned over the shoe's surface. This indicates proper rendering in digital images, maintaining uniform density and alignment across the shoe without noticeable warping or stretching. Such patterns in digital media often require careful attention to textural detail to prevent warping or inconsistent appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the embossed lace textures evenly spaced and aligned around the can, without jagged edges or inconsistent depth that suggests digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "The laces in Image B are evenly spaced and appear straight and well-aligned. There's no noticeable jaggedness or inconsistency that would indicate digital artifacting, which often appears as rough edges or inconsistent shadows in digital images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the sole stripes wrap seamlessly around the lower half of the can, maintaining their shape and spacing without tearing or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The sole stripes in Image B are aligned and consistently proportioned, wrapping around the shoe without visible tearing or misalignment. In edited images, such consistency denotes careful attention to detail, avoiding common issues like warping or improper alignment during design adjustments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
