      "question": "Does the unfurled scroll form of the map maintain smooth, continuous curvature without jagged edges or distorted grid lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a map in the form of a scroll. The smoothness of the curvature can be assessed visually by examining the edges of the map and the pattern of the grid lines. The scroll in Image B appears to be smoothly curved, with the grid lines following the scroll's form without any noticeable jagged edges or distortion. This indicates a consistent representation of a scroll with continuous curvature.",

      "question": "Are the spokes of the ship's wheel evenly spaced, structurally intact, and consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the original compass material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shipâ€™s wheel is prominently displayed with visible spokes. World knowledge informs us that spokes are generally evenly spaced for structural integrity. They appear evenly spaced in Image B and maintain a consistent thickness. The metallic texture is similar to the compass in both color and surface finish, suggesting continuity in materials.",

      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of two explorers in a small boat are visible. These silhouettes are proportionally small compared to the map's scale, consistent with the depiction of wide area maps. They are placed along a path suggested by the red dotted lines, indicating potential travel routes. Their placement does not interfere with major geographical labels, preserving the map's readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography aligned with the vintage aesthetic, free from pixelation or blurring, and positioned so that it does not obscure major elements such as the compass or continental outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features typography that is styled in a manner consistent with vintage aesthetics, using serif fonts and decorative elements. The text is clear, without any pixelation or blurring, which suggests high-quality rendering. Additionally, it is positioned to avoid obscuring critical map elements, such as the wheel or geographical outlines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Red dotted lines on Image B suggest travel routes across the map. These lines form continuous paths that do not overlap and are consistent with exploration paths, avoiding major landmasses and strategic symbols on the map. This reflects a well-considered layout that aligns with typical historical maps showing exploration routes.",
