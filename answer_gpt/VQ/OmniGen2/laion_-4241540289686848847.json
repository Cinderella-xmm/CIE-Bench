        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon observing the long silver hair, it appears to flow naturally downwards with a smooth texture. The strands do not clump together, nor do they float in an unrealistic manner. There are no visible seams or rendering artifacts that disrupt the natural look of the hair. This indicates careful attention to detail and rendering quality, achieving a realistic depiction of hair movement.",
