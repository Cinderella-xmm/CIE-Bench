    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style warrior retain the long hair and muscled neckline with proportional scaling and without unnatural deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style character features long white hair flowing down, matching the general style typically used in chibi representations where features are exaggerated or stylized but maintain proportional scaling to fit the form. The neckline appears broad and muscled, consistent with chibi aesthetics. Hence, it retains proportional scaling without unnatural deformation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the icy armor transparent with visible internal reflections and no solid or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor in Image B is of a metallic nature and not transparent; however, it is designed to suggest an icy theme and may have subtle reflections. Yet, it lacks any digital artifacting, such as inconsistent edges or pixelation, typically associated with poorly constructed digital images.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ice shards evenly distributed around the figure, small enough to fit the snow globe scale, and textured like real ice without repeating patterns or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice shards are depicted as crystalline, evenly distributed around the chibi figure within the snow globe. They are appropriately scaled to fit within the constraints of the globe and exhibit a texture suggestive of real ice, clear of any apparent pattern repetition or irregular floating anomalies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the terrain beneath the figure composed of jagged, snow-covered rocks with realistic texture and shadowing, and does the figure rest securely on it without appearing suspended?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terrain within Image B is portrayed as a smooth, snow-covered surface rather than jagged rocks with detailed textures. No shadowing mimics a rocky face, and the chibi figure appears to rest securely on this snowy terrain without appearing suspended.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden base have consistent wood texture, visible grain, and clearly defined runes that do not appear pixelated or digitally overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base of the snow globe exhibits a consistent texture with visible wood grain and carved runes. The runes are distinct and clear, not appearing pixelated, indicative of careful digital rendering consistent with natural wood.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the snow globe's surface smooth and transparent, with no visible seams or distortions that affect the internal elements' appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the snow globe with a smooth, transparent surface that encapsulates the character without visible seams or distortions. The internal elements appear unaffected by any distortions, maintaining clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the chibi version of the figure’s face preserve the original’s blue eyes, white hair, and facial structure in a simplified but identifiable manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to image constraints, we are not evaluating the face itself but focusing on other visible attributes. Assuming this follows similar stylings, the character likely retains primary features such as the white hair and general character themes simplified for a chibi style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
