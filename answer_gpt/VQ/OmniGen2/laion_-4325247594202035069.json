    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each figure has a surface that resembles soft fabric, characterized by smooth textures and consistent bold colors without any visible pixelation or artificial textures. The blue, green, red, and yellow colors are clear and non-repetitive, giving the impression of toy or plush-like objects.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are transformed to have exaggerated fins and tails instead of arms and legs. Their poses remain dynamic and proportional, without any signs of broken geometry or unnatural bends, suggesting careful modifications.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the weapons appear to have been transformed into various fish-like features connected to the figures. They integrate seamlessly, maintaining physical logic without any misalignments or floating components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a sandy fabric-like texture with subtle depth and shading. The figures are positioned naturally upon this surface, with no apparent floating or clipping issues, contributing to a coherent scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures do not have visible hands in terms of fingers or grips as all limbs are transformed into fins or tails seamlessly, rendering the question about fingers inapplicable in this context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
