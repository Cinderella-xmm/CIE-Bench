      "question": "Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke effect around the gymnast creates a soft edge that does not interfere with the clear definition of the figure's outline. The limbs, head, and torso are clearly visible and well-defined, indicating the brushstroke does not disrupt the figure's silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the gymnast appear realistic. Each hand has five fingers, and they are positioned naturally with accurate joint alignment. The depiction of skin texture, though stylized, maintains a natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elongated legs form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet without abrupt bends or discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the gymnast's leg forming a long, continuous curve from the hip to the foot, consistent with a graceful pose typical in gymnastics. The lack of any abrupt bends or discontinuities in the line suggests continuity and fluidity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blue and silver gradients smoothly blended across the leotard and skin, without visible banding or unnatural highlights?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blending of gradients in the leotard and skin appears smooth with no obvious banding or harsh transitions. The colors are integrated in a way that looks natural, capturing the highlights characteristic of gymnastic leotards.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features swirling ribbons and stars around the gymnast, strategically placed to enhance the sense of movement. They do not intersect with the body or the balance beam, maintaining clear separation and contributing to the overall dynamic composition.",
