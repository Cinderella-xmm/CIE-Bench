    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the luminescent ferns in the canopy have consistent, organic shapes and smooth gradients that resemble real plant growth patterns without pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent ferns in the canopy display a vibrant coloration that mimics the organic growth patterns typical in nature. The edges of these ferns are smooth and exhibit natural gradients, suggesting a realistic representation without pixelation or jagged edges.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver tribal patterns on the bark aligned with the natural contours of the trunk and free from floating, misaligned, or unnaturally sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver tribal patterns on the bark follow the contours of the trunk, enhancing the natural shape of the tree without misalignment or floating elements. The edges of these patterns are smooth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the translucent wings extending from the canopy smoothly connected to the treeâ€™s branches, showing gradual transparency and consistent layering without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The translucent wings are connected to the canopy in a seamless manner, exhibiting a gradual transparency that gives them a layered look. There are no visible seams or geometric distortions, ensuring a cohesive appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glass-like fibers forming the trunk exhibit realistic light refraction, consistent thickness variation, and continuous flow without abrupt breaks or unnatural twists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass-like fibers forming the trunk show realistic light refraction and a consistent variation in thickness that contributes to a natural-look. They flow continuously without abrupt breaks or unnatural twists.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils extend from the tree base into the ground with smooth curvature and consistent luminosity, without intersecting the grass unnaturally or showing flat, non-continuous surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing tendrils extend smoothly from the base into the ground, maintaining a consistent luminosity and curvature. They integrate naturally with the surroundings and do not incongruously intersect the grass or display flat surfaces.",
