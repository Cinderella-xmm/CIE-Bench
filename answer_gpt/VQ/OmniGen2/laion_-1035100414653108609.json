    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tusks of the warthog appear to have a moss texture added. The texture follows the natural curvature of the tusks, which suggests that the moss has been applied with consideration to the original shape of the tusks. Furthermore, the lighting direction in the image appears consistent, with shadows cast appropriately according to the light source. This suggests that the shadows align with the curvature of the tusks and moss texture present on them.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the waterfall-like mane flow continuously from the top of the head downward without intersecting or distorting the snout or ear regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues in Image B, the mane resembles a waterfall made up of leaves, cascading down the warthog's head. This design flows smoothly from the top of the head downwards, maintaining distinct separation from the snout and ear regions. It does not intersect or cause any visible distortion to these areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaf-styled patterns aligned with the natural folds and contours of the warthog’s body, avoiding abrupt edges or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features leaf-styled patterns that conform to the warthog’s body contours smoothly. These patterns seem to follow the natural shape of the body, avoiding any abrupt edges or misalignment. The leaf patterns contribute to a harmonious and coherent look, respecting the bodily structure of the warthog.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fungi positioned along the spine and upper back without overlapping legs or protruding unnaturally into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, fungi elements are integrated along the spine and upper back. Their placement respects the anatomical layout of the warthog, ensuring no overlap with the legs or unnatural protrusions into the air. This indicates a careful design intention to align these elements with the body structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing eyes remain within the eye sockets, preserving the shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing eyes in Image B maintain their position within the eye sockets. They preserve the natural shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features, suggesting that the design considers anatomical accuracy to prevent distortion. This approach helps retain the warthog's visual integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branch-shaped hooves connect naturally to the lower legs and maintain consistent joint alignment without breaking the leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warthog is depicted with branch-shaped hooves that connect seamlessly to the lower legs. The integration respects the anatomical joint structure, maintaining consistent alignment without any breaks or disruption to the leg form. This creates a natural and cohesive appearance.",
