      "question": "Does the word \"warm\" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'warm' is prominent and bold in the top left corner of the image. It is clearly superimposed on the painting and has a sharp contrast in both color and style, which stands out against the natural landscape depicted in the painting. Thus, it disrupts the natural appearance and introduces a texture that is different from the existing visual elements, making it appear added and not seamlessly integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the addition of the word \"warm\" at the top left corner maintained the structural consistency of surrounding elements like the sofa and cushions, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of the word 'warm' at the top left corner is confined to the painting. Since this area does not intersect or overlap with structural elements like the sofa and cushions, it does not cause any distortion to those elements. The surroundings remain consistent and unaffected by the addition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the size and font of the word \"warm\" maintain visual plausibility and authentic integration with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'warm' is large and in a bold font, which makes it stand out significantly against the background art of the painting. The size and font choice do not blend naturally with the existing elements and look more like an overlay. This contrast diminishes the visual plausibility of being authentically integrated within the environment of the painting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner added in a manner that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'freedom' is placed on the floor area where it is both noticeable and unobtrusive. The flooring and nearby plant details remain clear and undistorted, showing no loss of detail or visible artifacts caused by the addition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner respect the structural integrity of nearby elements, such as the corner of the rug and plant pot base, without causing any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'freedom' is positioned in a way that does not interfere with the visible boundaries and structure of nearby elements like the edge of the rug and the base of the plant pot. This placement respects the existing details and maintains the overall structural integrity of those areas.",
