      "question": "Do the zebras maintain their signature striped coats with no unnatural texture or loss of detail in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras' coats are designed with the characters' classic black and white stripes maintained, but they exhibit a smoother texture more aligned with a chibi-style 3D art, differing from the realistic details that zebras usually have. Chibi art often simplifies details to create a more stylized look, which includes a reduction in texture detail compared to real-life images.",

      "question": "Are the lush green field and fencing preserved in a photorealistic manner without any visible distortion or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the field and fencing appear more cartoon-like or artificial, with vibrant and uniform color tones characteristic of chibi-style settings, which lack the natural gradient, texture, and imperfection seen in photorealistic images like those in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the zebras retain their realistic grazing stances without any distortion or deformation in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the 3D style transformation, the zebras in Image B are still in a naturalistic grazing posture, capturing the essence of the real stance without significant distortion. This suggests an accurate representation of their positions, differentiated only by chibi-style aesthetic rather than any pose alteration.",

      "question": "Does the ornate decorative photo frame integrate seamlessly with the scene without disrupting the visual coherence or introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate frame in Image B does not integrate seamlessly with the rest of the scene. Instead, it highlights that the central image is of a particular style, possibly suggesting a separation or distinction from the surroundings, interrupting any attempt at visual continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the photorealistic background smooth and believable without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the background in Image B presents a stylistic contrast. While the zebras maintain a chibi aesthetic, the background is more photorealistic, leading to a visible inconsistency in style and texture, making the transition less smooth.",
