      "question": "Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the character are highly exaggerated, deviating from natural anatomical proportions. The muscle groups are so significantly inflated that they do not follow the natural contours and joint alignment observed in human anatomy. Such exaggeration is common in caricature or cartoon style, which often exaggerates features for artistic or humorous effect rather than anatomical accuracy.",

      "question": "Are the gym-themed motifs on the tank top and shorts clearly rendered with consistent material properties and no overlapping or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motifs on the tank top appear clear with a stylized design consistent with cartoon or comic art styles. The materials and textures in the edited image are uniformly rendered, with clear outlines and bold colors indicative of digital illustration styles. There are no signs of overlapping or fragmented textures, suggesting a clear depiction with consistent material properties.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the barâ€™s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful icons below the barbell, seemingly representing weights, are placed in a symmetrical manner along both sides of the barbell. However, they do not perfectly align with the bar's axis since they are placed on the frame and background rather than the barbell itself. These icons are used primarily for decorative purposes and are not intended to appear as attached weights.",

      "question": "Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a framed artwork and does not feature mirror reflections or shadow illustrations, unlike Image A. Therefore, there is no aspect of mirrored shadows or reflections to evaluate for lighting direction and depth in Image B. This question does not apply to the context and structure of Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar strip is placed at the bottom of the frame and is aligned horizontally, fitting well with the dimensions of the panel. It appears appropriately sized in relation to the proportions of the figure and the surrounding elements within the artwork, consistent with the overall design and presentation.",
