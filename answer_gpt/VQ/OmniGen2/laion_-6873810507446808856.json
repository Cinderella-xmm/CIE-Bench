      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes added to the pancake surfaces positioned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the size and shape of the pancakes, without deforming the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pancakes have been anthropomorphized with faces, which include eyes placed on top. These eyes are positioned centrally and symmetrically on each pancake surface, following the general shape and size of the pancakes. There is no visible distortion in the surrounding pancake texture, indicating a careful addition that preserves the original structure and texture. The cartoon-style design is consistent with the playful theme, and symmetry is commonly used in illustrations to maintain visual appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butter pat still recognizable as a solid block with clean edges and natural lighting, even after being stylized as a hat, without exhibiting warped or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butter pat seen in Image A has been creatively stylized into a hat for the anthropomorphic pancakes. Despite this creative alteration, the butter is illustrated with clean lines and definitive edges, typical of cartoon styles, maintaining its shape and being consistently lit. This reflects common artistic practice where elements are transformed but not distorted in cartoons.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream extend downward from the pancake stack in a continuous, smooth arc without abrupt breaks, pixelation, or unnatural viscosity that contradicts liquid behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has transformed the syrup into a part of the pancake's clothing, but when considering the syrup as traditionally streamed, Image B does not have a visible syrup stream extending in the traditional sense. Any representation of syrup in the image aligns with cartoon conventions where exaggeration and alteration are part of the aesthetic, rather than aiming for realistic fluid behavior.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added breakfast items (e.g., coffee cups, scrambled eggs) aligned with the depth and lighting of the original scene, maintaining consistent shadows and scale relative to the pancake stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the breakfast items are drawn in a cartoonish style, which diverges from realism but maintains a coherent visual relationship with the pancake stack. The items have consistent lighting typical of cartoon illustrations and appear appropriately scaled within the stylized scene. Cartoon illustrations often do not adhere to natural shadow casting or depth perception as their style focuses on simplicity and exaggeration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles and text boxes positioned in open areas of the frame without overlapping critical elements such as the pancake stack or syrup stream, and do they have clear, legible letterforms without jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are positioned above the pancakes, in areas where they do not obscure important visual elements like the pancakes themselves. The text within the bubbles is legible with smooth letterforms suitable for a cartoon environment. Speech bubbles and their placement are carefully managed in illustrations to ensure clarity and minimize disruption of the main subjects.",
