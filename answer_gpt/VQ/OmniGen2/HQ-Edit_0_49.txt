    "Question": "Q1: Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is seen enclosed within a glass dome alongside cups, suggesting a smaller scale than in Image A where it stands alone. This setup implies it has been proportionally scaled down to fit inside the dome. The teapot in Image B maintains its intricate engravings, structural coherence, and shape, consistent with Image A, thus indicating a proportional scaling down while preserving its original features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the porcelain cups are meticulously arranged around the base of the teapot within the dome. They demonstrate a balanced spacing without overlapping, and the visual cues suggest realistic ceramic material, evidenced by their smooth surface finish, appropriate reflections, and shadows within the lighting context provided by the dome enclosure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the new engravings on the elevated surface match the existing decorative patterns in style and depth, without appearing pixelated, duplicated, or unnaturally enhanced?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the teapot retains consistent decorative patterns similar to those in Image A. The engravings appear intricate and match the established style, without evidence of pixelation or unnatural enhancement. The style coherence between existing and any new engravings indicate an attention to detail ensuring stylistic and depth unity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the steam spirals rise smoothly from the teapot’s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft edges, proper translucency, and consistent lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the steam spirals are seen elegantly rising above the teapot’s spout and lid, demonstrating smooth curves and transitions. They have soft edges and exhibit translucency, which interacts well with the surrounding lighting, maintaining a realistic representation of steam. The spirals' consistent interaction with light enhances the plausible depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome show accurate light refraction and surface reflections, allowing clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without visual distortion or artificial glare?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the teapot encased within a glass dome, and the teapot alongside the porcelain cups is clearly visible without distortion. The glass dome exhibits accurate light refraction and reflections, avoiding artificial glare while ensuring transparency. The visibility is seamless, and the reflections are consistent with real-world glass properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"
