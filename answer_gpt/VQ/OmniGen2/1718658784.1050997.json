      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cake’s icing display bold, graphic patterns that are evenly distributed and free from distorted textures or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake icing is illustrated with broad, repetitive stripes that resemble cartoon-like illustrations. This design is consistent, with each stripe being evenly spaced and follows simple geometric patterns without any interruptions or distortions. The essence of bold, graphic patterns is maintained through the consistent application of clear lines without textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloons represented as uniform monochrome dots that maintain their original spherical form and clustered grouping without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are depicted as solid color circles with a clean, monochromatic finish. Each retains a perfect spherical shape and are grouped closely, consistent with an illustration style emphasizing uniformity and simplicity. This differs from realistic texture representation, ensuring no distortions are present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the table and vase been converted into solid, contrasting color blocks with sharp, clean edges and no residual textures or blending artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and vase are illustrated with solid colors that are entirely filled, free from any textural detail or gradient blending. The edges are sharp and distinctly defined in a style that highlights their geometric forms without any residual textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the candle flame feature exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues while remaining attached to the wick and showing an upward directional flow without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candle flame is depicted with sharp, stylized lines, accentuating its presence through exaggerated bright hues typical of cartoonish representation, maintaining its attachment to the wick. The flame’s direction is upward, coherent with physical laws and giving a sense of movement without misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements positioned consistently within the scene’s depth and perspective, with no floating or misplaced components relative to the table and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements such as the cake, balloons, vase, and bowls are positioned with a clear sense of perspective. Each item sits grounded on its respective surfaces, maintaining coherent depth within the scene, consistent with the perspective despite the flat graphic style, avoiding floating or misplacement.",
