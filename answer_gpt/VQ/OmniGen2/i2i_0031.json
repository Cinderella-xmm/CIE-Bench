      "question": "Are the simplified lifeguard tower and rescue vehicle icons free of unnatural textures and maintain their original key features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire image is a blank white space, indicating that there are no visual details, textures, or features of any kind present to assess. Since the image cannot provide any information about lifeguard towers, rescue vehicles, or any other objects and icons, it's impossible to determine whether any features or textures have been preserved or appear unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the minimalist safety icons retain proper proportions and avoid broken geometric shapes when compared to surrounding elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is completely blank, offering no visual information or elements to evaluate geometric shapes, proportions, or any related comparisons. Because there are no visible objects in Image B, it's impossible to judge the proportions or the integrity of any shapes in relation to surrounding elements.",

      "question": "Are the minimalist icons integrated seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall visual plausibility and authenticity of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible elements, icons, or scenes to evaluate. The blankness of the image suggests a lack of integration of any kind, as there are no objects or scenes to integrate or assess for visual plausibility or authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition from detailed objects to minimalist icons result in a clean representation without degrading fine details or introducing visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely white with no details or visual noise, thus offering no basis for evaluating a transition from detailed objects to minimalist icons. There are neither detailed objects nor minimalist representations visible to make such a comparative assessment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the minimalist safety icons exhibit clean edges and distinct color blocks consistent with airport signage styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is completely blank, there are no icons or other visual elements to evaluate for cleanliness of edges or color consistency. Without any visual data, it's not feasible to determine adherence to any styling, including airport signage styles.",
