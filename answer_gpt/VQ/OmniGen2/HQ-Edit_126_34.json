      "question": "Are the edges of the cabinâ€™s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's roof is distinctly triangular, and the walls and windows follow a consistent rectangular geometry. The brushwork does not distort these shapes, maintaining a clear and orderly structure. This demonstrates the artist's capability to use brushstrokes for effect while preserving geometric consistency. Comparing to Image A, where details are sharper, the logic holds as both images adhere to the basic principles of structure regardless of detailing differences.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees stand vertically, retaining traditional conical shapes associated with firs. The brushstrokes suggest layering of the foliage, capturing the essence of tree structure typically found in snowy landscapes. This visual attribute aligns with common knowledge that firs maintain upright and layered foliage regardless of artistic style. Against Image A, despite greater detail, the structural integrity of the trees is preserved in both.",

      "question": "Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke rises vertically from the chimney, softening outward to illustrate natural diffusion. This depiction matches the typical pattern of smoke behavior in cold, dense air where it ascends straightly before dispersing. Contrasted with Image A, which also conveys realistic smoke movement, Image B effectively captures this aspect using stylized brushwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows snow blanketing the roof, ground, and tree branches with consistent texture and distribution. This implies a realistic accumulation as expected in snowy conditions. The brushwork introduces texture variation but aligns with typical snow layering. Image A provides a more detailed depiction; however, the uniformity is apparent in both images, supporting the realistic representation of snowfall.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illumination is integrated softly within the composition, with gentle transitions from lights to surrounding elements. The brushwork maintains stylistic consistency, avoiding sharp contrasts or exaggerated glow effects. Image A features more precise lighting effects; nonetheless, both uphold subtlety, preserving harmony and warmth typical in such scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of elements adheres to spatial depth principles, with the small trees and fence visually closer compared to the midground cabin and the distant trees. This spatial logic enhances scene depth and realism, mirroring general perspective rules. Comparing with Image A, while detail levels differ, the spatial organization is consistent in both images, reinforcing visual coherence.",
