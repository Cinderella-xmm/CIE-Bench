    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kneeling figure on the left has hands where each hand realistically features five fingers. The fingers are positioned in a manner that looks natural for a character in a dynamic pose, with no evident distortion or unnatural joint movement, reflecting typical character design where anatomical accuracy enhances believability.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the main leaping figure's legs and torso are depicted in a dynamic pose suggestive of forward momentum. The limbs exhibit correct proportion and alignment consistent with leaping action, which maintains anatomical accuracy without warp or broken appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaping figure demonstrates a tight tuck of the knees toward the chest, indicating a powerful leap. The muscles maintain natural contours and there is no visible deformation, ensuring that the leap captures the dynamic sense of motion typical in such poses.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits smooth bold outlines along the figure's contours, enhancing visual clarity while ensuring no jagged edges are present. The edges are well-defined and colors are contained within their respective areas without spillage, contributing to a clean and coherent presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of text captions and step numbers avoid intersecting or obscuring key elements such as the main figure's limbs or facial features, thereby maintaining focus on the figure itself and enhancing readability without interference.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The simplified figures in Image B are scaled and aligned well, consistent with the proportions of the original character. They maintain perspective accuracy, ensuring both visual coherence and instructional clarity in demonstrating the steps portrayed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
