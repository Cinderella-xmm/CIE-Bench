      "question": "Are Mona Lisa's facial features, such as her eyes, nose, mouth, and smile, rendered naturally without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, although the face is blurred, the features that are not covered, like the hairstyle, transition smoothly into the background without introducing obvious artifacts, indicating that if the face weren't blurred, other features would likely retain natural rendering.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the edited background in Studio Ghibli style retain its visual plausibility and avoid breaking the geometric shapes seen in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image employs Studio Ghibli aesthetics, characterized by bright colors and simplistic shapes, while maintaining the essential landscape elements like water, mountains, and road paths. This retains the geometric balance of the composition.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in the edited image transitions from realistic textures to a simplified, flat color style typical of animations. While deviating from realism, it maintains a level of realism fitting within a cartoon universe, avoiding unnatural patterns.",
