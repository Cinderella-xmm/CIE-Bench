      "question": "Does the right-side skier maintain a natural texture and appearance without visible artifacts where he appears to slide out of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier appears to slide out of the image due to the editing effect. Observing the region around the skier, there are no noticeable artifacts or disruptions in texture that would suggest an unnatural appearance. The background snow and skier's clothing transition smoothly without any abrupt changes in texture. Therefore, the skier maintains a natural appearance in this context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural bending in the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the geometric shapes of the right-side skier, including the body, ski poles, and skis, remain consistent and do not appear distorted or unnaturally bent. The proportions and angles of the skis and poles align with the expected posture of someone skiing, indicating that the geometric shapes have been preserved well.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shadow cast by the right-side skier remain consistent with the light source and appear naturally elongated or altered appropriately due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadow of the right-side skier in Image B is consistent with the direction of the sunlight coming from the top left, as indicated by the light and shade in the overall image. The shadow appears appropriately aligned with the skier's position and the light source, and while it might be slightly elongated due to the perspective and movement, it does not appear artificially altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow texture around the right-side skier smooth and uninterrupted, without showing signs of unnatural blending or disruption from the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow texture around the right-side skier appears smooth and continuous, with no signs of unnatural blending or disruptions caused by the sliding effect. The powdery snow shows the typical cloud of snow one would expect from a skier moving at speed, indicating that the texture is well-preserved and natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details on the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis remain sharp and clear, without any blurring or loss of detail due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis in Image B appear sharp and detailed, consistent with other well-focused elements of the scene. There is no evident blurring or loss of detail attributable to the sliding effect; instead, the skier's attire and equipment maintain clarity.",
