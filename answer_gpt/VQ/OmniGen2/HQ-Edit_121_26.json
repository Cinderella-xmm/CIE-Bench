      "question": "Does the ornate armor on the character's torso and limbs have consistent geometric structure and natural surface textures without visible distortion or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor worn by the character is analyzed for its geometric structure and textures. The armor appears to be well-designed with smooth lines and curves that follow the character's body shape accurately. The surface texture of the armor looks metallic, consistent with real-life aesthetics, and there are no visible jagged edges or distortions in the rendering of the armor's surface.",

      "question": "Is the gem-studded scepter proportionally accurate and physically plausible in size and shape relative to the character’s hand, with no distorted or misaligned gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scepter in Image B is analyzed based on its size and shape relative to the character's hand. It holds a large gem at its top with intricate designs and appears consistent with the image's theme. The gemstones seem proportionally set and evenly aligned. The depiction shows the scepter fitting well within the character’s grasp, indicating plausibility in size and positioning.",

      "question": "Does the velvet cape exhibit natural draping behavior with realistic folds and shadows, and does it avoid unnatural intersections or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet cape can be seen flowing behind the character. It displays natural draping with folds that appear realistic and are consistent with lighting conditions. The shadows are appropriately cast, enhancing the texture and realism of the cape. There are no visually awkward intersections or segments that appear to float or are disconnected from the character.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the rolling hills and distant castle integrated smoothly into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow alignment, avoiding sharp edges or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the background in Image B, the rolling hills and castle are smoothly integrated into the scene. The lighting appears consistent throughout the landscape, with shadows properly aligning with the direction of light. The transition between elements is seamless, avoiding any abrupt changes in color or texture, which contributes to a coherent visual scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character’s right hand holding the scepter show five correctly shaped fingers with natural joint alignment and skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character’s right hand in Image B is examined for anatomical accuracy. The hand gripping the scepter shows five distinctly shaped fingers with natural alignment. The joints appear correctly positioned, and the skin texture looks realistic without any signs of anatomical distortion or the presence of extra digits.",
