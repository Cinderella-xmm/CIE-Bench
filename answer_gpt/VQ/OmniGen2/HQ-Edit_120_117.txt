    "Question": "Q1: Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the outer surface of the globe appears perfectly spherical and smooth, consistent with designs meant to mimic a glass globe. The visual cues, such as reflections and shading, suggest an even, uninterrupted curvature consistent with a polished, smooth surface. Without jagged edges or irregularities, it maintains the characteristics of a typical globe's exterior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighthouse has clear structural elements like a cylindrical shape, a tapering top, and a red dome. The window placements appear evenly distributed, and the design is neatly symmetrical. Comparing to Image A, where the lighthouse's design features include uniformly spaced windows and symmetrical architecture, Image B maintains these features accurately within the constraints of its miniature format.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the waves depicted in the globe show a smooth texture, characterized by a clean, flowing design that simulates the fluidity of water. The translucent blue appearance provides subtle reflections, avoiding any blocky or fragmented impressions. This aligns with the expected properties of materials like resin, which are crafted to mimic water aesthetically.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base supports the globe effectively, appearing flat and level. The grain of the wood is visible and natural-looking, complemented by engraved lines that form a radial pattern centered around the base. These engravings are clean and follow a consistent design logic, reflecting typical craftsmanship in globes with wooden mounts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds and mountains form a background layer that supports the perception of depth, commonly used in artistic representations to provide context. The globe remains the focal point without any overlapping occurring between its surface and the painted elements, maintaining perspective and ensuring objects stay in their spatial positions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene inside the globe uses a color palette that includes earthy browns and greens for the rocks and vibrant blues for the water. These hues are carefully chosen to complement one another, with gradient shading in the water enhancing the visual depth and fidelity to natural scenes. The consistent use of color harmonizes elements within the scene, resulting in a cohesive aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
