      "question": "Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a gown with intricate brocade patterns, and the fabric's behavior appears consistent with the traditional kimono design. The sleeves and skirt of the gown have visible folds that create volume, mimicking the natural flow and structure of heavy brocade fabric. Common knowledge regarding clothing design supports the conclusion that such fabric should exhibit natural folds, given its thickness and weight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rose blossoms show variation in color, size, and shape, which are typical traits in natural rose arrangements. The lighting affects the petals appropriately, and there's no visible duplication that usually results from digital manipulation. These observations reflect natural rose placement when considering traditional garden scenes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows gazebos and statues with detailed line work that aligns well with the focal perspective. The shadows are cast consistent with the direction of light visible from the trees and the overall setting, aligning spatially with the ground plane, which confirms realistic architectural placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the woman's left and right hands with anatomically correct finger arrangements and realistic contact on the violin and bow. There aren't additional fingers, and the joints appear naturally curved, showcasing proper human anatomy knowledge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains detailed consistency in the brocade patterns, metalwork of the gazebo, and stone texture of the statues without noticeable pixelation or repetitive tiling. Such fine details are crucial for high-resolution images to mimic realistic craftsmanship. The intricate details align with expectations for high-quality renditions of fabric and architecture.",
