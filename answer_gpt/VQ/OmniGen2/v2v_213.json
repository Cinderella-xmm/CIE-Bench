      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly retain their natural texture and pattern without any visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings appear to have a simplified texture and pattern. The patterns are more stylized and lack the detailed intricacies present in natural butterfly wings. The texture also appears smoother and more artificial, consistent with a 3D rendering rather than a natural organism's texture. By comparing this with common knowledge of butterfly wing patterns, which are usually complex and detailed, it is clear that the natural texture is not retained.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the butterfly's body and wings consistent with its natural form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the butterfly's body and wings are quite precise and symmetric, which aligns with the natural form of a butterfly. The body and wings are evenly sized and positioned, adhering to the expected natural anatomy of a butterfly. This suggests a deliberate effort to replicate the butterfly's form without any obvious distortion or unnatural deformation, even though the stylization is evident.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and shading on the butterfly in the 3D model appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shading on the butterfly appear somewhat artificial, which is typical of a 3D model. The shadows are well-defined and consistent with a directed lighting source, but they lack the subtlety found in Image A's natural lighting, where shadows would generally diffuse more gradually. The uniformity of shading in the 3D model contrasts with the nuanced variations in natural settings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the patterns on the wings and the texture of the body, been preserved without any loss or distortion in the 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fine details of the butterfly, such as the wing patterns and body texture, appear simplified compared to natural butterfly features. The patterns on the wings are more geometric and less intricate, and the body's texture is smoother. This indicates a loss of the fine, complex details typically present in real butterflies.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and placement of the butterfly in the 3D model appear visually plausible and coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of the butterfly on the table edge is consistent and visually coherent. The butterfly's position mirrors a realistic pose it might take if it were resting on a surface. The table and background provide a sufficient context that supports the butterfly's placement in the scene, making the composition appear plausible.",
