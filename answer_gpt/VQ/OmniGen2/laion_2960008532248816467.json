      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile on the tart are drawn as part of a cartoon-like face. The visual cues indicate consistent coloring and style with the surrounding custard. The presence of smoothness and uniformity in color suggests a coherent design consistent with common illustrations. There is no evidence of jagged edges or unnatural disturbances, which are often noticeable in poorly edited images. Therefore, it appears seamless and appropriately integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features creatures sitting on the rim of the tart. They are proportionally small compared to the tart, suggesting a deliberate design choice to enhance cuteness. The alignment with the curve follows perspective rules, and the textures appear soft and consistent with digital cartoon art. No pixelation or clipping artifacts are visible, which are common signs of low-quality edits.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a path swirls around the tart and extends into the background. It is depicted with proper perspective to guide the viewer's eye into the depths of the forest scene. The edges of the path are smooth, with no sharp discontinuities or isolated floating segments. Consistent shading throughout the path indicates an understanding of light and depth, common in cohesive artistic designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tartâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foliage and flowers are arranged around the tart to create a lush, immersive forest setting. They appear to be placed at a reasonable distance, enhancing depth without encroaching on the tart itself. The application of shadows adds dimension, while their careful positioning avoids clipping or overlapping errors that might disrupt the scene's continuity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts only one tart with alterations to include a face and cartoon creatures. Original characteristics like shape, layered structure, and glaze are replaced by a simplified, stylized representation. Since these changes depart significantly from any original structure and layers, and there's only one tart represented, the image does not maintain the integrity of the original format.",
