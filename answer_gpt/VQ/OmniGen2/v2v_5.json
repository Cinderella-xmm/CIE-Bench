      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes on the chibi character appear consistent with the original pattern without unnatural distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi zebra character has stripes that follow a coherent pattern reminiscent of a real zebra, which reflects intentional design without awkward transitions or breaks. Through examining stripes often associated with zebras, which are typically clean and distinct, we can confirm they are suitably aligned. Comparing to Image A, while the stripes are less detailed in Image B due to the chibi style, there is no significant distortion or loss of detail in the pattern itself.",

      "question": "Does the chibi zebra's interaction with the miniature cake appear natural and free from any obvious artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi zebra is posed with its snout close to the cake, mimicking an interaction without visible issues like misalignment or awkward shading. The cake is proportionally scaled to the chibi zebra, creating a playful and credible scene. This presentation is visually aligned with the character design, which often involves stylized interactions. Comparing to Image A, where the zebra is naturally interacting with a cake, the chibi version keeps a consistent interaction style without distortion.",

      "question": "Is the chibi zebra seated on the edge of the Instagram frame in a way that appears structurally coherent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi zebra is positioned near the bottom of the Instagram-style frame with a proper fit into the scene. Although stylized, the structure and positioning make visual sense and maintain balance within the image components. The character's seating appears coherent given the aesthetic, which is aligned with typical placements in social media contexts.",

      "question": "Does the inclusion of the username \"ZebraLover\" and social media icons blend seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, factors like the bold 'ZebraLover' username and additional icons are harmoniously integrated into the Instagram-style frame. Despite added textual layers, the compilation bears the hallmark of cohesive digital design. The visual blend between decorative elements and the patterned framing along with the digitally stylized zebra maintains a natural appearance within the intended stylistic setting. These do not conflict with the chibi zebra's presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the materials used for the chibi zebra and the cake natural in appearance, without any obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows materials crafted with artificial charm, featuring a digital art style, yet they manage to imitate texture sufficiently for thematic coherence. The chibi zebra and cake texture aligns with smooth designs that are typical in character modeling, lending a consistent aesthetic that doesn't introduce overt unnaturalness. This differs from Image A where real-world textures are present, but the chibi design in B remains faithful to typical chibi character representation.",
