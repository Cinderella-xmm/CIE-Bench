      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or breaks in the car's bodywork where the different views meet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B presents two different views of a car, side and top. The car's bodywork, especially where different perspectives meet, should ideally have smooth transitions without any visible breaks or artifacts. Observing both views, the top and side views appear to be disconnected, as if placed separately without concern for integration between perspectives. Normally, transitions between different views in a coherent depiction would involve overlapping elements or continuation of lines to unify the image. However, in this image, no such integration is visible, suggesting distinct separateness without any noticeable artifacts or breaks in the direct sense since they are independent images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all views of the car maintain consistent material properties and lighting, avoiding unnatural differences?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's side view is realistically rendered, with reflections on the windows and body indicating a glossy finish under natural lighting. In contrast, the top view lacks shading or highlights, appearing as a basic line drawing. The lighting and material properties differ significantly between the two. The side view exhibits material characteristics typical of a real car, whereas the top view appears simplified and abstract, not maintaining consistency in terms of material properties and lighting.",

      "question": "Does the car's geometry appear proportionally correct and undistorted across all views, particularly in the wheels and body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the side and top views in Image B, the side view of the car shows a realistic proportion with correctly designed elements like wheels and body panels, reflecting the actual car model's design. The top view, being a simplified line diagram without scale details, does not provide proportional information but does not suggest distortion either—it's drawn in a manner typical for basic top-down schematics where dimensions aren't highlighted. There appear to be no distortions in the portrayal of the geometry such as unrealistic shapes or incorrect scaling.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In the top view, are the car's roofline and window outlines clear and detailed, without any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top view in Image B is schematic, presenting clear outlines of the roofline and windows in a simplified form. While not highly detailed as a realistic illustration would be, in its schematic nature, the outlines remain distinct and serve the function of showing basic shape without intricate detail loss. Such views prioritize outline clarity over detailing fine nuances, meaning the essential shapes are conveyed effectively.",

      "question": "Do the newly added views of the car integrate seamlessly with the background, without introducing any disruptive discontinuities or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of the car’s views with a background is not relevant, as the perspective views are juxtaposed without a cohesive background setting. Each view is distinct and appears as a separate entity without a surrounding environment to assess integration. Normally, seamless integration would be judged by the harmony between the object and its environment; here, with absent integration context, no disruptive discontinuities or inconsistencies in relation to a background can be discerned.",
