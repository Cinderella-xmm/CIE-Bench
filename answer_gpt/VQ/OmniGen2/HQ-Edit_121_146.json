      "question": "Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass chamber does indeed show characteristics typical of natural glass, such as transparency and consistent refraction which can be observed in the way light interacts with it. The gold floral motifs appear well-defined and exhibit texture that aligns with real, embossed designs, devoid of visible distortions or unnatural appearances typical of digital editing flaws.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The camel red coloration in Image B is evenly distributed throughout the glass chamber, creating a cohesive and harmonious look with the gold and silver elements.

      "question": "Does the wooden lid accurately reflect the contour and curvature of the original teapot handle, and does it display natural wood grain and polish without visible artifacts or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden lid in Image B is depicted with realistic wood grain and polish, reflecting characteristics typical of natural wood. Its contour and curvature complement the adjacent elements without obvious geometric distortions or artifacts, which suggests a well-integtrated addition in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned on the base in a way that aligns with the existing decorative elements, and does it lack jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast that would suggest digital insertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo is placed on the base without apparent misalignment or jagged edges. The contrast of the logo is consistent with the surrounding decorative elements, indicating a seamless integration rather than an overlay.",

      "question": "Does the newly added patterned fabric background exhibit consistent texture, proper lighting interaction, and seamless integration with the teapot's shadow and reflection on the surface below, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterned fabric background in Image B shows consistent texture and engages correctly with the lighting conditions of the image. It smoothly integrates with the teapot's shadows and reflections, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies that would hint at editing issues.",
