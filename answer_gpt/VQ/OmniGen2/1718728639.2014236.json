      "question": "Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armorâ€™s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tesserae on the chest and torso are arranged in a way that reflects the curved design of armor, which is typical of mosaic art. The tiles are consistently sized and aligned to contour with the armor's shape without visible breaks or misalignments. This continuity and craftsmanship are common in well-designed mosaics, ensuring a smooth transition across the surface.",
