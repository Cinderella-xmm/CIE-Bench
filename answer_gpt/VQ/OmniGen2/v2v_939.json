        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D character in Image B is realistically proportioned according to typical chibi art, which often features larger heads and smaller bodies.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall and drainpipe in Image B maintain a realistic appearance, similar to wall textures and drainpipes in real life. The water flow from the pipe interacts with the ground plausibly, with no artifacts affecting its trajectory or pooling behavior.",
