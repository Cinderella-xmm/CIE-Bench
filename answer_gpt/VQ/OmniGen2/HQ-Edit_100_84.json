      "question": "Are the added decorative patterns on the dhowâ€™s hull and deck aligned with the wood grain and structural lines, and do they lack jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dhow is prominently featured. The decorative patterns are intricate and seem to follow the natural curves and lines of the boat, fitting seamlessly with the structure, which suggests proper alignment with the wood grain and hull lines. There are no visible jagged edges or unnatural textures, which indicates high-quality design integration. Since these are common evaluative criteria for reviewing the integration of decorative patterns on surfaces, the alignments appear well executed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mythical sea creatures near the dhow have smooth contours, realistic scales or skin textures, and proper interaction with the water surface (e.g., ripples, reflections)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mythical sea creatures, which appear to be fish, are stylized rather than realistic, as part of a graphic art style depiction. Their contours are smooth and designed with a clear, clean outline suitable for illustrative purposes, rather than textured or realistic. Their interaction with the water does not include natural ripples or reflections, being part of an illustrative illustration where stylistic choices (like omitting realistic water interaction) are intentional.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the blue and gold tones applied consistently across the scene without causing color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of detail in shaded areas of the boat and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which utilizes a graphic design approach, the blue and gold tones are applied uniformly across the scene with clear distinctions between various elements, such as the sky, water, and the dhow, avoiding color bleeding. This style allows for sharp lines and clear separation of colors, with no signs of pixelation or significant loss of detail in shaded areas, maintaining the integrity of the elements depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant sailboats rendered as dark, simplified shapes that maintain their boat-like outline and do not merge into the sky or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smaller boats in the background are simplified, consistent with the flat, illustrative style of the scene. They are portrayed in dark, silhouette-like shapes that are distinct from the sky and water, preserving their boat-like outline without merging or blending into the surroundings. This is typical of such graphic depictions, where distant elements are often simplified to reduce detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Arabian skyline mirage at the horizon rendered with a soft, shimmering effect that blends with the sky and water, and does it display geometric patterns without sharp edges or solid blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features an Arabian skyline represented in a silhouette against a colored sky. The skyline is depicted with a soft effect to create distance, although not necessarily with a 'shimmering' effect typical of a mirage but more of the outlined simplistic style. The geometric shapes of domes and towers are visible without sharp edges, fitting seamlessly into the stylized theme of the artwork.",
