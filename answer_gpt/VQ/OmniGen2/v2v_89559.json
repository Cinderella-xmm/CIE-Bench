      "question": "Do the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos appear as coherent golden statuettes without any unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logos 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' seem to be rendered in a similar style as in Image A, geographically cohesive and without obvious broken parts or irregular textures. They maintain a structured and coherent appearance with defined borders, which indicates that there hasn't been a transformation to golden statuettes without unnatural textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dark velvet curtain background complement the golden statuettes without introducing any unnatural lighting effects or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a dark velvet curtain backdrop, which harmonizes with the prominent colored logos but doesn't present any visible golden statuettes as stated. Therefore, it complements the logos visually, but since there are no golden statuettes present, the claim about complementing golden statuettes is not applicable.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the 'Sumo Digital' logo appear as a naturally embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque without any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Sumo Digital' logo in Image B is placed as part of the 'Rising Star' logo, similar to its presentation in Image A. It does not appear on a polished wooden plaque but rather integrated into a graphic logo. There are no specific indications of it being embossed in the current presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the 'Character Art Directory 2018' text presented in a visually plausible engraved silver style without any distortion or loss of legibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text appears to be 'SUMO 2018 Charactery 2018' placed on a wooden plaque, not in silver or engraved style. The visibility suggests no distortion or legibility issue, but it does not fulfill the condition of a 'visually plausible engraved silver style'.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the edited image maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without any obvious artifacts or unnatural transitions between elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features several well-incorporated elements with smooth transitions and a coherent layout which preserves the overall composition and maintains structural consistency. The logos, text, and curtain background are arranged without visible artifacts or unnatural transitions. Thus, it holds visual credibility.",
