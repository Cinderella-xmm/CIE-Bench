      "question": "Does the pastel purple fur with teal accents maintain natural fur texture and gradient transitions across the body, particularly on the tail and back, without visible color blocking or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is depicted with pastel purple fur and teal accents. The style of the image is cartoonish, typical of children's illustrations where textures are often smoothed for visual simplicity rather than detailed to mimic natural fur. The gradient transitions are smooth to visually indicate the squirrel's body contours, but the colors are blocky, which is characteristic of cartoons and not akin to natural fur textures. This simplification aligns with the cartoon design, focusing more on visual appeal than realistic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the backpack positioned correctly on the squirrel’s back without deforming its posture or causing unnatural bulges in the fur, and does it display consistent material texture and shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack on the cartoon squirrel in Image B appears appropriately positioned, joining at the shoulders and resting naturally on the back without evident distortion to the squirrel's posture. The cartoon style permits exaggerated shapes, which is why the fur does not show bulges but conforms around the backpack naturally. The texture and shading of the backpack are consistent with the cartoon style, complementing the lighting within the scene, thus appearing coherent with its surroundings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned symmetrically over the squirrel’s eyes with proper reflection details and soft shadows, and do they not distort the eye area or appear disproportionately large?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glasses on the squirrel in Image B are placed symmetrically across the nose and aligned properly with the eyes, which are wide-open in a cartoon style. The glasses do not create distortion in the eye region, maintaining the overall proportion relative to the face while complimenting the visual aesthetic of the character. Reflection details and shadows are consistent with the cartoon appearance, which may not emphasize realism but provides a coherent style fit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the integration of the squirrel into the new forest background seamless, with no visible edge artifacts, mismatched lighting, or floating elements around the feet and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows the cartoon squirrel integrated into a forest setting without noticeable edge artifacts that might otherwise appear when objects are improperly blended or when lighting mismatches occur. The cartoon setting permits simplified visual elements which help in maintaining coherence, and the lighting appears consistent across the squirrel and the background, enhancing seamless integration without floating or mismatched components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cartoonish flowers and mushrooms positioned at plausible distances from the squirrel, showing correct occlusion and depth cues, and do they have consistent textures and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cartoon mushrooms and flowers are arranged around the squirrel with plausible distances, suggesting a suitable depth of field typical of a forest scene. Occlusion effects, where elements partially overlap due to perspective, are correctly utilized, ensuring the cartoonish nature doesn't disrupt spatial coherence. Textures and shading of these elements match the scene's overall style, contributing to the integrated narrative without visual inconsistency.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the title banner positioned above the squirrel at a reasonable height, with legible text and soft shadows that match the scene’s lighting, without overlapping key elements like the squirrel’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is positioned above the squirrel such that it doesn't interfere with the visual space occupied by key elements like the squirrel's head. The text on the banner is in bold, colorful font ensuring legibility, and the positioning reflects reasonableness within the composition of the image. Shadows projected by the banner adhere to the cartoon lighting, maintaining coherent integration without overshadowing primary details.",
