    "Question": "Q1: Does the statue's body maintain anatomically accurate proportions and joint alignment, with no bent or elongated limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue appears to have natural body proportions and joint alignments. The stance is elegant and typical of classic statues, which aim for anatomical accuracy. There are no visible distortions, bent or elongated limbs, which suggests that the artist intended to keep the natural human body form. World knowledge of classical sculptures usually reflects an idealized human form, which is consistent with the visual cues in Image B.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gold motifs and patterns on the saree clearly visible as engraved details on the marble surface, with no loss of fine lines or texture degradation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the saree's motifs and patterns made of gold appear to be subtly integrated into the marble surface, but due to the nature of marble, the visibility of engraved details is not as prominent; hence, fine lines or intricate textures might not be expected to appear clearly on a marble statue. World knowledge of marble carving would suggest limitations in maintaining the vivid clarity of such details. Generally, gold finishes would involve paint or thin layers rather than deep engraving on marble.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the statueâ€™s standing pose balanced and physically rational, with feet properly grounded and weight distributed naturally?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the statue assuming a pose reminiscent of classical contrapposto, where one foot is forward, and the weight is shifted to one leg, giving a dynamic yet balanced form. The feet appear to be properly grounded on the pedestal, providing a stable base for the stature, adhering to the principles of weight distribution in sculptures, reflecting the portrayal of physical rationality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the jewelry elements (necklace, earrings, bangles) seamlessly integrated into the marble surface as engraved or raised details, with no gaps or floating appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jewelry appears to be rendered as though they are part of the statue which suggests a seamless integration into the marble. The depiction avoids any obvious gaps or floating effects, which points toward efforts to incorporate these accessories into the sculpture design in a coherent manner. Traditional statues that incorporate such elements tend to emphasize unity in material continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
