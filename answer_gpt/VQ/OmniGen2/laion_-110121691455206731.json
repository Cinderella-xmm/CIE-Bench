      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are added to the dial in place of the subdials for a stylized effect. However, their placement overlaps with the areas designated for numerals and subdials, creating a playful but clear visual distinction. The facial features do not seamlessly blend with the metallic texture, as they are cartoonish and stand out against the brushed metal surface, introducing some discrepancy in shading and edges. Therefore, the answer is based on the observation that while they are playful additions, they do not blend with the existing texture and positioning naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the detective desk and magnifying glass proportionally sized relative to the watch, and are they rendered with consistent line weight and shading that matches the comic style without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the detective desk and magnifying glass are incorporated into a comic-style scene. The proportions and line weights are consistently maintained in alignment with the style of drawing, and the spatial relationship between these items and the watch is well managed. The magnifying glass and desk are rendered without geometric distortion, as seen within a typical comic layout where stylized exaggeration does not affect the logical spatial coherence. Thus, the proportions and rendering style support a consistent comic aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements (cluttered office items) appear spatially coherent with the watch, showing correct layering and perspective without overlapping or clipping through the watch's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements like the cluttered office items are depicted in a way that complements the comic narrative. They are arranged in a manner that respects spatial coherence, lining well with the watch's position in the foreground. The elements do not overlap or clip into the watch, indicating a well-maintained layering and perspective consistent with the illustration’s style.",

      "question": "Are the tick mark sound effects uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered around the dial, without jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tick mark sound effects in Image B are added as a stylistic choice to enhance the comic touch. They are placed around the dial with uniform spacing and consistent shapes, keeping the rendering clean and coherent with the rest of the illustration's aesthetic. There are no signs of jagged edges, smudging or any inconsistent spacing, indicating the visual choices were deliberate and fitting the overall design theme.",

      "question": "Does the stylized version retain the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case, with no visible texture warping or color inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized comic version of the watch attempts to retain some of the original texture characteristics, like the black leather strap and brushed silver finish. While the texture and color details are simplified to fit the comic style, the leather strap’s dark color and general appearance remain consistent, as does the silver tone of the watch case. Despite some stylistic simplification, the integrity of the textures and colors is preserved without evident warping or inconsistency.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window preserved in their original positions and proportions, without being obscured or deformed by the added facial features or other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original layout of hour and minute hands and other components has been altered in Image B to fit the comic strip's narrative. The subdials and date window are transformed into faces and comic elements, with their positions and proportions adjusted to match the stylized depiction. Thus, these components are not preserved in their original form and are instead creatively transformed, leading to their partial obscuring and deformation.",
