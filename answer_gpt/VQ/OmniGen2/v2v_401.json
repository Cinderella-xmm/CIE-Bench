      "question": "Do the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes retain their natural texture and appearance after being incorporated into the treasure map design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the croissants, macarons, and cupcakes maintain a realistic and natural appearance. The visual texture of each dessert reflects what one would expect from a freshly baked good, with smooth and non-distorted frosting, crisp edges on the croissants, and distinct, round macarons. These features indicate that the natural appearance of these desserts has been retained, suggesting no significant alteration has taken place during their incorporation into the treasure map design.",

      "question": "Is the dotted trail leading to the frosting-shaped 'X' integrated smoothly without causing any unnatural textures or loss of detail on the surrounding desserts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dotted trail in Image B is a visual representation of a path on the map that moves across the desserts, leading to an X made of frosting. The details of the desserts, such as the frosting on the cupcakes and the texture of the macarons, remain clear and undisturbed. This indicates that the trail does not interfere with or obscure the fine details of the desserts, suggesting a smooth integration.",

      "question": "Do the sugar-coated compass rose and berries appear naturally placed and enhance the dessert-themed journey without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass rose and berries are positioned on the map alongside other dessert items. The design of the compass rose reflects a traditional map aesthetic but, combined with the dessert theme, it fits the whimsical and thematic approach. The berries are also strategically placed, enhancing the visual appeal without distracting from the map theme. This indicates that they appear naturally placed and cohesive within the design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the desserts, such as the size of the croissants, cupcakes, and macarons, appear in harmony with one another, maintaining a size and shape that one might typically expect. There is no visual evidence of distortion or unnatural scaling in comparison to the expected real-world appearance of these items. This consistency maintains realism within the context of the treasure map.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is designed to resemble weathered parchment, a common trope for treasure maps. The desserts sit atop this background without losing their textural details or experiencing any blending issues, such as color bleeding or unnatural shadow artifacts. The desserts and the map background coexist without visual conflict, indicating seamless integration.",
