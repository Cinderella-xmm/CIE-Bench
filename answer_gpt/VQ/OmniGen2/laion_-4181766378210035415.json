    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, only the duvet portion appears to be transformed into LEGO bricks while the bed frame, mattress, and base remain unchanged. The LEGO bricks forming what looks like the duvet are properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments, reflecting a standard LEGO connection.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows a duvet with a subtle floral pattern design. In Image B, this duvet has been replaced by blue LEGO bricks, removing all floral patterns. Since the design of the duvet was changed to blue LEGO bricks, the question about consistency with a floral pattern is not applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headboard is not modified with LEGO-style elements; it remains the same as in Image A. It retains its original design without being altered to fit LEGO elements, so the question about realistic LEGO curvature is not applicable here.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the pillows remain unchanged and are not made from LEGO bricks. They are regular pillows with no evidence of LEGO construction or alteration, so the three-dimensionality and layering are consistent with regular pillows, not LEGO.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting direction and softness of the shadows in Image B are consistent with the lighting in Image A. The shadows are soft and follow the same direction as seen in the original image, without any unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas, even with the changed duvet to LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet (now LEGO), and headboard remain consistent. There are no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements despite the duvet changing into LEGO bricks in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B have a uniform matte finish, typical of standard LEGO pieces. There is no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation, indicating a high-quality rendering consistent with LEGO's aesthetic.",
