      "question": "Are the clothing and bags of both women depicted with soft gradient blocks that retain their original shapes and proportions without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and bags of both women appear to have been rendered using a style that emphasizes bold colors and simplified textures without gradient transitions. The shapes and proportions are well-maintained, indicating a clean and intentional design choice aimed at creating a stylized look while preserving the essential form of the objects. Therefore, the representation is clear and cohesive, and any deviation from realism is an artistic decision that does not introduce unnatural artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mannequins and their outfits inside the store window appear structurally coherent and visually plausible in terms of shape and material after the style conversion, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the mannequins and their outfits are depicted using bold and flat colors, which simplifies the texture compared to realistic representations. Despite this artistic style, the structural coherence and shapes remain clear, preserving the visual plausibility of the mannequins without introducing distortions or unrealistic textures. The transformation aligns with a consistent visual theme that seeks a more graphic approach, which maintains overall clarity and intentional design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the storefront maintain its original architectural details, such as the frame and tiles, without any visible distortion or introduction of non-natural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the storefront has been adapted into a more graphic and formatted representation, which includes the large text 'VOGUE' in the background. While this design transformation shifts the visual focus, the structural elements such as the frame remain intact and clear. The absence of textured gradients or complex real-world details is part of the stylized edit, tuning into bold uniform colors; yet, this does not imply distortion, rather an artistic choice for simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the cobblestone pavement represented naturally with soft gradients, maintaining the structural integrity and visual coherence without any loss of detail or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone pavement has been transformed to a solid color without individual stone textures or gradients seen in reality. The decision focuses on a more stylized and minimalist appearance, diverging from natural textures. Although there isn't a loss of form, the texture is not naturally represented, providing a graphic rather than a nuanced, textural rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects and shadows in the image convincingly portrayed with soft gradient blocks, ensuring they contribute to the overall realism and natural appearance without breaking the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows have been stylized to match the graphic revision of the image, foregoing realistic gradient transitions. The light is evenly distributed over flat colors without gradients, which diminishes the realistic aspects of lighting and shadow. While it contributes to coherence within the context of this stylized design, it does not fulfill a realistic or naturally nuanced portrayal.",
