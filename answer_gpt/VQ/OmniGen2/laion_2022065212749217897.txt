    "Question": "Q1: Is the head disproportionately large compared to the body but without stretched or compressed facial features?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the head of the figure is represented in a chibi-like style, where it is common for the head to be disproportionately large compared to the body. This stylistic choice does not lead to any stretching or compressing of features, as chibi art typically maintains the facial features intact albeit simplified. Thus, the head is larger, aligning with the chibi style where no normal facial distortion occurs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly visible and proportionally accurate despite the enlarged head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's face is intentionally blurred and not visible. As a result, it's not possible to evaluate the proportional accuracy or clarity of the facial features based on the given image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the stripes on the shirt maintain consistent width, alignment, and color accuracy across the collar and chest area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the shirt appear to be consistently wide and aligned correctly across the collar and chest area. The colors are bright and consistent, as is commonly found in cartoon depictions. Therefore, they maintain a consistent appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the surface of the figure appear smooth and reflective, with no visible texture artifacts or rough edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's surface looks smooth and the outlines are clean, which is typical for cartoon characters. The finish appears polished, with no visible texture artifacts or rough edges, consistent with digital art styles meant to appear glossy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a uniform pastel color with no gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts near the figure's edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of two distinct pastel colors, yellow and pink, split diagonally. There are no visible gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts near the figure's edges. This division maintains a clear and clean appearance, typical for stylized artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the facial expression more animated than the original (e.g., wider eyes, open mouth) but still anatomically consistent and not distorted?",
    "explanation": "The facial expression in Image B cannot be analyzed because the face is blurred. Therefore, it's not possible to determine if facial features are more animated or distorted compared to the original image.",
    "answer": "No"
