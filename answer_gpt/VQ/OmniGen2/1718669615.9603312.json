    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the spaceship retain a coherent circular shape with consistent proportions, and are the added circular motifs and meander patterns aligned symmetrically without warping or overlapping irregularly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the object transformed into a vase maintains a coherent circular shape similar to a spaceship's, which is typically symmetrical due to its structure. The circular motifs and meander patterns follow the cylindrical vase shape and appear well-aligned and symmetrical, further highlighted by the symmetry of shapes and patterns characteristic of modern rendering techniques.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the painted patterns on the spaceshipâ€™s surface free from digital artifacts, such as jagged edges, unnatural brushstroke textures, or inconsistent color gradients that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features well-defined painted patterns on its surface with smooth gradients and precise line work. These patterns appear intentionally designed rather than poorly rendered, showcasing uniform colors and transitions that are consistent with high-quality digital art standards.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the abstract wave forms in the landscape below continuous and smoothly curved, avoiding sharp breaks or abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays abstract wave-like formations that are smoothly curved, creating continuous lines and transitions without noticeable disruptions. These formations appear as natural elements of the scene and are consistent with a flowing design aesthetic that eliminates sharp breaks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the colors in the transformed landscape consist exclusively of muted earth tones (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) without any bright or out-of-place colors like neon greens or electric blues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in the edited image is dominated by earth tones such as browns and tans, with a harmonious blend of subdued colors that align with natural landscapes typically comprising subtle hues. There are no bright or contrasting colors such as neon greens or electric blues that would create inconsistency with the earth tone palette.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the edited spaceship positioned at a consistent altitude above the abstract landscape, with proper perspective alignment relative to the curved railway tracks below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the seemingly transformed object into a vase is positioned in the center of the abstract landscape. Its placement visually suggests proportional altitude relative to the waves, maintaining a sense of perspective and alignment consistent with a centered and balanced artistic design.",
