      "question": "Does the heart balloon retain its geometric shape without any broken lines or unnatural textures in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart balloon retains a clear geometric shape. The mosaic tiles are arranged in a way that outlines the heart shape without any visible breaks or unnatural textures, maintaining a smooth appearance. Comparatively, in Image A, the heart appears as a solid painting, and in the mosaic style, blocks effectively emulate this clear structure.",

      "question": "Are the child's facial features and hair preserved with clear outlines and no distortion in the mosaic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, facial features and hair seem to follow the general contour seen commonly in artworks aimed at preserving basic outlines. Despite the mosaic style, there's no apparent distortion in these elements, suggesting that the transformation maintains clear outlines, which can be seen in the uniform application of the tiles, arranged carefully to depict these features.",

      "question": "Is the background transformed into a mosaic style without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the blue and yellow color harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background mosaic tiles are arranged consistently without introducing observable artifacts. The transformation maintains the blue and yellow color harmony effectively, matching the vibrancy and distribution of colors seen in the original painted background in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the red balloon maintain its vibrant color and round shape without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red balloon is transformed to a mosaic tile format but retains its vibrant red color and rounded shape. There doesn't appear to be a loss of detail or introduction of textures inconsistent with the balloonâ€™s natural surface, which in Image A is depicted as smooth and reflective.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's hand is clearly represented in the mosaic with a natural shape. The fingers are adequately outlined with no distortion, and the mosaic arrangement does not suggest more than five fingers, showing a careful transition from the original illustration in Image A.",
