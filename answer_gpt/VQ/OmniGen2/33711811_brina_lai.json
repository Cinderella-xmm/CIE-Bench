    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the jagged wing structures formed from the mountain peaks have smooth transitions between rock and ice, and do they follow the natural slope and ridge lines without abrupt geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks maintain natural-looking transitions between rock and ice. The jagged formations are consistent with typical mountain ridge lines, and there are no abrupt geometric distortions that would indicate an unnatural edit. This analysis is based solely on the visual cues present in Image B and common understanding of how natural mountain formations appear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale-like patterns on the lake surface uniformly spaced and reflective, with no visible repetition, pixelation, or mismatched light reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake surface appears to have scale-like patterns that seem uniformly spaced and reflective. The patterns do not show signs of repetition, pixelation, or inconsistencies in light reflection, which are typical indicators of digital manipulation. This observation is based solely on visual analysis of Image B and understanding of natural water surface patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the peninsula resemble a continuous, tapering tail with natural curvature and surface texture, and are there no sudden breaks or unnatural bulges in its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The peninsula in Image B presents a tapered form with natural curvature and a realistic surface texture, consistent with a landform extending into water. There are no visible sudden breaks or unnatural bulges. This judgement leverages understanding of geographic and topographic features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the house structures reshaped into a linear metallic spine that lies flat on the ground with consistent material shading and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible transformation of house structures into a linear metallic spine. The houses maintain their original architectural form and placement on the landscape, with no indication of being reshaped into spine-like structures. This analysis adheres to visual perception and the description suggests consistent material shading without breakage, indicating a lack of such transformation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the cloud eyes have clear, symmetrical pupil and iris structures, and are they seamlessly integrated into the existing cloud layer without visible borders or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict cloud formations with eye-like structures. The clouds appear as typical cloud formations without any unusual pupil or iris-like features. This conclusion is based on analysis of the clouds in the image for any unnatural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the grass fur consistently aligned in a single direction across the field, with natural-looking flow and no clumped or artificially drawn streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B, resembling grass or fur, maintains a natural appearance with a realistic flow and alignment across the field. There is no visible clustering or drawing artifacts in the texture, indicating it is naturally depicted and consistent with real-life observation of grassy fields.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, duplicated textures, or lighting mismatches between the transformed elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, fur) and the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, there are no apparent seams, duplicated textures, or lighting mismatches between the elements present and the surrounding landscape. The landscape's elements appear naturally integrated without discrepancies indicative of digital editing inconsistencies, reflecting the harmony typically found in natural settings.",
