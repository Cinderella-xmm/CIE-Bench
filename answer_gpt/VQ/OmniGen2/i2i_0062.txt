    "Question": "Q2: Are the gray T-shirt and shorts of the chibi character accurately and naturally represented, without introducing any unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the cartoonified skateboard retain its visual plausibility with no unnatural textures or loss of fine details that would disrupt the scene’s authenticity?",
    "explanation": "With Image B being entirely white, there are no visual elements, including a skateboard, to evaluate for visual plausibility or detail preservation.

    "Question": "Q5: Does the edited image exhibit overall authenticity and natural appearance, with no obvious artifacts or distortions introduced during the stylization process?",
