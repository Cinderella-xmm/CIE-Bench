    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brass gears and copper funnels are meticulously crafted to appear authentic, with shiny and detailed surfaces indicative of real metal. The light interacts naturally with these elements, enhancing their metallic luster without signs of pixelation or artificiality. This impression relies on the understanding that metals like brass and copper exhibit specific reflective qualities, and the image creators have successfully captured this realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces appear well-integrated with the dome. The numerals and hands on the clock faces maintain their shape and alignment, adhering to the expected curves and forms associated with a spherical surface. The clock faces show no signs of deformation or misalignment, suggesting a precise application of perspective and proportion techniques.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
    "explanation": "The steam in Image B appears naturally luminous and translucent, a trait achieved by capturing how real steam diffuses light. It emerges smoothly from vents, forming a realistic cloud-like shape without sharp edges or unnatural looking clusters. This depiction requires an understanding of how steam looks and behaves under various lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the ornamental metalwork around the dome appears seamless and proportional, with smooth lines and consistent detail work. There are no visible gaps or irregularities in the decorative elements, pointing to an attentive rendering process without errors such as jagged edges or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water reflects the building and all steampunk elements symmetrically. The reflection retains clarity and consistency with the structure's orientation and position. There are no distortions or asymmetries in the reflection, ensuring it accurately mirrors the scene's visual elements, including gears, clock faces, and steam.",
    "answer": "Yes"
