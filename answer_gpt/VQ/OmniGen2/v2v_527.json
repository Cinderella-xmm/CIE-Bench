      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation of the dog sitting atop the stop sign appears consistent with the typical design standards of LEGO figurines. It has clearly defined shapes and proportions, common in LEGO models, and retains a visual credibility akin to realistic canine anatomy as interpreted in LEGO style. The integrity of the object is consistent without any apparent distortions or artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the gradient shading used for the sky and clouds preserve their natural appearance and depth without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gradient shading for the sky and clouds displays a smooth transition between colors, consistent with a clear sky. The gentle shifts in hue from darker to lighter blue and soft cloud outlines are natural, maintaining depth and three-dimensional appearance. There are no visible unnatural textures or digital artifacts disrupting this natural progression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO-style stop sign in Image B maintains proper proportions and precise geometric shapes typical of LEGO construction. The octagonal shape is symmetrical and retains the physical rationality necessary for LEGO models, without any visible distortion to the stop sign itself.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the base and nameplate free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base and nameplate have a smooth finish with clean edges, which are consistent with high-quality display bases. The nameplate, labeled 'Golden Companion', is visually credible with no signs of unnatural textures or artifacts affecting its appearance.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosure preserve its authenticity and natural appearance, without introducing any visual distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent glass cube enclosure in Image B appears visually consistent with realistic glass enclosures, providing a clear view of the contents without introducing distortions or artifacts. The transparency is uniform, and the enclosure retains its authenticity in the context of a display setting.",
