      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard seamlessly blend with the surrounding environment, avoiding any unnatural glow or oversaturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keyboard emits a blue-purple neon glow that contrasts against the surrounding dark environment. The neon effect appears vibrant, but it blends well with the low light setting, providing a realistic lighting scenario typically observed in ambient settings with artificial lighting. This avoids any signs of oversaturation or an unnatural glow.",

      "question": "Are the glowing fingertips free of unnatural textures, keeping the hands' structure realistic and preserving the natural texture and curvature of the fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingertips are illuminated with a neon light, yet they maintain a realistic appearance. The neon lights do not distort the natural texture, curvature, or anatomical structure of the fingers, which are smoothly contoured and remain lifelike despite the illuminating effect.",

      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original shape and functionality, with no visible distortion or breaking of keys despite the addition of neon lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the keyboard keeps its original layout and structure with all the keys intact. The presence of neon lighting doesn't alter or distort the physical aspects of the keyboard, which suggests that the shape and functionality are preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the details on the laptopâ€™s surface and key caps preserved their sharpness, with no blurring or pixelation caused by the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the details on the laptop's surface and the individual key caps being distinct and sharp. The neon lighting enhances the aesthetic without causing loss of detail through blurring or pixelation. The overall image maintains clarity despite the vibrant illumination.",

      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard interact correctly with the rest of the scene's lighting, creating believable reflections or shadows where appropriate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue-purple neon lights create reflections on the fingertips, which demonstrate a realistic interaction with the scene. The lighting effects are consistent with how neon lights typically cast reflections, and there are believable shadows and reflections enhancing the scene's realism.",
