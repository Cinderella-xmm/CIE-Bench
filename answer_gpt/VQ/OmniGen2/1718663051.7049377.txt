    "Question": "Q1: Are the branches of the tree composed of clean, angular geometric lines consistent with Art Deco style, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a tree where the branches are depicted with a stylized, streamlined design typical of Art Deco style, emphasizing clean and concise lines. There are no jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure, suggesting an intentional design motif. Art Deco often embodies such geometric patterns, reinforcing the visual appearance seen in this image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the grass in the foreground display muted, uniform coloration with preserved textural details such as individual blades or soft gradients, rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially colored?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the grass in the foreground is represented with consistent coloration and appears smoothly integrated into the stained glass motif, lacking individual textural details like blades or gradients. The palette and style favor uniform flat colors typical of the stained glass effect, as opposed to realistic texturing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the mountain silhouettes composed of defined angular planes in bronze and teal tones, maintaining layered depth and spatial consistency without overlapping or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows mountain silhouettes rendered in defined geometric planes with a consistent Art Deco palette dominated by teal tones. These planes are designed to maintain spatial consistency with a distinct layered effect, avoiding any visual issues such as overlapping or floating sections, fitting the structured stylization of stained glass.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the sky feature a smooth gradient from dark at the top to lighter near the horizon, with thin, evenly spaced accent lines that follow the curvature of the scene without intersecting or distorting the starfield?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sky consists of uniform color blocks typical of stained glass art, rather than a smooth gradient. Furthermore, there are no accent lines; instead, the segmentation is evident through clearly delineated panes typically found in stained glass art rather than a gradient or starfield.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all elements—tree, mountains, and sky—rendered with consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills, lacking transparent patches, misaligned edges, or inconsistent shading within the same layer?",
    "explanation": "Image B effectively utilizes consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills across all elements, including the tree, mountains, and sky. This is characteristic of stained glass art, where each section is bounded and filled uniformly, avoiding issues like transparent patches or misaligned edges. Shading remains consistent within each distinct layer or section, reinforcing the coherent design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
