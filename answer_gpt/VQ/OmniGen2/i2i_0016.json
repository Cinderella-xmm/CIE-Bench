      "question": "Are the clothing and hairstyle features of the players accurately represented in chibi form without artificial or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are depicted in a chibi style, which is a stylized and simplified cartoon form. This style naturally exaggerates certain features while minimizing others to create a cute representation. The hairstyle is simplified but retains enough detail to make it identifiable, and the clothing, while less detailed, is still recognizable and clear without any artificial textures. Commonly in chibi art, textures are either minimalist or indicated through basic patterns. Compared to the original detailed depiction in Image A, this is an accurate representation given the artistic style.",

      "question": "Do the players' hands in the handshake pose appear natural and anatomically correct, with no missing or extra fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi characters in Image B are depicted with hands that are greatly simplified to match the art style. Despite the simplified form, the hands perform a recognizable handshake, which is a common depiction in cartoon and chibi styles. There are neither missing nor extra fingers, adhering to what is expected in cartoon representations. The anatomical correctness in terms of the number of fingers aligns with common representations of hands in chibi art.",

      "question": "Does the semi-transparent tennis court logo integrate smoothly into the background without creating distracting artifacts or distorting the tennis court?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo is integrated into the background in a manner typical for chibi or cartoon depictions, providing an aesthetic that does not interfere with the main subjects. The simple background ensures that there are no distracting visual artifacts and the logo, even if semi-transparent, does not distort or alter the perception of the main subjects or the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tennis rackets proportionally appropriate for the chibi characters and clearly identifiable as tennis rackets without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis rackets in Image B, while simplified, maintain their identity through distinctive features such as the circular head and handle, which are common identification markers for tennis rackets. In chibi style, proportions are typically exaggerated to enhance cuteness, so the rackets are appropriately sized for the characters. This proportion aligns with the style's norms, and there are no distortions that detract from their recognition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details like facial expressions and clothing patterns on the chibi characters been preserved without significant loss or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts characters in a chibi style that naturally simplifies details to create a cute effect. Facial expressions are typically basic yet expressive in this art form. The clothing is noted for its clear and recognizable design despite the lack of intricate detail, which is consistent with this style. There is no evidence of unnatural smoothing; rather, the simplicity is an intentional artistic choice rather than a loss of detail.",
