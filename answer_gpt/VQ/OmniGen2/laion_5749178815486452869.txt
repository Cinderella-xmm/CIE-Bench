    "Question": "Q1: Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green field indeed appears to be an island floating in space. It has clean, continuous edges which stand out against the starry background. There are no visible distortions or broken geometry that suggest irregularity, indicating that the floating field is well-integrated within the surreal scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers visible on the floating island are brightly colored and appear vibrant. However, upon examining the edges and surface details of the petals, there are no visible unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing, suggesting that they are well rendered within the surreal artwork style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the apple-shaped object depicted is indeed significantly larger than the geometric form that could be compared to a tree. It is properly lit with evident shading and a three-dimensional texture, making it resemble a real fruit much more than a flat graphic element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
    "explanation": "There are no insect figures like a bee or butterfly present in Image B to analyze. The question does not apply since they are not part of the edited image. Presence of such figures would fall out of the context of this specific visual.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is replaced by an angular geometric structure that has a hollow form with clean lines and internal voids. This matches well with the surreal style presented and does not appear fragmented or physically impossible, making it a coherent part of the artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
