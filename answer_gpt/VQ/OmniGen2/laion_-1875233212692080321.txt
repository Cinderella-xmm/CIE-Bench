    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass bottle positioned such that its base aligns with the original location of the rose petals and does not appear disproportionately large or small compared to surrounding elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bottle's base appears well-positioned within the frame, maintaining appropriate proportions with the surrounding elements. The cap and bottle maintain a coherent size, suggesting that the base alignment does not distort the overall composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the petal etchings on the bottle surface continuous and evenly spaced, without visible gaps, pixelation, or irregular line breaks?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any visible petal etchings on the bottle surface. The smooth, clear surface indicates an absence of such details, suggesting that there are no petal etchings to analyze in terms of continuity or spacing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the gold rose-shaped cap exhibit realistic reflections and specular highlights that match the light source direction and do not appear overly shiny or uniformly colored?",
    "explanation": "The gold rose-shaped cap in Image B shows realistic reflections and highlights that correspond with the assumed light source, presenting natural variations in color and shine, which enhance its three-dimensional and realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the deep crimson gradient inside the bottle smoothly blended across the vertical axis, without visible color bands or uneven transitions?",
    "explanation": "The gradient within the bottle in Image B appears smoothly blended, with a harmonious transition in color across the vertical axis. There are no visible color bands or abrupt transitions that would detract from the smoothness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the vertical gold logo clearly legible, evenly spaced, and aligned along the side of the bottle without warping, fading, or overlapping with other elements?",
    "explanation": "The gold logo on the bottle in Image B is clear and legible, demonstrating even spacing and proper alignment. There are no signs of warping, fading, or overlap with other design elements, ensuring its clarity and readability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
