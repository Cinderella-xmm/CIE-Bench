    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the bark textures on the logs continuous and aligned with the original log shapes, showing no abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bark textures are applied to the logs in a consistent and continuous manner. The textures follow the curvature of the logs, and there are no evident abrupt edges or scaling inconsistencies. This suggests that the textures are appropriately aligned with the log's shapes, creating a natural appearance. It reflects a realistic depiction of log textures with proper integration into the overall design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing amber eyes fit precisely within the original window openings without distorting the surrounding log structure or spreading light beyond the intended area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts windows as glowing amber eyes that fit neatly into circular openings, maintaining the integrity of the log structure. The surrounding logs are undistorted, and the light emanating from the eyes remains contained within the frame of the windows, adding to the mystical aspect without affecting adjacent structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the leafy canopy extend upward from the roof ridge in a natural, gravity-consistent manner, with leaves overlapping logically and not appearing suspended or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leafy canopy in Image B is designed to naturally extend upward from the roof ridge, demonstrating logical overlapping of leaves that adhere to gravity. The pattern and placement of the leaves look natural and coherent, without any elements appearing detached or suspended unnaturally. This follows realistic growth patterns one would expect in such a setting.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vines and moss growing along the logs and roofline in a way that follows natural climbing patterns, with no flat, disconnected patches or unnatural straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features vines and moss that largely follow natural climbing patterns. They appear to weave organically along the logs and roofline, without evident flatness or disconnected patches. The growth pattern avoids unnatural straight lines, contributing to a realistic portrayal of vegetation interacting with the log cabin structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the runes carved into the logs with consistent depth and alignment, following the roundness of the logs and not appearing as flat or misaligned symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runes in Image B are carved into the logs with an appropriate level of depth and alignment. They visibly adapt to the curvature of the logs, avoiding flat appearances and maintaining consistent integration with the log roundness. This suggests awareness of log shapes during rune placement and crafting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the forest spirit faces positioned within the original garage door frames, with facial features properly scaled and energy trails flowing outward in a smooth, non-jagged manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays forest spirit faces positioned outside the main structure but within the context of animation effects seen in the environment. While garage doors were noted in Image A, faces and energies are now artistically integrated into the natural setting, suggesting flowing energy without jagged or misplaced elements around any frame-like structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all structural components (logs, roof, canopy, vines, faces) connected seamlessly without gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all structural components appear to be seamlessly connected with no visible gaps or floating elements. The geometry of logs, roof, canopy, vines, and other features maintains consistent integration into the environment, avoiding distortion and presenting a cohesive visual appearance.",
