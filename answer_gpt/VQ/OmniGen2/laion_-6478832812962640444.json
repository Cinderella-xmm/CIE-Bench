      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the boot features metallic inlay textures that appear smooth and consistent throughout the shaft and vamp area. There are no visible seams, texture breaks, or gloss mismatches, suggesting a uniform finish. In comparison, Image A shows a boot with stitched embroidery, which typically includes texture variation. The edited image demonstrates seamless metallic texture, maintaining consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heel is depicted with clean geometric edges and is seamlessly aligned with the sole and boot shaft, indicating precision and structural integrity. Upon examining Image A, the heel appears more conventional, with typical rounded edges. Image B showcases improved alignment with detailed geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays sharp, consistent geometric lines along the shaft and toe area, preserving the natural outline of the boot. The design enhances visual appeal without distorting the boot shape. Conversely, Image A has more organic, less defined patterns, which might create a less refined look compared to Image B's transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic inlays in Image B show uniform specular highlights across the surface, with no appearance of bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections, suggesting a high-quality processing and finish. Image A, while traditional, does not employ metallic textures, allowing for a direct comparison in Image B's refined finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a natural foot-shaped profile with proportionate elements including the toe box, ankle, and shaft height. There is no evidence of elongation, compression, or asymmetry, maintaining the boot's structural and aesthetic balance. Image A also presents a natural foot-shaped profile, but the metallic finish of Image B does not detract from these proportions.",
