    "Question": "Q1: Do the metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet reflect light consistently with the scene’s illumination and maintain accurate surface contours without warping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist's outfit and helmet have a metallic texture that reflects light. The reflections are consistent with a uniform light source, likely front or above, which maintains the material's authentic look without appearing out of place. The reflections follow the contours of the outfit and helmet, indicating proper texture mapping and rendering. This consistency suggests an adherence to realistic lighting and accurate portrayal of materials in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car smooth, evenly lit, and free from jagged edges or overlapping with real-world details like tires or license plates?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the neon glow lines are deliberately integrated into the scene. They smoothly follow the road's edge and the bike and car's outlines without disrupting physical elements like tires or license plates. Their consistent glow and even intensity indicate careful digital editing, ensuring that they blend seamlessly rather than overpowering the primary subjects, which maintains scene coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet aligned with the helmet’s curvature, showing clear digital content without ghosting, blurring, or distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a visor with digital data displays. The display contours match the helmet's curve, suggesting alignment with the underlying surface. The digital content appears without ghosting or distortion, maintaining clarity. The thoughtful execution of this addition reflects an understanding of digital display technology and how it should appear seamlessly integrated within a dynamic setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the holographic cycling stats near the escort car spatially coherent, appropriately sized relative to the car, and displayed with soft edges and ambient glow without casting incorrect shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display is positioned spatially near the car, maintaining coherence with its surroundings. Its size is relatable to the car's dimensions, giving a sense of tech-based enhancement rather than overshadowing the main subjects. The soft edges and ambient glow exhibit a familiarity with holographic visual effects, crucial for rendering without casting unwarranted shadows. This integration suggests a sophisticated editing approach that respects spatial dynamics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements—including metallic finishes, neon glows, digital visor display, and holographic projections—coexist without visual contradictions such as mismatched lighting, texture clashes, or distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of various digital enhancements is done cohesively. The metallic textures, neon glows, visor displays, and holographics all share synchronized lighting and stylistic continuity. There are no visible mismatches in lighting or unexplained texture clashes that would detract from the immersive quality of the image. Each element maintains its intended effect while contributing to the overall futuristic and sleek look of the scene, avoiding visual contradictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
