      "question": "Is the outline of the purple blouse magnet smooth and symmetrical, with recognizable embroidered patterns intact and not blurred or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnets are depicted in a cartoon style, which inherently simplifies details. Despite this, the blouse appears smooth and symmetrical, suggesting intentional design choices. The embroidered patterns, as expected in cartoon depictions, are not as detailed as real-life representations, but they remain recognizable without appearing blurred or fragmented. Thus, the artistic representation maintains clarity and symmetry.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the lehenga magnet evenly spaced and symmetrically arranged, with no broken or misaligned designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lehenga magnet in Image B shows cartoon-like patterns that are symmetrically arranged, reflecting an even spacing. Although simplified, the designs are consistently arranged without appearing broken or misaligned, as typically seen in cartoon illustrations intending to capture essence rather than intricate details.",

      "question": "Does the red dupatta magnet show a natural curve at the edge, with the border pattern consistently aligned and not stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon representation of the red dupatta magnet includes a natural curve at the edge. The simplified border pattern appears consistently aligned, indicative of the style of cartoons which maintain thematic design elements without stretching or distortion.",

      "question": "Are the jewelry elements (maang tikka, earrings, bangles) depicted with clear outlines and consistent metallic sheen, without merged or malformed components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry elements in Image B are represented with clear outlines typical of cartoon illustrations. These provide consistent metallic hints which, despite lacking detailed sheen due to the style, are well-defined without merging or malformation. The cartoon style emphasizes outline clarity over intricate metallic reflections.",

      "question": "Is the background wall pattern magnet composed of repeated motifs that are evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not include a complex background pattern like Image A. Therefore, the question is not applicable as cartoon characters are often isolated without background motifs similar to what is depicted in real-life images.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnets are all purposefully designed with rounded edges, adhering to the common stylistic approach in cartoon rendering. The surfaces appear glossy with uniform sheen, catering to aesthetic consistency without uneven reflections or dull spots, typical of stylized cartoon art.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B shows six distinct magnets positioned side-by-side and top-to-bottom without overlap, each occupying its own space clearly defined within the image. The layout provides enough spacing for each magnet to be distinguished visually, aligned with common display practices for clarity.",
