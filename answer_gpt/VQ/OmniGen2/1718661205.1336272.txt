    "Question": "Q1: Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO model of the military ship appears well-constructed, with bricks aligning properly and maintaining a realistic shape for a LEGO representation. The overall proportions mimic the shape of a naval ship with a distinguishable bridge, which reflects careful attention to design without distortions, supporting the notion of a well-maintained structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO-rendered ocean is represented by blue bricks, typically designed to appear smooth and uniform as is common with LEGO sets. This does not mimic natural wave motion but rather provides an idealized and stylized representation typical in LEGO dioramas. The ocean depicted in LEGO does not possess the texture or undulations of real waves.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
    "explanation": "The accessories on the LEGO boat, such as the characters and smaller elements, appear proportionate to each other and are typical of LEGO design ethics where scale is consistent with minifigures and general design aesthetics. This maintains the visual coherence, making the accessories look appropriately scaled within the context of the LEGO diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
    "explanation": "Upon inspection, the LEGO model does not show any visible artifacts or flaws like jagged lines or misaligned bricks. The construction appears complete and cohesive with all bricks snugly fitting together, signifying a well-built model with no distractions breaking the illusion.",
    "answer": "No"
