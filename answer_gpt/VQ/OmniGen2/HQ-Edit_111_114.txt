    "Question": "Q3: Are the edges of the image softly degraded with a smooth transition into white, without abrupt lines or visible masking artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions at the edges are clear and maintain a smooth blend into white. There are no abrupt lines or masking artifacts visible, allowing for a clean and aesthetically pleasing presentation. This technique mirrors the treatment in Image A, indicating purposeful and skillful design.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the art-nouveau frame surround the image without overlapping or cutting through the man’s face, scooter, or any background structures?",
    "explanation": "Image B features an art-nouveau frame that carefully surrounds the man and the scene without intrusion. It avoids overlapping the main elements like the man's figure and the scooter, confining itself to the periphery in a decorative manner. In contrast, Image A does not have such a frame, which highlights this distinct choice in presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blank writing area is perfectly aligned beneath the image, maintaining a horizontal orientation. It stays clear of the scooter’s base and the ground line, ensuring a clean separation for potential content. This part of the design is unique to Image B as Image A lacks such a feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the parchment texture appear uniformly across the image without causing blurring, ghosting, or obscuration of fine details like the man’s beard or window shutters?",

Key elements like clothing textures and window details remain distinct and clear. This uniformity is intentional, as seen by comparing to Image A, which lacks such a texture, focusing more on a realistic rather than parchment style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature any element such as postcards stacked with twine or suggest any physical binding, as it focuses on a single image presentation mainly surrounded by a decorative frame. Therefore, this part of the question is not applicable to the current design elements present in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"
