    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar proportionally sized and positioned in a way that maintains the original rectangular shape of the bars without distorting their geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each cereal bar is given facial features and tiny hands that are scaled appropriately to fit within the bounds of the rectangular shape of the bars. Despite these additions, the overall rectangular geometry of each bar is preserved. Common sense indicates that proportions are maintained when features fit neatly within the object without causing distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cereal bar characters appear to interact with the pink flamingo mug in a physically plausible manner, such as touching or leaning toward it, without violating spatial logic or causing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal bar characters are illustrated alongside the pink flamingo mug but do not show any physical interaction such as touching or leaning towards it. They maintain their positions separate from the mug, which follows spatial logic as no visual inconsistencies arise from their placement.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the whimsical font placed above the cereal bar characters clearly legible, properly aligned, and free from artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whimsical font in Image B is bold and clear, appropriately sized for the space above the cereal bars, and the alignment is orderly, maintaining clarity without artifacts like jagged edges or blurring. Based on general typography knowledge, legible fonts are recognized by their clean outlines and appropriate character spacing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added facial features and hands on the cereal bars preserve the original texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, without introducing unnatural smoothness, sharp edges, or missing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and hands are integrated onto the cereal bars, but they inherently change the texture from a natural cereal and chocolate appearance to a cartoon-like smoothness. Details like sharp edges are conceptually added as part of the graphic design of the characters, deviating from the original textured appearance in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tiny hands added to the cereal bars have a natural number of fingers (no more than five), proper curvature, and appropriate shadowing to match the lighting in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiny hands on the cereal bars in Image B seem to be cartoonish in style without a clear indication of the full number of fingers, showing stylized curvature. Examining lighting and shadows in a cartoon representation suggests that these elements are generally adapted for style rather than realistic shadowing.",
