      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot's body exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in the edited image show the robot's body characterized by sleek, uninterrupted chrome-like surfaces. The material transitions appear smooth and consistent, which is typical for a stylistically geometric and polished representation of a robot. This aligns with common design principles for representing mechanical objects with continuous surfaces.",

      "question": "Are the flamingos rendered as cohesive geometric shapes with consistent edges and proportions, without fragmented or disconnected components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the flamingos are depicted with clear geometric shapes. The edges and proportions are consistent, and there are no visible fragmented or disconnected components. This suggests a stylized rendering where the flamingos are designed to look uniform and cohesive.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and rocks in the background have angular, stylized forms that maintain consistent perspective and spatial relationships without appearing disjointed or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the palm trees and rocks with angular, stylized forms. They are integrated seamlessly within the scene, maintaining consistent perspective and spatial relationships. There are no indications of disjointed or floating elements, which ensures visual coherence and supports a unified aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette across the entire scene consistently muted and pastel-toned, with no areas exhibiting sudden or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the overall color palette is simple and pastel-toned. The colors are muted and consistent throughout the scene, without any sudden or jarring deviations. This choice contributes to a harmonious and stylized visual effect, reflecting a smooth and aesthetically pleasing design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the robot's hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or malformed digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the robot with hands that each have exactly five fingers. The fingers exhibit natural curvature and spacing, with no evident extra or malformed digits. This follows typical human anatomical structure, ensuring a realistic portrayal despite the robot's mechanical nature.",
