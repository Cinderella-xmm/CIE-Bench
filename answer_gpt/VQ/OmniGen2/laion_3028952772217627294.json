      "question": "Are the stitches on the cactusâ€™s body and sombrero clearly visible, evenly spaced, and consistent with the knitting style of the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the stitches on the cactus and sombrero are clearly visible and appear to be evenly spaced. They are consistent with the knitting style observed on the donkey, which displays similar stitching patterns. This suggests careful attention to detail in the crafting of knitted products, reflecting typical knitting practices where stitches are uniformly distributed to ensure consistency.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the cactus and donkey with limbs and body proportions that appear natural and characteristic of plush toy design. The proportions are preserved, and there is no evidence of unnatural stretching or shrinking, which maintains the aesthetic and structural integrity expected in such designs.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box is positioned behind the cactus and donkey, integrating seamlessly into the scene. The lighting and shadow directions are consistent across the box and the plush toys, suggesting that they are part of the same unified scene, which enhances the coherence and perception of the setup as a cohesive display.",
