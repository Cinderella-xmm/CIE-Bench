      "question": "Does the suit fabric display consistent texture and natural lighting without visible artifacts such as unnatural gloss or patchy areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit fabric in Image B appears smooth without any visible artifacts like unnatural gloss or patchy areas. The light reflections on the suit are consistent with the lighting in the environment, suggesting a well-integrated texture. Fabric texture should exhibit uniform lighting with appropriate shadows and highlights to give a natural appearance, which is present in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the top hat correctly scaled and positioned on the head, with the feather securely attached and casting a natural shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top hat in Image B appears correctly scaled and positioned on the head, as it sits atop the head proportionally and naturally. The feather attached to the hat casts a shadow that aligns with the light source's direction, indicating that both the scale and positioning are effectively integrated into the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background fully integrated with the figure, showing no visible edges or mismatches in lighting or style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B blends seamlessly with the figure. There are no visible edges or mismatching lighting or style; the scene's overall tone is consistent throughout. This indicates a well-integrated image where the lighting and artistic style across elements align cohesively.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trousers drape naturally over the legs with appropriate folds and creases, matching the figure’s posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trousers display natural folds and creases consistent with the figure’s posture. The draping reflects a realistic representation of how fabric behaves when worn, as the creases follow the contours of the legs without appearing rigid or unnaturally uniform, which is characteristic of natural fabric behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the high collar and cravat properly aligned with the neck and face, without overlapping or deforming the skin or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The high collar and cravat in Image B are properly aligned with the neck, showing no deformation or unnatural overlap over facial features. The alignment follows the natural curve of the neck, and the cravat is positioned in a manner typical for such attire, indicating a clear and realistic integration with the figure.",
