      "question": "Do the chibi-fied players maintain a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures or artefacts that disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-fied players are designed using bold outlines, bright colors, and simplified features. Chibi characters are stylized to appear cute and caricature-like, which inherently introduces a non-realistic texture. Although they are artistically cohesive within their design, they stand out distinctly from any realistic settings due to their highly exaggerated and simplified features. Because chibi designs depart from realism, they may not blend naturally with realistic environments like pastures. Thus, their presence does introduce an unnatural element in terms of texture and scene coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outfits and hairstyles of the chibi-fied players proportionally and physically rational, avoiding any distortion that conflicts with the natural appearance of the players?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-fied players in Image B have outfits and hairstyles typical for stylized characters, with exaggerated proportions like oversized heads and small bodies. This is standard for chibi art which purposefully distorts for stylistic reasons, creating a charming but unrealistic appearance. While they are proportionally consistent within chibi paradigms, they do not align with proportions of naturally drawn humans.",

      "question": "Does the act of the chibi-fied players holding tennis rackets and shaking hands seem structurally consistent and free from deformation, fitting naturally into the pastoral setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters hold rackets and are engaged in a handshaking gesture, typical of an interaction in a tennis context. However, their exaggerated proportions and cartoonish style define their structural appearance, which would not naturally fit in a realistic pastoral setting due to this stylization. Therefore, while their action is structurally consistent within the chibi form, it doesn't naturally integrate with a realistic environment like the pasture seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the semi-transparent court logo in the background appear naturally integrated and does not introduce any visual distractions or distortions that detract from the sceneâ€™s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There appears to be no semi-transparent court logo in Image B, which is a stylized graphic of two chibi characters. Hence, without additional visual elements like a logo imposed on the pictorial scene, there are no related distractions. The scene's authenticity is primarily influenced by the chibi characters themselves, not from a stated logo.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the inclusion of chibi-fied players with tennis rackets and the court logo maintain the image's compositional balance and visual plausibility, without disrupting the natural arrangement of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inclusion of chibi-fied players introduces a significant stylistic shift compared to the realistic setting of Image A. Chibi characters are designed with emphasis on exaggerated and whimsical features, which disrupts the compositional balance found in realistic pastoral scenes due to their stark contrast and thematic divergence. As such, this editing disrupts the natural balance, posing a juxtaposition rather than integration.",
