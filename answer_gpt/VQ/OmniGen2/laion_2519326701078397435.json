      "question": "Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheels are integrated into the figure's hair, adding a mechanical element to the sculpture. To evaluate integration, I observe whether these cogwheels blend smoothly into the sculpted hair without altering the overall head shape or creating surface inconsistencies. The cogwheels show a seamless incorporation into the existing silhouette, with no apparent breaks or unnatural protrusions disrupting the scalp's continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic elements that represent fabric and mechanical parts are designed to conform closely to the figure's form. I assess whether the folds and contours replicate how fabric would naturally drape over the body and if mechanical additions like rivets and tubes are placed where they would logically exist. The drapery mimics natural curves without awkward distortions, and mechanical elements are placed in positions that suggest functional connectivity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I inspect how the modified watch parts and gears are arranged at the base of the sculpture. I determine stability by checking for a symmetrical layout, ensuring no components appear to be awkwardly placed or unanchored, which would defy gravity. The components are systematically oriented, resting in a balanced configuration that adheres to physical norms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I examine the alignment and attachment of the monocle mechanism. Analyzing how it sits against the eye socket, I look for visible mounting that makes mechanical sense while ensuring no distortion to the adjacent facial features. The monocle integrates well with the sculpture's design, using joints that seem practically engineered to fit without modifying the underlying structure of the face.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, I evaluate the consistency and realism of the bronze and copper coloration across the surface. True metallic application involves even color distribution, varied reflections, and avoidance of jarring lines or dull patches. The image displays a uniform metallic sheen, with reflections indicating a three-dimensional surface, and colors shift naturally without abrupt transitions.",
