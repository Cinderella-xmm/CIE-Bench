      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the atom illustration placed in the same location as the original dough and does it have a smooth, continuous edge without jagged lines or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atom illustrations are part of a chart that is arranged in a grid format, unlike Image A, where a single dough imprint is shown. The illustrations in Image B are positioned as part of a sequence rather than the same single location as the original dough in Image A. The atom shapes do appear smooth and continuous in Image B, following a neat and clear design with no jagged lines or gaps. This suggests that while the position is different, the quality of the edges is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the additional atom-shaped cookies the same size as the original dough and do they have colors that blend naturally with the beige dough and wooden background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies are depicted in various sizes and colors—red, blue, orange, and green—distinctly different from the beige color of the dough in Image A. This differentiation in color makes the cookies stand out rather than blend in with the beige dough or the wooden background. Additionally, the size of these cookies varies and does not conform to the size of the original dough shown in Image A, indicating a deliberate intent to differentiate each element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arrows point directly to the correct parts of the atom (electrons, protons, neutrons) without crossing over or distorting the atomic shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, arrows are used to indicate specific parts of the atom illustrations, such as electrons and neutrons. These arrows appear to be accurately directed at their respective parts without crossing over the illustrations in a way that distorts the atomic shape. The arrows are neat and clearly convey the intended association with the subatomic particles marked as 'electrons' or 'neutrons'.",

      "question": "Is the title text \"Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry\" clearly visible, positioned above the illustrations, and does it not overlap with the atom shapes or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry' in Image B is positioned at the top of the image above the illustrations, serving as a header. It is prominently displayed and does not overlap with any of the atom shapes or the cookie cutters. The placement ensures that it remains legible and distinct from the visual elements below.",

      "question": "Are the dotted lines straight, uniformly spaced, and positioned between sections without covering the atom illustrations or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dotted lines are used to divide the sections containing different atom illustrations. These lines are straight and uniformly spaced, ensuring a clear separation between sections. The lines are positioned such that they do not cover or interfere with any of the atomic illustrations or the cookie cutter shapes, preserving the integrity and layout of the visual content.",
