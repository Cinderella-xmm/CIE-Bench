      "question": "Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style models of both the sheep and clock appear to be well-rendered with appropriate textures that fit a miniature or playful aesthetic commonly seen in snow globes. The sheep looks fluffy and proportionate as expected from a soft toy or miniature model, with details like its ears and fur texture prominently visible. Similarly, the clock maintains a shiny, smooth surface with gold-tone details that are consistent and free from distortions. Based on these observations and the characteristics of commonly accepted chibi or toy models, both objects display natural textures and fine details without appearing unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sheep appear naturally leaning against the clock without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep and clock are positioned side by side within a snow globe. The sheep does not seem to be leaning against the clock; rather, it stands next to it. The positioning appears stable without any visual distortion or awkward leaning. The sheep's posture looks balanced, which suggests that there are no unnatural spatial relationships or positioning distortions observed within the globe.",

      "question": "Do the gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe add to the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene inside the snow globe in Image B features snowflakes that seem to be gently floating in a manner typically associated with snow globes. These flakes do not show signs of artificial manipulation like awkward accumulation or non-uniformity that would break the illusion of drifting snow. The particles are evenly dispersed and vary slightly in size, enhancing the overall visual appeal and natural feeling of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the wooden tabletop and warm, neutral-toned background create a visually harmonious and cozy atmosphere without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is resting on a wooden tabletop that displays realistic grain and tone representative of natural wood. The background is warm and neutral, which complements the foreground objects and creates a cozy, inviting atmosphere. The lighting seems consistent with the tone, casting soft shadows and enhancing the warmth of the scene without showing any abrupt color shifts or visual inconsistencies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop consistent and logical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportion of the sheep and clock inside the snow globe seems appropriate for a miniature representation, maintaining a believable ratio of size to each other within the confines of the globe. The snow globe itself is correctly sized relative to the tabletop, suggesting these objects fit logically within the real-world constraints. The physical placement and proportions appear coherent, with no distortions in size or proximity that would render the scene inconsistent.",
