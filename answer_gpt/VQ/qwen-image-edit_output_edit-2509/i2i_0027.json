      "question": "Does the dog's body maintain a natural and structurally consistent pose in the chibi-style, without any noticeable distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog presents an exaggerated chibi-style characteristic, such as a disproportionately large head and simplified features, which is typical for this art style. Despite these changes, the dog's body maintains a natural pose consistent with the chibi design, without any noticeable distortion or deformation. The design adheres to the expectations of chibi styling, where proportions are intentionally altered but remain structurally consistent for the style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the enlarged head been integrated naturally into the image, without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The enlarged head in Image B reflects the typical chibi-style with simplified and exaggerated features. This includes an oversized head with large, glossy eyes. The texture is smooth and consistent with the plastic-like appearance often seen in collectible figures. There are no apparent artifacts or unnatural textures disrupting the integration of the head with the rest of the model, which results in a cohesive visualization that aligns with chibi figure design.",

      "question": "Is the tennis ball touching the dog's nose in a way that looks natural and physically plausible, without any awkward positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is positioned directly in front of the dog's nose, fitting seamlessly into the character's mouth area as typical for toy figurines, indicating interaction. The positioning appears plausible within the context of the chibi-style design where such interactions are often simplified for aesthetics. The arrangement avoids awkward positioning, contributing to the image's natural look even with stylized elements.",

      "question": "Does the relief tennis ball pattern on the base match well with the rest of the scene, contributing to a cohesive and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B features a relief tennis ball pattern that matches well with the theme of the scene, where the dog is interacting with a ball. The pattern is integrated smoothly into the base without any visual discrepancies, helping to enhance the aesthetic continuity of the figurine design. Such matching motifs are common in chibi-style figures to reinforce thematic elements and render a cohesive visual experience.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the edited image retained the original focus on the ball while successfully integrating the chibi-style elements, resulting in a balanced and visually coherent composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has retained focus on the ball by presenting it prominently in front of the chibi-style dog figure, effectively capturing the viewer's attention. The integration of chibi elements does not detract from this central focus but rather complements it, as the exaggerated features draw the viewer's eye naturally towards the dog and the resting ball. The composition maintains a balance between the chibi-style dog and the tennis ball, achieving a visually coherent and balanced appearance.",
