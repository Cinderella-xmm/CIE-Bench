    "Question": "Q1: Does the bread slice retain a natural crumb texture and crust edge without visible smoothing or unnatural distortion?",
    "explanation": "Based on the image of the bread knight in Image B, the bread slices used for the armor retain a crumb texture and crust edge that appear consistent with natural bread characteristics. The visual cues suggest a deliberate illustration style that maintains this natural appearance without any evident smoothing or distortions that would make them look artificial.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the facial features positioned within the bread slice and aligned with its surface plane, without appearing detached or floating above it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bread warrior's helmet is depicted as part of its design rather than having facial features added to a bread slice. The text 'Better' on the chest armor does not represent facial features. The alignment and integration of this text within the design are consistent, showing no signs of detachment or floating above the surface.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the lettuce leaves forming the cape show consistent leaf texture and natural curling, without flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting loss of detail?",

Instead, it has consistent texture and coloring, appropriate for a cloth cape. Hence, the evaluation of lettuce leaves does not apply here.",
