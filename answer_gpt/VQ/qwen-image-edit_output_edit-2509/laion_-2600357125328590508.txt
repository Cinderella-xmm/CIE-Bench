    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sock’s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a 3D LEGO sculpture that replicates a sock. The LEGO structure appears to follow the contours of the sock with precision, capturing the proportions as closely as possible and avoiding any visual distortions or warping that would make the proportions inconsistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO sculpture that follows the natural vertical shape and curves typically associated with a sock. The layers of LEGO bricks seem to be consistently aligned, maintaining a smooth flow without visible gaps or misalignments, which is crucial for accurately mimicking the sock’s design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the 'UNO' text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO sculpture uses black, gray, and white bricks that closely mirror the pattern seen on the original sock, including the complicated "UNO" text and accent stripes. The arrangement appears consistent with the sock's design, hence there is no visible color mismatch or inconsistencies in pattern layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
    "explanation": "The orange LEGO piece is positioned at the top of the sculpture, similar to the sock’s original design. It is integrated into the LEGO structure in a manner that doesn't appear detached or artificially suspended, maintaining a natural positioning as part of the sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
    "explanation": "The setting of Image B shows the LEGO sock sculpture against a clean, uniform background, which helps to accentuate its 3D form. The lighting appears even, without casting unnatural shadows or reflections, facilitating clear visibility of the sculpture's details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
