      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the monocled eye on the front face of the clock seamlessly integrated into the original frame, with no visible seam or texture discontinuity around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocled eye is prominently positioned in the center of the front face of the clock-like structure. Analyzing the integration, the eye is encased in a round frame that blends well with the surrounding metallic structure, displaying no noticeable seams or mismatched textures. The golden hue of the material and the mechanical style are consistent with the rest of the edited figure, suggesting a seamless transition consistent with a well-executed editing technique. Common sense indicates that a well-integrated edit would avoid abrupt edges, and this image's smooth integration supports this.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gear-like limbs extend from the side panels of the clock with continuous material flow and geometric alignment, showing no signs of floating or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gear-like limbs are extended from the sides of the clock structure. Observing the way these limbs connect to the main body, they appear to emerge seamlessly without visible gaps or misaligned joints, demonstrating a continuous material flow. The positioning and angles at which the limbs attach suggest a thoughtful geometric alignment. Knowledge about mechanical design implies that well-integrated extensions would show smooth and coherent connections to the main structure, just as depicted here.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pendulum converted into a tail that extends downward from the bottom center of the clock, maintaining a smooth curvature and consistent material texture with the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a pendulum, a tail-like extension protrudes from the clock structure. This 'tail' appears mechanically fabricated with a coiling shape and is visually consistent with the steampunk theme of the object. It extends naturally from the body, maintaining a smooth curvature. The material texture of both the tail and the rest of the edited object features a unified metallic finish in terms of color and surface reflectivity, suggesting a consistent design approach typical of well-crafted mechanical enhancements.",

      "question": "Are the brass and copper tones applied uniformly across the clock’s surface, matching the lighting direction and showing realistic reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a predominantly steampunk aesthetic with brass and copper tones dominating its appearance. These tones appear uniform throughout the clock-like structure, including the main body and the extensions like the limbs and the eye frame. The lighting in the image casts consistent shadows and reflections that align with a single light source direction, enhancing the realism of the material's glossy finish. Since world knowledge about lighting suggests that realistic reflections would match the light's direction, the maintained cohesiveness in lighting enhances the image's visual authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the steam valves placed at each corner of the clock’s upper section, protruding outward with clean edges and no overlap or deformation of the surrounding structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam valves are visible at the corners of the clock-like structure's upper section. These valves extend clearly from the body in a manner that maintains distinct and clean edges, free from overlap or distortion with nearby elements of the structure. Each valve possesses a defined and proportional shape, complementing the mechanical theme. The image thus displays a level of detailed precision consistent with intricate mechanical design norms, where such components are crafted to seamlessly integrate without causing structural overlap.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns along the clock’s base and sides clear, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the original ornamental design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains engraved patterns along the base and sides of the edited clock figure, which are visually similar in style to traditional ornamental designs. These engravings appear sharp, with clear detailing that suggests careful attention to design quality. They are distributed evenly, contributing to a consistent and visually holistic aesthetic. The intricate design aligns with common knowledge about decorative art where consistency and clarity in engraving are paramount. Therefore, the stylistic harmony observed indicates the engravings are well-crafted and cohesively integrated.",
