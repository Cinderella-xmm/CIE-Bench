      "question": "Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the figurine appears to have a uniform glossy finish typical of ceramic materials. The gloss is even across the surface, indicating polished ceramic rather than a knit texture, which is more matte and irregular. Ceramic materials often have a smooth, reflective surface which is evident in this image.",

      "question": "Is the terracotta color applied uniformly across the entire body of the figurine, without streaks, discoloration, or mismatched tones in different areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terracotta color appears consistent across the entire body of the figurine. There are no visible streaks, discolorations, or mismatched tones. The color seamlessly covers the figurine, indicating a uniform application expected of ceramic glazing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral engravings clearly defined, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly embedded into the surface of the figurine without causing geometric distortions or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral engravings on the figurine in Image B are clearly defined and proportionally scaled. They appear integrated into the surface, maintaining geometric consistency without distortions or overlapping. This suggests careful craftsmanship typically seen in ceramic work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the amber-colored eyes have a smooth, polished appearance with appropriate reflection and depth, and are they correctly positioned within the facial structure without appearing displaced or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the amber-colored eyes of the figurine have a smooth, polished appearance with a reflective quality, suggesting depth. They are correctly positioned within the facial structure, aligning well with the proportions of the figurine's face.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the figurine resting flat on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and natural shadowing beneath it, indicating proper physical support and spatial coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is shown resting flat on a wooden surface, evident from the visible wood grain beneath it. There is natural shadowing beneath the figurine, which indicates proper physical support and spatial coherence consistent with real-world physics.",
