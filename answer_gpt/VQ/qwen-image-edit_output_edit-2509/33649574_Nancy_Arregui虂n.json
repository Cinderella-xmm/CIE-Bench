    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the feathers exhibit smooth, continuous gradients of fiery coloration without visible banding, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers of the rooster show a smooth gradient transitioning from vibrant reds and oranges to deeper hues, resembling flames. This continuously flowing gradient suggests attention to detail in avoiding visual artifacts such as banding or pixelation. The use of bright colors and smooth transitions implies a deliberate artistic effect to emulate fiery coloration, consistent with well-rendered digital art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tail smoothly transform into smoke-like tendrils without abrupt cutoffs or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail in Image B artistically extends into smoke-like tendrils, smoothly transitioning from the vivid feather colors to a softer, semi-transparent smoke effect. This indicates a seamless visual design, intended to portray the tail as continuously flowing into smoke without noticeable breaks, aligning with digital art practices of depicting magical or mythical transformations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the molten gold accents seamlessly blended into the wing and crest surfaces, showing depth and reflection consistent with metallic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents appear integrated within the rooster's wings and crest, possessing a reflective quality that suggests depth and bimetallic texture. The blending of these accents showcases an understanding of metallic visual properties, hinting at the artistry put into creating realistic-looking gold that interacts naturally with light.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the flame-like eyes maintain the original eye shape and size, with no distortion of the surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation of the rooster's eyes in Image B to resemble flames keeps the original anatomical structure in mind. Despite the dramatic style, the eyes do not deviate significantly in shape or size from what would be anatomically expected for a rooster, and the surrounding facial features are not distorted, maintaining realistic proportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the rune patterns clearly visible but not oversized or warped, preserving the natural shape and texture of the talons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rune patterns on the talons in Image B are detailed and appropriately scaled, maintaining the natural contours and texture of the talons. These patterns are integrated into the talons without altering their basic shape or causing any visual distortion, indicating a thoughtful approach to adding intricate design elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rooster’s body posture and limb alignment preserved, with no stretching, compression, or misplacement of limbs relative to the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rooster's posture in Image B seems to be consistent with a natural stance. The body and limbs are proportionally aligned as expected for a rooster, with no visible signs of stretching, compression, or misalignment, ensuring that the overall anatomy remains logical and visually coherent even with the artistic enhancements.",
