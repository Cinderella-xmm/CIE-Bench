    "Question": "Q1: Does the front view of the apple maintain its original texture and color without any noticeable artifacts or unnatural smoothing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the apple shows a bright red color with visible small dots, likely indicating natural speckles on the apple's skin. There are no apparent signs of artifacts or smoothing that alter the texture, as the details appear consistent with how an apple naturally looks in real life.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?",
    "explanation": "In the cross-section view in Image B, the apple's flesh displays a natural and detailed appearance, showing typical characteristics such as seeds and varying textures around them. The flesh's surface has expected characteristics, and there is no sign of it being overly smooth or artificial, which would otherwise detract from its natural look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the top view of the apple’s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In the top view of Image B, the apple’s stem appears naturally protruding from the top in a realistic manner, with appropriate proportions related to the apple’s size. The calyx and stem maintain consistency with typical apple structure, and there are no distortions or artifacts," 
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the apple's shapes, sizes, and textures are consistent across all views: the front view, the cross-section, and the top view. The smooth skin in the front and the detailed flesh texture in the cross-section match what would be seen naturally in an apple. Each part harmonizes to provide a coherent overall appearance, maintaining structural consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all views of the apple show a consistency in lighting, with soft shadows and highlights suggesting natural light falling on the apple. The cross-section and top view maintain the same warmth and intensity of lighting and shadows as seen in the front view, reinforcing the unified appearance of the apple across views.",
    "answer": "Yes"
