      "question": "Is the white studio background uniformly flat and free of shadows, texture mismatches, or visible edges where it meets the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a smooth white studio setting designed to highlight products without distractions. The toy sits inside a packaging box, which is also uniformly flat and well-defined. Typically, such white backgrounds are engineered to be clean and free from any visible features, allowing the focus to remain on the item. The background appears uniformly flat without any texture mismatches or visible edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the logo tag on the hippo’s ear properly aligned with the knit texture, showing realistic thread stitching and no unnatural color or shape distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo tag is attached to the hippo's ear with a realism typical of toy designs, where branding tags are sewn or tied on. The tag's alignment and integration into the fabric texture suggest a seamless attachment, with clear stitching and colors that appear natural without distortion. The smooth transition indicates proper alignment with the knit texture of the toy.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the circular patch on the hippo’s side have consistent knit texture and thickness with the surrounding fabric, without raised or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patch on the hippo's side in Image B seems to be an integral part of the toy's fabric. Typically, such patches, especially on knitted toys, are designed to seamlessly blend into the surrounding material, indicating consistency in texture and thickness. The absence of any raised or detached appearance suggests a consistent knit texture and integration with the overall design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned behind the toy at a natural distance, with consistent lighting and shadow alignment that matches the direction of light on the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box contains the toy; hence its position is inherently correct relative to the toy's placement. The lighting within the box is uniformly distributed, matching the studio environment's typical lighting settings that avoid heavy shadows and ensure the product is well-lit from all angles, maintaining a natural look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plastic window on the box front transparent with subtle reflections and no distortion of the toy’s image visible through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a packaging box with a transparent plastic window, designed to offer a clear view of the toy inside. The transparency allows the toy’s features to be visible without any visual distortion, and subtle reflections on such windows are typical to enhance realism and present the item as intended.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text elements clearly visible, correctly spaced, and rendered with smooth edges without jaggedness or overlapping with other objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements on the packaging box in Image B are designed to be legible and visually pleasing, with smooth edges and appropriate spacing. Clearly visible and well-rendered text ensures that branding is effectively communicated, without any overlap or unwanted jaggedness, which are typical of well-designed product packaging.",
