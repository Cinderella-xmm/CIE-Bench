      "question": "Are the wing-shaped shelves formed from the original bookshelves smooth and continuous without jagged edges or missing segments, and do they feature leaf textures that blend naturally with the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the central bird and other birds appear smooth and continuous, and their textures resemble natural leaf patterns associated with feathers, displaying a blend between wood and leaf-like textures. In Image A, the bookshelves were regular rectangular shapes. Thus, the transformation to the wing shape is quite seamless and natural, without jagged edges or missing segments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hanging fungi occupy the same positions as the original lamps, have rounded caps and stems resembling real mushrooms, and display a soft glow without visible artifacts or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mushrooms hang from the trees at positions comparable to where the pendants were positioned in Image A. The mushrooms have rounded caps and stems, resembling real mushrooms, and they emit a soft glow. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural brightness gradients in Image B. In Image A, original lamps are in similar positions, supporting the consistency in placement.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chair and stool replacements shaped like natural rocks with uneven surfaces and moss coverage that follows realistic growth patterns, and do they retain a size suitable for human seating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, objects on the forest floor are shaped like rocks and have uneven surfaces, with moss covering them in a realistic manner. These rocks appear to be of a size that could suggest they are functional replacements for human seating, considering their dimensions compared to the birds. In Image A, chairs and stools were the original objects providing seating.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the book-to-bird transformations show complete bird bodies with defined heads, wings, and tails, and do the feathers contain readable text fragments arranged in a natural pattern without distorted letters or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are completely formed with defined heads, wings, and tails. However, the feathers do not display readable text fragments; they do not show any text patterns at all but rather appear natural without distortion or gaps. Therefore, there's no text fragment transformation visible in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the entwined branches forming the ceiling connected and interlaced in a natural way without gaps or floating segments, and do they cast shadow patterns that align with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features trees with naturally interlaced branches, reflecting an interconnected natural setup, without any visible gaps or floating segments. The lighting in Image B comes from overhead, creating shadows that follow the direction of light seen through the trees. In Image A, the ceiling had a patterned shadow, suggesting a light source above, aligning with Image B's approach.",
