      "question": "Does the transformed lantern maintain its original symmetrical shape and geometric proportions without visible distortion or broken lattice patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a rectangular golden box with decorative elements on its surface, which is different from the lantern seen in traditional marketplaces. The box design incorporates symmetrical patterns and geometric shapes, maintaining continuity in its lattice and ornamental design. The design is clean, with no visible distortion or broken lattice patterns. This indicates that the transformation into a packaging design carefully preserved the symmetrical appearance.",

      "question": "Is the metallic embossed flame logo on the lantern's surface consistent with the surrounding material, showing realistic depth and reflections without unnatural edges or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the metallic embossed flame logo is integrated into the surface of the box. The embossing appears consistent with the overall design, displaying realistic depth with appropriate shadowing and light reflection. There are no visible inconsistencies or abrupt color changes, indicating a well-executed integration process without unnatural edges.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the marketplace elements converted into side textures of the packaging clearly recognizable as derived from the original scene but stylized appropriately, without distortion or loss of fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sides of the packaging do not directly depict detailed elements from the original marketplace scene but rather use stylized ornamental designs that are consistent with the theme of the marketplace setting. These designs focus on maintaining a traditional, intricate look rather than duplicating the scene's elements. There is no indication of distortion or loss of detail given the decorative and abstract representation, indicating appropriate stylization without lowering the quality of detail.",

      "question": "Do the deep gold and amber tones applied to the packaging blend naturally with the existing lighting and material colors, avoiding harsh transitions or unnatural glow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The deep gold and amber tones applied to the packaging in Image B have a rich and smooth appearance. These tones blend seamlessly with the lighting, enhancing the reflective quality of the metallic surface. The color transitions are smooth, with no indication of harsh edges or unnatural glow effects, which suggests a careful and deliberate color application process.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scented candle silhouette positioned correctly on the packaging front, maintaining proper scale and alignment with the surrounding design elements without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the candle flame on the front of the packaging in Image B is centered within a decorative frame, maintaining alignment with the design's geometric framework. The scale of the flame appears appropriate to the size of the packaging and in harmony with the surrounding design elements, lacking any visual artifacts such as misalignments or awkward scaling. This indicates careful design consideration.",
