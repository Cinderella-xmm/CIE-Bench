    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horseâ€™s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the showcase box enclosing the horse appears to align well with the horse's outline. The transparency is uniform, without evident warping or bending of the box's edges that could distort the view. There's no visible double imaging or light refraction that can alter how the horse appears within the showcase, indicating the box is designed with precision. This assessment is based on the visual symmetry and clarity provided by the transparent materials used.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents on the corners and edges of the showcase box are consistently colored and exhibit reflective properties characteristic of polished metal. These elements show a smooth finish with controlled highlights that enhance their metallic look, and do not exhibit any color bleeding or irregular reflection that would diminish the perception of high-quality material.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo on the black base stand is centrally positioned and its design is distinct. The logo retains clarity without pixelation or blurring, affirming the professionalism in its presentation. Its neat execution ensures it can be easily identified and appreciated, reflecting an emphasis on brand visibility.",

      "question": "Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B reveals that the internal backdrop pattern matches the box's perspective seamlessly. The details retain continuity without showing any signs of distortion, tiling errors, or inappropriate cuts at the edges. The design reflects careful construction matching the box's structure, providing a visually coherent backdrop.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The magnetic closure mechanism on the showcase box in Image B appears integrated as part of the box's structure, holding tight without noticeable gaps or overlaps. The visual presentation suggests a plausible mechanical design that aligns well with the straightforward purpose of securing the box, free from any impossible or illogical elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse sculpture is enclosed within a transparent box that allows each detail to be visible without obstruction. Key features like the head, legs, saddle, and painted sections are clearly presented and illuminated by the showcase without unnecessary blockage by packaging elements, ensuring that the sculpture remains the central focus within its protective environment.",
