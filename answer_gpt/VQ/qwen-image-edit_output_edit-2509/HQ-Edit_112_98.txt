    "Question": "Q1: Do the petal-like feathers on the sparrow’s body exhibit smooth transitions in pink gradient without visible pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the petal-like feathers on the bird's body show a well-rendered pink gradient. This can be observed through the gradual shading from deeper to lighter pink hues across the feathers. The gradient is smooth, indicating no visible pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts. Such a smooth transition suggests a high-quality digital rendering, where colors blend seamlessly, maintaining a realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the blossom patterns on the wings aligned with the natural feather structure and do they avoid overlapping or warping of existing feather edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows blossom patterns on the bird’s wings that are integrated harmoniously with the wing structure. The floral motifs align with the wings' feather arrangement, maintaining the natural contours without visibly overlapping or warping the feather edges. This successful alignment depends on customarily layering designs in digital art to match the original subject’s structure while maintaining aesthetic integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the cascading cherry blossom tail emerge naturally from the base of the original tail and follow a downward flow that matches the bird’s posture without floating or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom tail starts at the base of the bird’s tail, seamlessly extending downward in a manner that complements the bird’s posture. The design mirrors the natural gravitational pull and flows consistently with realistic expectations of how such elements, if real, would connect to the bird's body. This coherence with natural movement ensures the tail does not appear to float or misalign.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the vines around the sparrow’s legs follow natural curvature and thickness proportional to the leg size, without penetrating or distorting the foot structure?",
    "explanation": "The vines wrapped around the bird’s legs in Image B show logical curvature and thickness that appear proportional to the size of the bird’s legs. The vines are visually coherent, appearing soft with no evident penetration or distortion of the foot structure. Such detailing requires consideration of how supplementary elements should naturally interact with anatomical features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the dewdrop ornaments on the chest positioned realistically on the surface of the feathers and do they reflect light consistently with surrounding lighting conditions?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents dewdrop ornaments on the bird's chest, which are positioned as if adhering naturally to the feather surface. They reflect light realistically, consistent with the surrounding lighting conditions as suggested by the overall bright and soft illumination of the scene. This implies careful integration of highlights and shadows in digital rendering to achieve a realistic look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
