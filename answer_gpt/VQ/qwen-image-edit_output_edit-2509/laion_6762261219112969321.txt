    "Question": "Q1: Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa's surfaces are depicted using cloud textures, which give a soft and fluffy appearance. These cloud formations are naturally soft and pillowy with inherent layering due to their composition of water droplets or ice crystals. There are no visual cues of any flat or blocky regions, suggesting a continuous and consistent portrayal of clouds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa appears to have a transformed structure where the wooden frame and legs are replaced with wind-like structures. These structures have a branching effect and seem to flow naturally akin to fluid motion, typical of air currents without sharp angles or rigid breaks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features eyes on the upper cushions, seamlessly integrated into the cloud texture. The edges of the eyes are smooth and natural, blending well into the soft cloud pattern. There are no jagged edges or stark color contrasts that would cause visual distraction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "The mist trail in Image B extends from the back of the sofa in a continuous manner. Its texture is consistent with the representations of mists and the fading intensity follows a natural gradient without any sudden breaks or boundaries that would disturb the visual continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "Despite the transformation of the material and style of the sofa in Image B, the overall structure is maintained with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base. The proportions and placement of these elements suggest no visible gaps, overlaps, or distortions, maintaining the integrity of the original geometric design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
