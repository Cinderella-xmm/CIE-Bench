    "Question": "Q4: Does the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flow smoothly in the same direction as the original wake, with colors transitioning gradually from warm orange to deep red matching the sky?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent wave pattern is depicted with bright, colorful waves that flow artistically rather than mimicking the natural pattern seen in Image A. The colors include a diverse palette that doesn't directly match the sky's warm orange to deep red gradient and instead stand out as visually distinct and vibrant. This distinguishes them as a fantastical element rather than an attempt to mimic natural water behavior or colors.",
