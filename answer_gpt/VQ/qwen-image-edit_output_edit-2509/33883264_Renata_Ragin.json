    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed towers retain the original stone texture and structural lines, and are they shaped into arms without geometric distortion or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towers have been transformed into arms of a golem. Upon analysis, the texture and structural lines of traditional architectural stone seem to be retained in the arms, accurately reflecting a stone-like appearance. The arms are distinctively shaped with definition and appear to be transformed into muscular forms without any evident distortions or unnatural breaks. Therefore, the transformation conveys continuity and preservation of the stone qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suspension cables rendered as continuous, sinewy tendons with consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest area, without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suspension cables are transformed to resemble tendons wrapping around the golem’s chest area. They maintain a consistent appearance, with a sinewy quality similar to metallic tendons. The curvature around the chest appears smooth and continuous, lacking noticeable fraying or changes in thickness, which suggests a natural adaptation of the original cables into the golem's anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower transformed into a crown with clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally and are positioned directly above the golem’s head without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Freedom Tower is transformed into a crown-like structure made of faceted crystals atop the golem’s head. The surfaces of the crystals appear to be clear and reflect light in a way that one would expect from faceted crystals. Additionally, the crown is positioned directly above the golem’s head with no signs of floating or misalignment, maintaining structural coherence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers seamlessly integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, parts of the city skyline, such as skyscrapers, have been integrated into the golem's body, resembling armor. The integration looks seamless, with the buildings fitting snugly into the golem’s structure. There are no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges, making the transformation appear smooth and intentional.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the golem’s base fully anchored to the ground and water, with no floating or disconnected limbs, and does its overall scale match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem's feet are anchored firmly on the ground near the water without any signs of floating or disconnection. The limbs, including legs and arms, are well-connected to the body. The golem’s scale is proportionate to the surrounding environment, including the visible cityscape and bridge, which maintains consistency with the surrounding elements.",
