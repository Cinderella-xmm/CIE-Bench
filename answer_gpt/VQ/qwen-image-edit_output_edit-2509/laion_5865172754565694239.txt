    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon character dressed in a Superman-like costume riding a bike. The handlebars and frame around the cartoon character’s head are part of the integrated design in the edited context. While there isn't a direct indication of mismatching seams or texture in Image B, the character's facial features are distinctly part of the cartoon design and are meant to stand out rather than blend seamlessly with the bike's surface. Thus, the integration is intentional as per the edited design, where the texture matches the art style of the cartoon image rather than the original bike surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon limbs are creatively illustrated, extending beyond the context of a typical bike ride. The limbs add an artistic flair to the image but do not appear to distort the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components. The wheels have cartoon motion lines and stylistic effects, but the basic structure of the bike components remains intact, even with the exaggerated cartoon character integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents motion lines angled forward and situated around the bike to convey speed. These lines are drawn as part of a cartoon effect and do not cross over specific bike components such as the chain, derailleur, or the “DUCATI” logo. Instead, they provide a dynamic background that mimics motion without interfering with key bike features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the bike’s basic frame design, and the added hero suit design over the character doesn’t compromise the bike’s structural integrity. The cartoon character embedded in the design doesn’t alter the dimensional aspects of the bike frame, which maintains consistency similar to how the real bike's tubular structure would appear in a non-edited setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
    "explanation": "The sound effect texts in Image B are situated strategically to evoke a sense of motion and energy typical in comic designs. They are positioned outside the key structural components of the bike, aiding in the dynamic appeal without obscuring elements such as the “DUCATI” branding or control levers. The orientation enhances the animated feel without interfering with specific bike parts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
