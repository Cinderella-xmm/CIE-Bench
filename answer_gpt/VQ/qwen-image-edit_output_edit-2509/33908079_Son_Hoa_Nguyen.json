      "question": "Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the worker appear enlarged in the drawing style typical of illustrations. However, they retain anatomically correct features such as five fingers, natural joint positions, and the absence of distorted shapes. This suggests that while the scale may be exaggerated for stylistic purposes, the anatomical details are correct. This conclusion is drawn from the visual information where each hand is shown in a natural position consistent with the action of picking leaves, and features the expected number of fingers.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green tones of the tea field are vibrant and rendered in a cartoon style that maintains consistency with natural plant colors. The gradients between different shades are smooth, without abrupt shifts or artificial-looking patches. The depiction reflects the rich green hues typical of tea plantations, which contributes to a realistic representation despite the illustrative nature of the image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the sack has a gold effect that resembles a smooth, reflective metallic layer. This appearance is achieved without the presence of jagged edges or unnatural glare, maintaining consistent lighting that complements the illustrative style. The gold foil appearance is vivid yet consistent with typical representations of metallic surfaces.",

      "question": "Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features vine-patterned borders along the edges, which are designed to follow natural leaf and stem structures. The borders are integrated into the overall composition without overlapping or clipping into the main scene, ensuring a harmonious frame around the central visuals of the image. This indicates a careful placement and design of the borders to complement, rather than disrupt, the thematic content.",

      "question": "Is the recycled paper texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or tea leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a recycled paper texture that is uniformly applied across the entire image. Despite this texture application, it does not obscure fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or the tea leaves. This uniform application of texture allows for the preservation of detail while adding a rustic background element, enhancing the visual and thematic quality of the illustration.",
