      "question": "Are the reflections on the carsâ€™ surfaces clear and consistent with their surroundings without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflections on the car surfaces are faint due to the dark, high-contrast lighting but appear consistent with the environment's reflections. The setting suggests dusk or nighttime with artificial lighting, where reflections are subdued. There are no visible unnatural artifacts on the car surfaces, which appear smooth and intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the enhanced environmental haze create a realistic atmospheric depth without blurring or distorting the structural elements of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a setting that suggests dusk or an evening environment with a dark and moody atmosphere, which inherently has a more pronounced haziness that contributes to atmospheric depth. The structural elements like traffic lights and cars remain distinct, indicating that the haze is simulated realistically without excessive blurring.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the increased contrast enhanced the visual impact without producing unnatural colors or excessive glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the increased contrast results in a more visually striking appearance, which aligns with a movie poster style. The colors, although more pronounced, do not appear unnatural within the context of a dramatically lit scene. There is no excessive glare observed that would detract from the image's realistic representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the movie poster style conversion maintain visual credibility with the traffic lights and road markings appearing undistorted and logically intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the integrity of traffic lights and road markings. Despite the cinematic style, which presents more dramatic lighting and contrast, the structural elements like traffic lights and road markings are not distorted and remain logically placed, preserving visual credibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the cars, such as paint texture and taillight designs, been preserved without introducing unnatural artifacts or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fine details of the cars, including the paint texture and taillight designs, are maintained and recognizable. The style shift to a higher contrast does not obscure these details, and they do not exhibit any unnatural artifacts or degradation that would detract from their realism.",
