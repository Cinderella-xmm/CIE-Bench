      "question": "Are the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines smooth and continuous without jagged breaks or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's spire and rooflines appear smooth and continuous. This conclusion is drawn by observing the clear lines and uniformity in the structure, which do not display any jagged breaks or warped segments. The edited image intentionally maintains these lines for coherence and aesthetic appeal, avoiding any visual inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Do the left and right halves of the church’s façade mirror each other exactly, causing any misalignment in window positions or wall contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a symmetrical alignment of the church’s façade, where the left and right halves mirror each other exactly. This symmetry is achieved as an artistic decision to avoid misalignment, which would be visually noticeable in elements like window placements and wall contours.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic gold accent on the spire in Image B exhibits a uniform and reflective appearance. This conclusion is derived from the consistent coloring and reflective quality across the gold spire, without the presence of clashing textures or unnatural glow spots, which would otherwise disrupt the cohesive look.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spire’s height is proportionally balanced with the rest of the church’s structure. The edited image has been crafted to maintain a realistic and balanced proportion, avoiding any extreme vertical stretching that would make the spire look disproportionate to the main body of the church.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a celestial background that seamlessly blends with the top edge of the church. This is achieved by ensuring smooth transitions in color and lack of disjointed elements, which avoids abrupt shifts or floating objects that can break the visual harmony.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the window frames, arch designs, and roof tile patterns remain visible and clearly defined. The editing process retains these detailed architectural elements to ensure that the main characteristics of the church's design are preserved, maintaining a detailed and refined look.",
