    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the tree in the edited image maintain natural branch proportions and trunk thickness relative to the surrounding elements, without appearing unnaturally shrunk or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree appears to be positioned within a box frame, suggesting that it is part of a crafted or artistic representation rather than a naturally occurring scene. Given this context, the proportions are intended to fit this framed setting, allowing for some creative distortion typical of diorama or shadow box art. Thus, the proportions fit the artistic intent but may not align with natural representations.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the tree's bark and leaves consistent with natural materials, showing no signs of digital over-enhancement such as repeating patterns or unnatural gloss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's bark and leaves appear smooth and simplified, lacking the intricate textures one would expect from real bark and foliage. Given the framed and crafted nature of this scene, these elements are likely designed to mimic a stylized art piece rather than replicate natural textures, which commonly accompanies art forms like painted dioramas.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the flower patches beneath the tree uniformly distributed and blended into the existing meadow, without visible cloning artifacts, sharp edges, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower patches are placed within an art piece, showing intentional distribution fitting a composition rather than a natural blend. The flowers appear to be evenly and artistically arranged without sharp edges or inconsistencies that would suggest automatic digital manipulation, consistent with intentional artistic craft.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the tree seamlessly blended, with no visible layering lines, color jumps, or flat regions that break the illusion of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is part of a shadow box or diorama structure, meaning that the depth is stylistically represented. No visible seams or interruptions break the intended illusion of a crafted depth, which is fitting for the design of the art piece while not seeking to represent an actual landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cloud figures positioned above the scene on thin, non-visible wires, appearing small and light enough to suggest suspension, without overlapping or intersecting with the tree or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are clearly attached to thin wires as part of the display, positioned above the scene in a crafted style. They do not overlap with the tree or ground, adhering to the aesthetic rules of such artistic presentations, ensuring a sense of suspension.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame clearly visible around the scene with consistent material appearance, straight edges, and proper shadowing that indicates a three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden frame is plainly visible and exhibits consistent material qualities with straight edges and shadowing that uphold the three-dimensional appearance typical of shadow boxes or diorama art, successfully portraying its structure.",
