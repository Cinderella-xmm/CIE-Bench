    "Question": "Q1: Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock are designed to resemble horns, a characteristic feature commonly associated with dragons. These spikes are visually aligned to be symmetrical with respect to the guitar neck, without any obvious signs of clipping or distortion. The angles at which these are placed are consistent with the structure of the headstock, contributing to a coherent dragon motif. This understanding is based on the visual examination of the headstock and its alignment with the instrument's neck, combining it with the common design elements of dragons.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fretboard of the guitar is embellished with luminescent runes, a detail that adds an element of fantasy and magic, commonly associated with dragon lore. These runes are clearly visible, maintaining their form within the boundaries of the fretboard itself, without bleeding into the wood. They appear as part of the fretboard rather than floating overlays, which suggests a seamless integration into the design. This is inferred by analyzing how the runes maintain consistent visibility and position along the fretboard.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fiery tendrils are designed to represent flames—a thematic element often related to dragons. These tendrils appear to start at the bridge of the guitar and continue upward toward the nut in a continuous, uninterrupted manner. There are no visible gaps or floating segments in the flames, suggesting they are part of a cohesive design element that overlays the guitar, following a natural path consistent with how fire might realistically spread. This conclusion is drawn by observing the continuity and fluidity of the flame design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar is depicted with dragon wings extending from its sides, a feature meant to enhance the dragon motif. These wings are visually symmetrical in relation to the guitar's body, which is a typical design choice for balance and aesthetic harmony. The scales on the wings are evenly spaced, contributing to a realistic, textured appearance without noticeable gaps or distortions. This assessment is based on the pattern uniformity and symmetry of the wings around the body of the guitar.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the guitar maintains a classic silhouette of a Gibson SG. In Image B, despite additions like dragon scales or ridges, the body preserves this original shape, which is vital for visual recognition as a guitar. The dragon-like textures—such as scales—are applied consistently across the body without breaking its contour or creating visible seams. This consistent texturing and maintenance of contour detail ensure that the guitar remains recognizable while adopting a fantastical appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
