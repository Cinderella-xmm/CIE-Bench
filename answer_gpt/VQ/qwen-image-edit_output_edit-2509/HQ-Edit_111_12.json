      "question": "Are the enlarged knitting needles proportionally consistent with the size of the woman's hands and aligned naturally with her fingers without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles are significantly larger compared to the usual size seen with typical knitting setups. They appear to not align naturally with the woman's fingers, which would typically grasp needles in a way that appears balanced and aligned with the knitting action. Instead, the exaggerated size causes a visual mismatch with the positioning and holding of the hands. Consequently, the needles appear somewhat awkward, suggesting an intentional stylization rather than practical use.",

      "question": "Do the steam lines above the teacup rise smoothly from the rim in a continuous, curved pattern without sharp breaks or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam lines from the teacup are drawn with a smooth, continuous, and curved pattern that rises naturally from the rim. The depiction does not include any sharp breaks or awkward angles that would disrupt the natural flow of steam, thus maintaining a realistic representation of steam movement.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed yarn pattern on the fabric retain consistent knit stitches and natural thread flow without visible pixelation or irregular textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B renders the yarn pattern in a simplified, artistic manner that emphasizes larger areas of color and shape rather than detailed knit stitches. This stylization deviates from the realistic texture and consistency of individual stitches, leading to a less detailed appearance and more abstract representation of knitting. Consequently, the lack of precise knit stitches results in a discontinuity of natural thread flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the writing panel positioned within the open book pages such that its edges align naturally with the page boundaries and the knitted border matches the texture and color of the surrounding fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the writing panel appears as an overlay on the open book page, with its placement somewhat misaligned concerning the page's boundaries. The knitted border intended to enclose the panel does not match the typical page texture and color, exhibiting a stark contrast with the book's overall presentation. The alignment and border differences suggest an added element that diverges from natural integration.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the added lamplight effect produce a gradual glow around the book and cup without creating unnatural bright spots or conflicting shadows on the armchair or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamplight effect is applied to create a cozy atmosphere around the book and cup; however, the glow emanates in a way that results in some overly bright spots. These spots do not have a smooth gradient and contradict the natural lighting that would create softer transitions and shadows. The result is an unrealistic light effect that clashes with other elements in the scene.",
