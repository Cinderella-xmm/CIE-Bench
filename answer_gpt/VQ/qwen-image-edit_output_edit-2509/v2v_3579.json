    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces forming the human figure in Image B are arranged neatly and connect seamlessly to create the overall structure of a human figure. There are no apparent breaks or misalignments that disrupt the coherence of the structure, allowing the figure to maintain a natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces used to form the human figure display colors like salmon pink, avocado green, and white rice, which are consistent with the sushi map colors from Image A. There are no signs of unusual or unnatural color variants present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces in Image B that form the human figure possess well-defined edges and clear outlines. The image does not show any signs of blurred or pixelated artifacts that would otherwise disrupt the clarity of the figure's composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces used to form the human figure in Image B appear proportionate compared to similar pieces in Image A. The form of each piece, whether roll-sized or sashimi-sized, remains realistic without any extreme scaling or distortion that could compromise their natural look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces in the lifted arm of the human figure in Image B are positioned to mimic a natural human pose with raised arm. The arrangement suggests a plausible arm posture without odd bends or angles that could suggest an anatomical inconsistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
