      "question": "Does the chibi character maintain proper structural consistency, with the head being slightly oversized yet naturally proportioned to the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters are typically characterized by an oversized head relative to a smaller body, which creates a cute and appealing visual style. In Image B, the chibi character's head is indeed larger than the body, consistent with the art style, and does not appear awkward or disproportionate. The head and body are well-integrated, maintaining the structural consistency typical of chibi design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gray T-shirt and shorts of the chibi character accurately and naturally represented, without introducing any unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's gray T-shirt and shorts are smoothly colored and uniform, maintaining a consistent texture that aligns well within the cartoon style. There are no noticeable texture anomalies or color inconsistencies that would disrupt the visual cohesiveness or introduce an unnatural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cartoonified skateboard retain its visual plausibility with no unnatural textures or loss of fine details that would disrupt the scene’s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skateboard in Image B is rendered in a simplified cartoon style similar to the chibi character. Its shape and outline are clear, and the wheels are distinct, maintaining visual plausibility. There are no evident disruptions in texture or missing details that would adversely affect its authenticity within the cartoon scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the new hand-drawn city skyline background coherent and visually plausible, contributing positively to the overall scene without disrupting the main character’s prominence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The city skyline background in Image B is drawn in a minimalistic, hand-drawn style, complementing the chibi character. The simple lines and shapes do not interfere with or overpower the character; instead, they provide an effective backdrop, enhancing the composition rather than disrupting it. The skyline serves to situate the character in a plausible environment while maintaining focus on the main figure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image exhibit overall authenticity and natural appearance, with no obvious artifacts or distortions introduced during the stylization process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B successfully employs a stylized cartoon approach, with each element—chibi character, skateboard, and skyline—contributing harmoniously to the scene. This cohesiveness suggests that the entire image is free from artifacts or distortions that would detract from its intended aesthetic. The transition from realistic to cartoon styling appears seamless, preserving authenticity in the context of the chosen art style.",
