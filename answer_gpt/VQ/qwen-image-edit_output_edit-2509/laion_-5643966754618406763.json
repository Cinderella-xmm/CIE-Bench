    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the concept is steampunk-inspired, with the turtle having a shell that resembles armored segments. The tread patterns of the tires have been intricately incorporated into the wheels of the turtle creature, maintaining their detailed texture. There is no indication of texture repetition or detail loss, the patterns appear consistent and clear. The design integrates the tough, rugged look of tire treads into a seamless armored aesthetic for the turtle’s appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels connected to the turtle have metallic elements. These joints appear to fit well within the wheel openings, connecting smoothly with no visible gaps or deformations. This suggests that the edited image maintains a uniform and well-constructed look, keeping the mechanical elements in harmony with their intended placements. Thus, there is appropriate alignment and connection evident in the edited design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The turtle's eyes are designed to be glowing mechanical features in Image B, similar to a robotic enhancement. The blue glow is centralized within the eye socket, showing consistent emission of light that does not appear pixelated. Additionally, there is no excessive or unnatural light spillage onto adjacent surfaces, indicating that the brightness is controlled and integrated well into the visual structure of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antennae in Image B are not attached to a tire stack; instead, they are on the turtle’s shell. The positioning on the shell is smooth, and there are no visible disconnected or floating segments. The antennas are seamlessly part of the robotic aspect, fitting the creature design.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of tires into the body structure of a turtle has been executed in creating a unified creature shape. The elements of the turtle, including the shell and wheels, are proportionally balanced and show continuity without missing or duplicated parts. The scaling appears correct, contributing to a cohesive design that aligns well with the mechanical, steampunk aesthetic seen in the image.",
