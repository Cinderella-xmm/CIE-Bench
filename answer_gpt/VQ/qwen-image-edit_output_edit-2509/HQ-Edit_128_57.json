      "question": "Does the desk exhibit continuous, realistic embossed wood textures across its surface without visible seams, irregularities, or artificial-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the desk appears to have a smooth surface with intricate wood textures that are consistent, suggesting a realistic and uninterrupted embossed design. The scrollwork and wood grains display craftsmanship akin to high-quality woodwork commonly seen in luxury furniture, with no visible seams or irregularities that would indicate artificial patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the writing pad positioned flatly on the desk with uniform edges and natural aging effects such as slight discoloration and texture variation, without warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The writing pad in Image B is positioned upright within handcrafted woodwork rather than lying flat on a desk. However, its edges are uniform and the texture shows slight variations, indicative of the natural aging that accords with quality paper. Though the orientation differs from a typical desk setting, it maintains a coherent style without warped geometry, aligning with craftsmanship norms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the quill-shaped logo rendered with a raised, metallic gold finish that shows subtle highlights and shadows consistent with embossed foil, without smearing or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill-shaped logo on the writing pad exhibits a gold finish that resembles metallic embossing. The highlights and shadows are subtle and reflect consistent detailing that suggests a metal-like sheen without smearing, matching embossed foil characteristics often seen in luxury stationery designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ink bottle placed stably on the desk surface with proportional size and shape consistent with real glass bottles, and does the spine of the pad show clear, readable etched text without blurring or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ink bottle in Image B appears proportional and stable as per common observations of glass bottles. However, it is placed on top of a box and not directly on a desk surface. The text on the spine of the pad is visible and defined, indicating clear etching without any blurring or ghosting, aligning with expectations for printed text on leather or similar materials.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all modified elements (desk, pad, quill logo, ink bottle) proportionally aligned and spatially coherent, forming a unified vintage stationery package layout without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, each element—the desk-like structure, the writing pad within it, the quill logo, and the ink bottle—are proportionally aligned. They create a cohesive overall composition that visually represents a unified stationery package, typical in a vintage aesthetic. The elements do not appear floating or misaligned, maintaining a coherent spatial arrangement.",
