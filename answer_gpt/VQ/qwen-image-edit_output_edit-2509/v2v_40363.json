      "question": "Does the heart balloon retain its geometric shape without any broken lines or unnatural textures in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart balloon is depicted in a mosaic style with clear geometric segmentation due to the mosaic tiles. Despite these segmentation lines, the overall geometric shape of the heart is maintained without any distortion or broken lines. This observation suggests a careful preservation of the original shape, even within the constraints of the mosaic design, which would typically require the adaptation of shapes into sometimes angular or segmented forms.",

      "question": "Are the child's facial features and hair preserved with clear outlines and no distortion in the mosaic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic transformation affects the representation of facial features and hair by introducing mosaic tiles that segment the area. The outlines of the hair appear altered due to the mosaic style, which brings more emphasis on the tile boundaries rather than fine details. The facial features are obscured, reinforcing that clear outlines are not maintained. The mosaic style inherently transforms smooth outlines into segmented forms, which may not capture finer details accurately, leading to a loss of clarity in these areas.",

      "question": "Is the background transformed into a mosaic style without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the blue and yellow color harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been transformed into a mosaic style with a consistent application of blue and yellow tiles. The mosaic transformation does not introduce artifacts that distract or disrupt the color harmony which is an essential part of the original design. The color distribution is even, and both colors retain their vibrancy, ensuring that the harmony between the blue and yellow colors is preserved, characteristic of well-integrated mosaic art.",

      "question": "Does the red balloon maintain its vibrant color and round shape without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red balloon in Image B maintains its vibrant color, with the hue remaining consistent and bold. The round shape, while segmented into mosaic tiles, still reflects a coherent circular form. The mosaic tiles can typically introduce a fragmented look, but in this case, the balloonâ€™s texture and shape appear well-preserved, retaining the intended vibrant and smooth appearance consistent with the original art's intent.",

      "question": "Does the child's hand retain a natural appearance with no more than five fingers and no distortion in the mosaic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B, while it undergoes a mosaic transformation, retains a natural appearance with no more than five fingers visible. The hand's shape and gesture appear consistent with natural anatomical proportions; the mosaic tiling does not introduce distortion that alters the recognizability or natural form of the hand. The tiles fitting the original contours uphold a realistic depiction within the stylistic constraints of mosaic art.",
