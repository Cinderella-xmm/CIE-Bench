      "question": "Are the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel evenly spaced, angularly consistent, and free from jagged edges or irregularities that suggest distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chevron pattern on the bag is consistently represented. The lines forming the pattern appear evenly spaced and maintain an angular consistency without any visible jagged edges or distortions. This is deduced from the symmetrical and regular appearance of the lines relative to each other, indicating that they are well-rendered. Comparing this with Image A, where the pattern is physically on the bag, the digital rendering in Image B respects this geometrical uniformity.",

      "question": "Do the gold zippers retain their linear definition and proper placement along the seams, with no misalignment or broken segments suggesting artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold zippers on the illustration maintain a clear and well-defined linearity. They are properly placed along the seams, which matches the structure seen in Image A where the zippers are intact and correctly positioned. There are no visible signs of misalignment or broken segments in the illustration, indicating good digital representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the olive tone applied uniformly across the surface of the bag, with no patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation that suggests digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The olive tone on the bag in Image B appears evenly distributed across the surface. In examining this digital representation, the color is consistent and there are no visible patches or areas where saturation drops significantly, indicating well-applied coloration. In contrast, Image A shows a physical bag where you can observe certain textures and shadows influencing the hue, but Image B simplifies this into a flat, uniform color as expected in an illustration.",

      "question": "Is the blank message area on the back of the postcard aligned with the dimensions of the front design, with straight edges and no visible warping or layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard features a blank message area with clearly defined, straight edges that remain consistent with the front design's dimensions. The layout and alignment appear precise without any signs of warping or misalignment errors, which suggests careful attention to maintaining the structure within the digital frame.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the black portfolio contain the postcard with proper depth and alignment, showing no clipping, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the postcard neatly framed within the black portfolio. Examining the shadows and alignment, there are no clipping issues or unnatural gaps that indicate a mismatch in depth or alignment between the postcard and the portfolio. The layout looks convincingly three-dimensional and correctly integrated.",
