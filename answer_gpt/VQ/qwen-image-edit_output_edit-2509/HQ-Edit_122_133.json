      "question": "Do the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay have proportionally correct limbs and body structures that maintain anatomical plausibility without visible deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are depicted as anthropomorphic figures dressed in Victorian attire. Their limbs and body structures are proportionate to typical human anatomy, considering their upright posture and joint placement akin to human limbs. The visual cues show no visible deformities or disproportions that would make the anatomy implausible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay rendered with clear, consistent texture and stitching, free from pixelation, blurring, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Victorian garments in Image B are detailed with visible texture and stitching, reflecting consistency and clarity in the textile patterns and ornamental designs. There's an absence of pixelation or blurring, indicating a high-quality rendering of the fabrics and embellishments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the miniature stage and alcove elements positioned with proper depth and alignment, and do icicles and pine accents adhere to gravitational and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stage and alcove with elements like icicles and pine elements. These are positioned logically, adhering to gravity; icicles hanging downward and pine trees standing erect. The spatial arrangement respects a foreground-background alignment, indicating proper depth manipulation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all miniature seasonal elements (e.g., ornaments, snowflakes) properly scaled, cast realistic shadows, and aligned with the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seasonal elements in Image B are scaled appropriately relative to the scene, with each casting shadows consistent with the lighting direction from the top. The shadows align correctly with the light source, reinforcing the realism of the sceneâ€™s lighting and shadow dynamics.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the split-frame border clean and seamless, with no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding at the boundary between the two scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a split-frame border as it is entirely different from the first image. Therefore, no assessment of a border can be made regarding artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding in Image B.",
