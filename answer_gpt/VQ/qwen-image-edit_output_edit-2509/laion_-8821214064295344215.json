      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiles on the teddy bears' sweaters are arranged to define the contours and shapes accurately by using the yellow and turquoise colors.

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the teddy bears are distinct and clearly demarcated using different colored and shaded tiles. The eyes, nose, and mouth are all well-proportioned and correctly placed on the face, making them recognizable without any misalignment or blurring. This suggests a careful and precise arrangement of the tiles to maintain facial detail.",

      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows on the teddy bears' necks are made using a different style compared to the mosaic tiles on the rest of the teddy bears. They have smooth, reflective surfaces, which visually contrasts with the textured, mosaic-tiled fur, thereby retaining their original shape and purpose as ornamental accessories.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white pedestal on which the teddy bears sit appears to be seamlessly integrated with the base.
