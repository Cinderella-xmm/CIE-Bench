      "question": "Is the treasure chest still geometrically intact and proportionally consistent with its original form when placed on the newly added weathered map background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest retains its original structure and dimensions as seen in Image A. The chest is depicted with the same metal bands, rivets, and wood texture as before. Though it is now placed on a map background, it maintains its geometric integrity, showing no signs of distortion or disproportionate scaling. Comparing the dimensions and alignment of the chest in both images shows that it remains unchanged in geometry and proportional consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ropes used as decorative borders maintain their natural fiber texture and realistic coil shapes without appearing stretched, flattened, or unnaturally contorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ropes decorating the borders are depicted with a texture that resembles natural fiber, and their coil shapes appear realistic. The ropes do not show any signs of stretching, flattening, or unnatural contortion; they follow smooth curves and consistent thickness, mimicking how ropes naturally behave. This maintains authenticity in their appearance and keeps them aligned with the theme of the sea and treasure.",

      "question": "Are the symbols and ancient-style text in the legend aligned properly with the overall lighting and depth of the image, and do they appear cleanly rendered without jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legend in Image B, consisting of symbols and text, is harmoniously integrated with the overall design. These elements possess clean lines and clear rendering. The text style and symbols align with the historical theme without any jagged edges or color bleeding. The lighting and depth effects that apply to the rest of the image are also coherent with these textual elements, ensuring consistency and clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the compass rose in the bottom-right corner have consistent metallic sheen and shadowing that aligns with the lighting direction and material properties of the surrounding gold coins and gems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose in Image B is designed with a metallic sheen that suggests a polished surface, similar to the surrounding gold coins and gems. Its shadowing and reflections are consistent with the overall lighting direction seen in the map background. The highlights and shading on the compass surface mirror that of the treasure-related items, reinforcing a cohesive visual style emphasizing material properties.",

      "question": "Are the sea monster motifs seamlessly blended into the map background, maintaining consistent line thickness and shading with the rest of the ink drawings, and do they not appear as disjointed or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea monster motifs in Image B are integrated seamlessly into the map background through consistent line thickness and shading. They fit well with the rest of the ink drawings on the map, showing no signs of being disjointed or misplaced. The motifs appear naturally stylized in line with traditional map illustrations, contributing to the vintage theme of the overall design.",
