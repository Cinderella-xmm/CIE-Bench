    "Question": "Q1: Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's head appears large in comparison to its body, but this depiction does not cause visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area. The styling is typical for cartoonish representations where the head is exaggerated while maintaining proportions that avoid distortion. This style can often be seen in caricatures and animations, where large heads are used for comedic effect.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not feature green sunglasses, but rather red sunglasses. The sunglasses are consistently rendered, maintaining a glossy reflection typical for plastic lenses. They do not exhibit unnatural edges or texture breaks, as the design follows a stylized cartoon fashion where elements are simplified and accentuated.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pig depicted has three fingers on each hand, consistent with cartoon designs where fewer digits are often used for simplicity and stylistic effect. Typical animal anatomy for pigs lacks fingers altogether, but for the cartoon style, anatomical accuracy is secondary to design choice, which in this case uses three stylized fingers.",
