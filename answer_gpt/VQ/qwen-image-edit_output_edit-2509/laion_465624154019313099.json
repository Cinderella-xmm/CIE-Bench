      "question": "Are the eyes added to the cake positioned naturally on the surface without distorting the shape or texture of the meringue domes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes have been added to the cake in a cartoon style. The positioning does not adhere naturally to the contours or texture of the meringue domes, as they are placed prominently without consideration for the cake's original surface characteristics. This is typical in cartoon illustrations where stylization overrides realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the strawberries have been illustrated as a hat on top of the cake character. The strawberries appear consistent in shape and size, similar to real strawberries. The cartoon format allows for some abstraction, but the overall representation is faithful without apparent warping or stretching.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faint silhouettes of utensils in the background visually consistent with the lighting and depth of the scene, without introducing harsh edges or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a cartoon style scene with faint silhouettes of utensils in the backdrop. The silhouettes have been designed to fit the cartoon aesthetic, but they might not align perfectly with realistic lighting and depth. However, within the context of the scene and its stylized nature, they don't introduce harsh edges or overly unnatural shadows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the strawberries and garnishes arranged around the cake in a way that maintains structural balance and does not overlap or distort the cake’s base or side layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The strawberries and garnishes in Image B are arranged around the illustrated cake character. The cartoon doesn't reflect realistic balance, as the focus is more on aesthetic appeal and humor rather than accurate structural representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cake shaking its head in the cartoon suggests movement that does not preserve the rigidity typical of a real cake's structure. The layers are flexing as part of the illustration’s narrative and context, which is a common characteristic in animated scenes.",
