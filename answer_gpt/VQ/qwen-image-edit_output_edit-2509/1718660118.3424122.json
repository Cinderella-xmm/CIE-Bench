    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the brass and copper elements on the uniform show natural surface variations, such as subtle scratches, patina, and reflective highlights, without appearing uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass and copper elements on the uniform exhibit texture and varied highlights, suggesting the presence of natural surface variations like subtle scratches and patina. This appearance is consistent with real-life materials that have been exposed to wear and the environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gear components on the uniform properly embedded within the fabric structure, maintaining consistent depth and avoiding overlapping or misaligned teeth that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gear components on the steampunk-style uniform in Image B appear to be appropriately embedded within the fabric, without misalignment or overlapping that would disrupt geometric continuity. The depth and arrangement of the gears are consistent with realistic mechanical integration into clothing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mechanical throne have visible support structures and grounding that prevent it from appearing suspended or unstable, with all cogwheels and braces attached logically to the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The throne in Image B displays visible support structures and grounding elements which provide stability and a logical attachment for all cogwheels and braces. This creates an impression of a solid, well-engineered structure that aligns with mechanical design principles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the copper, brown, and dark green hues distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background, with transitions between colors following natural lighting gradients and avoiding abrupt or patchy changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors—copper, brown, and dark green—are distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background. The transitions between these colors follow natural lighting gradients, enhancing the overall aesthetic continuity and avoiding patchy or abrupt color changes.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the steam trails in the background have gradual opacity and wispy edges, flowing naturally from potential sources like vents or machinery, without sharp outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam trails in the background of Image B have wispy edges and gradual changes in opacity, flowing naturally from vents or machinery. This depiction avoids harsh outlines and pixelation, providing a realistic representation of steam behavior.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands display five fingers with proper spacing and curvature, and are the knuckles and fingernails rendered with natural detail, without any fused, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both hands in Image B are shown with five fingers each, having appropriate spacing and curvature. The knuckles and fingernails are depicted with natural detail, and there are no fused, missing, or duplicated digits evident.",
