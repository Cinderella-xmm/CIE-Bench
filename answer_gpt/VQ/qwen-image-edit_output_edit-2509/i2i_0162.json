      "question": "Does the mouse's fur texture appear smooth and maintain the natural look expected in a Pixar-style animation without unnatural or overly simplified patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture of the mouse appears smooth and consistent with the aesthetic that one would expect from a Pixar-style animation. This style often features a fine balance between realism and artistic smoothness, ensuring the character maintains a lively, appealing look without appearing too simplified. The fur's color gradient and smooth transitions are characteristic of Pixar's visual style, which strives for visually pleasing textures while avoiding overly simple patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers proportionally correct and not distorted relative to its body size in the Pixar animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers are exaggerated in size, which is consistent with Pixar's animation style where such features are often accentuated to increase expressiveness and cuteness. The proportions are deliberately larger relative to the body size, creating a whimsical and charming appearance without appearing distorted. This enlarged proportion is typical in animations to evoke emotional responses and maintain a distinctly animated style.",

      "question": "Do the soft shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs appear naturally integrated into the scene without any harsh or misplaced artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows beneath the mouse and around the crumbs are soft and consistent with the lighting setup observed in the scene. Shadows in Pixar's style are typically subtle, helping to ground characters and objects within the environment naturally. They are integrated well, avoiding any sharp edges or displaced artifacts that would break the illusion created by the animated style.",

      "question": "Does the floor's texture retain sufficient detail and pattern authenticity in the Pixar animation style, avoiding unnatural smoothing or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floor's texture retains detail and authenticity consistent with Pixar animation style. The floor maintains discernible patterns and a level of texture that makes it believable within an animated context. Pixar typically balances realism with simplicity, ensuring that backgrounds complement the characters without being overly smooth or artificial, which is achieved here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crumbs' sizes and shapes consistent and believable within the context of the image, without displaying any unnatural irregularities or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crumbs are varied in size and shape but maintain a consistency that fits with the animated style. While animated styles allow for some exaggeration, the crumbs here are believable and complement the scene without appearing distorted. Their distribution and proportions are logical, contributing to the scene's believability.",
