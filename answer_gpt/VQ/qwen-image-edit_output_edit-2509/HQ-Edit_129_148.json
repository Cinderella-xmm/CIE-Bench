      "question": "Is the figure proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe such that her body parts (especially limbs and head) maintain natural anatomical alignment and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure within the globe appears to maintain a natural anatomical alignment, where the proportions of the body parts such as arms and head look consistently scaled without any visible distortion. The figure is centrally positioned on the base of the globe, enhancing the natural appearance and balance.",

      "question": "Are the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle clearly visible and free from blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail after conversion to a 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the intricate patterns on the dress, which include vibrant colors and geometric designs, are distinctly visible and maintain their sharpness without blurring or aliasing. Similarly, the braided hairstyle is displayed with clear detail, indicating a successful conversion to a 3D model without losing fine details.",

      "question": "Do the wall patterns inside the globe accurately reflect the colors and shapes of the dress's pattern without warping, misalignment, or color deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall patterns inside the globe in Image B feature colors and shapes consistent with the dress's pattern. The patterns are replicated in a manner that avoids warping or misalignment, and the colors remain true to the original, indicating careful attention to design and color accuracy.",

      "question": "Are the miniature roots beneath the figure arranged in a way that follows natural growth patterns and does not intersect or distort the figureâ€™s legs or skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature roots beneath the figure are arranged to mimic natural growth, sprawling outward without intersecting or distorting the figure's legs or skirt. The arrangement of the roots adds to the visual harmony and avoids any unnatural alignment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature animals appear to be positioned appropriately at ground level with shadows that provide a sense of depth. Their scale is consistent concerning the figure, and their forms exhibit natural textures without visible artifacts, suggesting a high level of detail in the depiction.",
