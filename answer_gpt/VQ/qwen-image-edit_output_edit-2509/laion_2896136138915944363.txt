    "Question": "Q1: Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration shows the bird in a natural posture, akin to standing. The wings appear aligned with the torso, and the legs are symmetrically placed beneath the body, supporting the bird's upright stance without any distortion or unnatural angles. Comparing this to Image A, the bird maintains the same proportions and posture, consistent with a real sandpiper's appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures on the packaging surface uniform in pattern and color, with no repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions between areas?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the packaging with a consistent wave pattern across the surface. The colors and design appear unified, without evidence of repeating tiles or sharp edges that might disrupt the visual flow. The transition between different areas on the packaging is smooth and natural.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' fully visible, correctly aligned, and rendered with smooth edges without jagged lines or transparency artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' in Image B is clearly visible, centered on the packaging, and displays smooth edges without any jagged lines or transparency issues. It has a professional appearance and is easy to read, indicating proper text rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns on the bottom of the packaging form smooth, continuous curves that flow seamlessly. There are no gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions that disrupt the aesthetic of the wave pattern, contributing to a cohesive design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Is the binocular-shaped cut-out window properly shaped with smooth contours, and does it show a clear, non-distorted view of internal kit components without floating or misplaced objects?",
    "explanation": "The cut-out window is shaped like binoculars and has smooth, well-defined contours. Inside the window, the binocular kit components are visible, appearing non-distorted, with no signs of floating or misplacement. The view is clear and as expected for such packaging.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is there a smooth, continuous transition between the sandpiper illustration and the surrounding packaging elements, with no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration blends smoothly with the surrounding packaging design elements. There are no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities that separate the bird illustration from the design, ensuring a cohesive integration into the overall packaging aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
