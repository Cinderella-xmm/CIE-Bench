      "question": "Do the edges and contours of the stapler maintain their smoothness without any jagged or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the contours and edges of the stapler are smooth and consistent in both the front and back views. There are no irregularities or sharp breaks that would detract from the visual integrity of the stapler. This smoothness is indicative of careful rendering or editing, ensuring that the object appears well-defined and aesthetically pleasing across both perspectives.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color and metallic finish of the stapler consistent across both the front and back views with no visible texture discrepancies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue color of the stapler is uniform across both views and there is no visible inconsistency in the shading or texture of the paint. The metallic components, such as the staple area and screws, also maintain consistency without any artifacts or discrepancies that would indicate texture or finish issues. This uniformity helps in maintaining a cohesive appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical components such as screws and hinges depicted accurately and consistently between the two views, avoiding any illogical positioning or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical components in Image B, like the screws and hinge area, appear logical and consistent between the front and back views. The position and depiction of these elements do not exhibit distortion or illogical positioning, which implies that the representation of mechanical details is both accurate and reliable.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the stapler match the lighting conditions in both views, ensuring a believable three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases appropriate use of shadows and highlights, consistent with a singular light source suggested by the reflections and shadows cast in both views. This consistency contributes to a believable three-dimensional effect, emphasizing the volumetric aspects of the stapler under the same lighting scenario across both the front and back views.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the layout of the stapler's side-by-side views clear and uncluttered, with no distracting or misplaced elements disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side-by-side layout of the stapler views is well-organized. There are no extraneous elements or clutter disrupting the visual composition, allowing for easy comparison and examination of both perspectives. The clean layout helps in maintaining focus on the stapler itself without visual noise or disruption.",
