    "Question": "Q1: Do the LEGO blocks forming the bookshelf and books have a uniform, smooth plastic texture throughout, with no residual wood grain or mixed material appearances?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf and books are constructed from LEGO bricks, which are known for their smooth and uniform plastic texture. There are no visible residual wood grain patterns or indications of mixed materials that are typically inconsistent with standard LEGO construction. This suggests that the texture is consistent with what one would expect from LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the colors of the LEGO blocks uniformly earthy-toned (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) and consistent with the original bookshelfâ€™s color scheme, without any unexpected or jarring color deviations?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a LEGO booktower constructed with bricks in earthy tones such as browns and tans, mirroring the color palette of the original wooden bookshelf in Image A. The consistency in earthy tones ensures that there are no unexpected or jarring color deviations that would contrast with the original design theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the darker LEGO bricks used for carvings clearly aligned and shaped to replicate the original decorative patterns on the spines and shelf edges without blurring or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while LEGO blocks are used to approximate the patterns found in the original bookshelf, the nature of LEGO construction results in block-like, simplified shapes without intricate detail or alignment errors. LEGO lacks the capability to replicate fine carving patterns, thus there may be noticeable differences when compared with intricate decorations in Image A.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the top of the LEGO tower taper smoothly and symmetrically from the base upward, without jagged edges, irregular steps, or disproportionate narrowing?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO structure in Image B has a design where the top tapers in a stepwise manner, typical of LEGO constructions where smooth transitions are difficult to achieve due to the nature of the block shapes. Despite this, the taper is symmetrical and consistent, aligning with the expected geometric constraints.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background behind the LEGO tower completely plain and muted, with no traces of the original textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a plain, muted background without any visible texture or artifacts that might suggest the presence of the original wallpaper. The background serves to provide a clear contrast to the LEGO tower, ensuring it stands out without distractions from the original setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all LEGO blocks aligned perfectly in rows and columns, with no gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that disrupt the modular structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks maintain a modular structure, forming a coherent tower where bricks appear to be aligned properly without gaps or misalignments. LEGO's design ensures a uniform assembly where blocks fit seamlessly unless explicitly manipulated otherwise.",
    "answer": "Yes"
