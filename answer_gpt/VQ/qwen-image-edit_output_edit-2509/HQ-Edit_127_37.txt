    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight's armor appears to be uniformly metallic with a sheen that is consistent across various parts. This observation is based on the way the light reflects off the armor, indicating a smooth, metallic surface without warping or overly smooth textures that seem unnatural. Such visual cues are characteristic of metallic surfaces in art depictions, which maintain a uniform texture to reflect light effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is depicted with clear, well-defined edges and displays realistic light refraction, demonstrated by the minor distortions visible through the glass. The dome successfully encloses all internal elements without them intersecting or breaking through the enclosed space, suggesting careful attention to spatial coherence in the artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
    "explanation": "The shield in Image B exhibits an embossed lion design, which is visible upon inspection. The metallic sheen of the shield suggests a consistent texture that maintains fine details, preventing any flatness that would detract from the shield’s three-dimensional appearance. This is demonstrated by the shadows and highlights present, which contribute to the perception of depth.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep surrounding the chibi knight are proportionately smaller, aligning with artistic conventions where background elements are typically portrayed smaller to emphasize the main subject. Their wooly texture appears natural, with a fluffy, uneven surface consistent with real sheep. Additionally, they are positioned firmly on the ground, with no indication of floating or cutting through other objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the dragon’s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
    "explanation": "The dragon in Image B is depicted curled around the castle turret, forming a continuous curve without intersecting or cutting through the structure. Its body displays a scaly texture that is uniformly applied, indicating consistency in the artistic representation. This attention to detail in the scales and body curvature enhances the natural look of the dragon, without visible gaps or signs of structural deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
