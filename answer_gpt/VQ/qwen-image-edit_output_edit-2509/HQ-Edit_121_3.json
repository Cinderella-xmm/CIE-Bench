      "question": "Do the transformed wings retain smooth, continuous petal shapes that follow natural curvature and avoid jagged or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the butterfly have been transformed into a design composed of overlapping petals. These petals exhibit smooth and continuous edges, which follow a natural curvature typical of real flower petals. There are no visible jagged or fragmented edges, which suggests that the transformation was done with attention to maintaining an organic look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaf designs on the wings detailed, evenly distributed, and free from unnatural pixelation or repeating patterns that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wing designs in Image B include leaf motifs that are evenly distributed across the wings. Upon inspection, these leaf designs are detailed and show a natural variety in pattern, avoiding the appearance of digital artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural repetition. This indicates that the design was rendered with quality and realism in mind.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tendrils extending from the antennae curve smoothly and taper gradually, resembling natural plant growth rather than sharp, mechanical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the antennae have been transformed into tendril-like structures that exhibit a gentle and natural curvature. They gradually taper off instead of ending abruptly or displaying mechanical, straight lines. This design choice closely mimics the appearance of plant tendrils, which typically grow in smooth, flowing curves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small blossoms at the wing edges and foot similar in color, texture, and size to the surrounding flowers in the meadow, and do they attach seamlessly without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small blossoms incorporated into the wing edges and foot align well in color, texture, and size with the surrounding meadow flowers. They blend harmoniously into the scene, attaching seamlessly to the wings without appearing to float independently or have clipping issues, which could detract from the natural appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterflyâ€™s body transformed into a straight, slender stalk that connects naturally to the head and base, with no visible breaks or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation in Image B shows the butterfly's body turned into a slender stalk that is straight and well-aligned. It connects smoothly to the head and the base, without any visible breaks or misalignments. This continuous form helps maintain the illusion of the butterfly being an integral part of the floral design it features.",
