    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals are depicted with jagged crystal facets, maintaining the natural curvature seen in the original lily petals. There is no visible warping or geometric breaks in the petal shapes. Crystal petals often provide a faceted appearance, similar to how light interacts with facets on a crystal surface, allowing them to preserve the original shape while adding an enhanced texture. In Image A, the petals have smooth edges typical of natural flowers, which aligns with what is seen converted in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows glass rods that extend naturally from the vase to match the stems of the original flowers. There are no visible signs of disconnection or misalignment. This indicates a careful preservation and translation of the original alignment seen in Image A, where the stems are bundled in a natural arrangement within the vase.",

      "question": "Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black marble surface in Image B is depicted as smooth and uniformly dark. It exhibits reflections, as can be expected from a polished marble surface, with shadows and highlights that suggest the presence of a light source above, consistent with object placement and the natural appearance of reflective surfaces. In Image A, no surface is present, but Image B derives this effect by utilizing common attributes of polished marble.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows crystal petals with subtle variations in amber hue and transparency. The internal light refractions and depth cues contribute to a perception of volume and translucency, which are characteristic of glass or crystal objects. This is a transformation from Image A, where the petals are solid in color, reflecting a realistic adaptation in the edited image.",

      "question": "Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass rods appear to enter the water at angles aligned with refraction principles, showing slight bending at the waterline, consistent with how light refracts through water and glass. The rods remain submerged, not floating or disappearing mid-length, replicating the view of stems in water in Image A, adjusted for the properties specific to transparent materials.",
