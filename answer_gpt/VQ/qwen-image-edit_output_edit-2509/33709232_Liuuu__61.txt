    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been transformed into a futuristic, armored structure. The armor has a sleek, geometric design with defined panels, indicating consistent proportions. There are no visible warping or broken edges along its surface, suggesting a well-implemented transformation without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building features stylized shoulder pads on its structure. The integration seems smooth, with uniform patterns and clean, sharp edges. There are no signs of stretching or fragmentation, indicating a high-quality integration into the existing architecture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the traffic signs are replaced with holographic displays that exhibit a soft glow and transparency, typical of holograms. These effects appear contained within the signs and do not cause any visible light leaks or unintended color alterations in the nearby surroundings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "The robots in Image B exhibit limbs that appear proportionate, with joints and shapes following a logical geometric structure. Upon closer inspection, the hands feature five fingers, consistent with human anatomy. There are no noticeable issues like unnatural bending or segments missing from the robotic figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by both the robotic pedestrians and the building are in alignment with the apparent sunlight direction coming from the top-left. These shadows fall naturally on the ground plane and align with the shadow positions of the unaltered environment, maintaining visual consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
