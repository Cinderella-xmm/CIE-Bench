    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the snow-capped peak exhibit a consistent, non-uniform glittering texture that mimics natural snow while avoiding blocky or artificial sparkles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-capped peak has a texture that appears to mimic the natural granularity and sparkle of snow, capturing light and shadow realistically. There are no signs of digital artifacts like blocky or pixelated textures, which suggests a carefully executed rendering. This mimics a natural snow effect effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree lines and grasslands along the base of the mountain rendered with natural variation in color and density, without repeating brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree lines and grasslands in Image B show a variation in color and density, which helps create a realistic appearance of a natural landscape. There aren't obvious repeating patterns or strokes that would indicate artificiality. Instead, the distribution of colors and textures adds to the sense of depth and realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lake surface uniformly reflective with no visible distortion, warping, or artificial shine that breaks the continuity of the mountain's reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake has a reflective quality, but due to the nature of the miniaturized and contained setup within a glass, it does not fully depict a reflection like a real lake. The reflection, though artistically interpreted, doesn't align with the reflective fidelity seen in natural waterscapes. The editing context indicates an artistic decision rather than a natural flaw.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chalet figurines positioned at ground level along the shoreline with proper scale and shadow alignment, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalet figurines are placed on the landscape within the bowl and appear proportionally consistent with the size of the trees and mountain setting. They are casting shadows that align with a light source, suggesting careful consideration of lighting and perspective, adding credibility to the scene's realism and depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, distortions, or artificial reflections around the perimeter of the scene that suggest an unnatural glass boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the scene contained within a glass sphere, which inherently includes some reflection and distortion along the perimeter due to the shape of the glass. These reflections and distortions are natural for a setting within a glass containment rather than indicative of a flaw in editing or rendering, consistent with the expectation of a glass environment.",
