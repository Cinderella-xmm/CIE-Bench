    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D figure inside the snow globe is depicted with exaggerated and stylized proportions, which is a characteristic of the chibi art style. Chibi figures typically have larger heads and smaller bodies, which can be perceived as distorted when compared to realistic human proportions. Despite this stylization, the figure does appear to capture the essence of a mid-action skateboarding pose, similar to Image A, but it does so within the artistic boundaries of the chibi style. Therefore, while the proportions are intentionally stylized, they fit the intended aesthetic without undermining the depiction of motion.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny palm trees and ramps are miniaturized versions of real-world objects, adapted to fit into the snow globe environment. The visual integration is seamless, with smooth textures and intact geometric shapes, which give them a coherent and natural appearance within the context of the chibi-style snow globe. They complement the overall aesthetic and do not display any unnatural elements or broken geometries.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "The character's clothing and skateboard in Image B are represented with stylistic simplicity, typical of a chibi-style figure. While they do not possess the intricate details or natural textures seen in realistic depictions like Image A, they do retain recognizable elements such as the black t-shirt, brown pants, and the skateboard, which aligns with the aesthetic purpose of the chibi style. However, 'fine details' in the traditional sense are minimized to fit the whimsical nature of the design.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a snow globe with a clear glass dome, resting on a wooden base, with gentle light reflecting and scattering through the glass. The sun rays and soft highlights on the glass effectively emulate the behavior of light interacting with such a translucent object, giving it a believable and visually pleasing presentation. These effects contribute to the overall credibility of the snow globe's presence within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?",
    "explanation": "The snow inside the snow globe in Image B is depicted as small white specks scattered throughout the interior, which mimics the appearance of snow or snow-like particles. This effect is commonly used in snow globes to create a dynamic and festive atmosphere. The distribution and size of the snow particles are consistent with traditional snow globe designs, and they blend well into the scene, enhancing the chibi-style action without appearing out of place or artificial.",
    "answer": "Yes"
