      "question": "Does the shimmering mane formed from the water maintain fluid motion and transparency consistent with the original waterfall, without appearing solid or rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane of the dragon appears to be created from the original waterfall's water. The mane maintains the fluid motion and transparency observed in the waterfall in Image A. This indicates a consistency in the treatment of water as a dynamic and flowing element, rather than a solid or rigid one.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale patterns on the transformed rock body seamlessly integrated with the original stone texture, without visible seams, unnatural repetition, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scale patterns appear smoothly integrated with the dragon's body that is depicted as emerging from the stone texture of the original landscape. There are no evident seams or signs of unnatural repetition or distortion that would detract from the natural appearance of the dragon as part of the rocky environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cloud wings formed from the foam extend naturally from the dragon’s body and align with the direction of water movement, without appearing detached or floating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's wings seem formed from the foam and integrate well into the scene’s movement. They align with the direction and flow of the water, complementing the overall dynamic motion, and do not appear detached or as if they are unnaturally floating in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing blue runes embedded into the scales with smooth, diffused light emission and no sharp edges or unnatural brightness that disrupts the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing blue runes on the dragon emit a smooth and diffused light that merges well with the surrounding scales. There are no sharp edges or excessive brightness that would disrupt the continuity of the dragon’s texture, which helps maintain the natural appearance of the beast.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon’s body and wings match the direction and intensity of natural sunlight in the original scene, without conflicting illumination or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the dragon's body and wings in Image B is consistent with the natural sunlight observed in Image A. Shadows and highlights match the direction and intensity expected from the illumination seen on the rocks and water, thereby avoiding any conflicting lighting effects or floating highlights that would appear out of place in the scene.",
