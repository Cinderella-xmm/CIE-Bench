    "Question": "Q1: Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous panels are integrated into the structure, but visibly do not follow the same curvature as the original shape in Image A. It appears that they are fitted onto a new structure, which may suggest variations in surface alignment. This indicates gaps or seams might be present due to differences in curvature.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "The digital panels in Image B exhibit neon animations with sharp, continuous light patterns. The colors and details maintain a high resolution without showing signs of pixelation or fragmentation, providing a cohesive visual."]
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
    "explanation": "The synthetic foliage in Image B glows with a soft, even light, producing a vibrant and coherent illumination. The plant forms possess distinct structural elements and depth, avoiding a flat or decal-like appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic surfaces of surrounding buildings exhibit accurate reflections and subtle variations in texture, maintaining a realistic representation without distortion or stretched textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates that the transformed head and pedestal are well-aligned with the horizon and nearby buildings, maintaining consistent perspective and orientation without angular distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
