      "question": "Is the elephant's size reduced proportionally so that its limbs, head, and body maintain correct relative proportions and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears to be placed within a display case, suggesting a reduced size compatible with the enclosure. Examining the elephant's limbs, head, and body, they seem proportionate and realistic in expectation of an appropriately scaled-down replica. The proportions are consistent with those expected of an elephant sculpture, indicating that the resizing process was proportionate.",

      "question": "Do the golden inlays follow the contours and patterns of the original wood carvings without creating abrupt edges or mismatched material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden inlays on the elephant in Image B appear to follow the natural contours and original patterns of the wood carvings. The inlays blend smoothly into the body of the elephant without any noticeable abrupt edges or transitions that would suggest an inconsistency in material integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bonsai trees positioned at a scale consistent with the miniaturized elephant and do they exhibit natural leaf shapes, branch structures, and ground-level placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bonsai trees in Image B are small relative to the elephant, which is consistent with the concept of miniaturization. The trees show realistic branch structures and leaf shapes typical of bonsai designs. Additionally, their placement around the elephant is logical, contributing to the aesthetic without overwhelming the primary subject, suggesting a careful matching of scales.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the miniature jungle feature natural earthy tones and textures such as soil, moss, and plant matter that are consistent with real-world botanical materials and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jungle scene surrounding the elephant utilizes a color palette of earthy tones with believable textures resembling real vegetation and moss. The lighting also matches the setup, simulating how light would naturally fall on such materials, enhancing realism and consistency with natural environments.",

      "question": "Is the new stone base smooth and polished with clear, continuous floral engravings that do not exhibit jagged lines, missing segments, or inconsistent depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone base in Image B is rendered with a polished finish. The floral engravings are clear and well-defined, presenting smooth lines and continuous patterns without interruption or roughness, contributing to the overall aesthetic and maintaining the visual quality expected of a carefully crafted display base.",
