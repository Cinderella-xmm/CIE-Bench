      "question": "Does the chibi version of the scientist retain the white lab coat and light blue shirt without any unnatural distortions in shape or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi scientist is depicted with facial features that are typical in chibi art, such as exaggerated heads and simplified body details. The white lab coat and light blue shirt are clearly visible in the character's design. The stylization of chibi art often leads to a simplified texture, which does not equate to unnatural distortions but rather an intended art style. Therefore, in the context of chibi art's expectations, the depiction is appropriate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scientist's beard and hair depicted naturally in the chibi style, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair in chibi style is simplified with minimal detail but it is consistent with the chibi art style, characterized by clean lines and solid fills. Details such as strands or texture are often omitted intentionally in this art style, so the depiction does not include a beard, nor does it feature extensive hair detailing, which is customary and appropriate for chibi representations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements, including the bright green color and hexagonal patterns, enhance the chibi scientist stickers without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bright green background color in Image B helps the chibi characters stand out. The background elements such as hexagonal patterns are visually consistent with the theme of scientific research and do not introduce any visual artifacts. They enhance the overall visual appeal of the stickers rather than disrupt it, fitting the playful and vibrant nature of chibi design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In all six poses, do the scientist's hands have the correct number of fingers and appear naturally shaped without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi representation simplifies the anatomy significantly, often reducing hand features to very basic shapes or even omitting fingers in some instances. This is an accepted and intentional style choice in chibi art and does not reflect a distortion or error, but for any specific expectations about finger count and natural shape, Image B does not adhere to realistic standards.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scientist's expressions and actions in all six poses coherent and visually plausible, without any unnatural or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style in Image B includes exaggerated expressions and dynamic poses, consistent with the playful and whimsical characteristics of this art form. The actions are clear, and the facial expressions add to the personality of the character, maintaining coherence without distortion in the context of chibi artwork.",
