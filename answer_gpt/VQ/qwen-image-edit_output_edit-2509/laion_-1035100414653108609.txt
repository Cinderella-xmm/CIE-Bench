    "Question": "Q1: Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the moss textures on the tusks appear to follow the natural curvature of the tusks, adhering to their form. The shading and highlights present on the moss textures seem consistent with the lighting direction, which suggests attention to detail in terms of realistic shadow casting on a curved surface. Considering the warthog’s modified fantasy appearance, the textures maintain visual coherence without distracting discrepancies.",
