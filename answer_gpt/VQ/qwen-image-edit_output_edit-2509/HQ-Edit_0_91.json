    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they maintain natural contours without exaggerated or distorted lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the face itself is blurred and cannot be assessed, the proportions visible on the shoulders and neck suggest an adherence to human anatomy. Therefore, one would assume the facial features follow suit, barring the lack of evidence due to blurring.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents follow the existing pattern flow and appear integrated into the textile without unnatural highlights or floating textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf accents on the robe seem to blend seamlessly with the textile's pattern, maintaining a natural flow and integration with the overall design, with no signs of floating or detached textures. This suggests good craftsmanship in integrating the gold leaf.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, proper joint structure, and natural skin texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands appear to be highly illustrative, yet they maintain the correct anatomical structure with five fingers each, preserving joint details and surface linework typical of hands, indicating proper anatomical representation without noticeable distortion or unnatural stretching.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral outlines extend naturally from the robe into the indigo border without sudden breaks, inconsistent linework, or misaligned patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral outlines extend smoothly towards the indigo border, exhibiting consistent linework and aligned patterns without noticeable breaks, aligning with illustrations that emphasize congruence and flow into borders seamlessly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the textile materials retain visible texture variation and depth, avoiding flatness or pixelation that would suggest degraded quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textile is depicted in a stylized manner with designed patterns that suggest texture variation. While it uses an illustrative style, it avoids pixelation and maintains depth through shading and patterning, indicating quality retention.",
