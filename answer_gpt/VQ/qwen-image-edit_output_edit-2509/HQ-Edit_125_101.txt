    "Question": "Q3: Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
    "explanation": "The snowflakes within the globe are dispersed evenly and display a natural randomness that suggests variability in size and shape. They float in a manner that isn't clumped or repetitive, adding to the realism expected in a snow globe. This dispersal pattern mirrors typical snowfall within these decorative items.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
    "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower and Parisian landmarks inside the snow globe are proportionally scaled down to fit the miniature setting, maintaining structural integrity and geometric correctness. The perspective and details are preserved accurately, allowing the viewer to recognize the landmarks without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome is smooth and exhibits natural optical refraction, slightly distorting and bending the view of the internal elements as expected from such a shape. The curvature is consistent, with no jagged edges or sharp transitions, creating a realistic representation of how glass would affect the internal view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
