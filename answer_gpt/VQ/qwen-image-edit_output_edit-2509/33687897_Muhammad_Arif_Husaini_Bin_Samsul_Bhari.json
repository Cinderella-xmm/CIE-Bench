      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the stone-like texture applied to the mountain's surface exhibit uniformity and natural variation in roughness, without visible artifacts like repeating patterns or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain's surface has been altered to feature a creature with a stone-like texture. The texture appears consistent with natural stone textures, showing variability in roughness, which is typical of natural stone surfaces in the real world. This indicates an attempt to mimic nature, with no repetitive patterns or abrupt transitions that would suggest artificial manipulation or errors in texture application. This suggests that the texture application is achieved with a high level of detail and care to maintain uniformity and natural variation, avoiding artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rock-carved eyes positioned symmetrically and proportionally on the mountain’s peak, with realistic depth and integration into the terrain, avoiding floating or misplaced features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature that replaces the mountain has eyes that appear to be carved directly, displaying symmetry and proportionality typical of skilled artistic renderings. These eyes are embedded into the 'stone' surface, showing depth and integration into the 'terrain,' typical of carvings that are intentionally designed to appear as part of the original structure. There are no signs that the eyes are floating or misplaced, therefore they are well-positioned and integrated into the design of the mountain-creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing-like ridges extend from the mountain’s sides in a way that follows natural geological lines and does not introduce sharp, broken, or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The altered mountain in Image B now features wing-like extensions that are meant to represent a fantastical creature. These wings extend smoothly from the sides of the creature, primarily following natural lines that could be akin to geological formations, given their seamless integration and lack of broken lines or physically impossible angles. The transition from the body of the creature to the wings is fluid and visually plausible within the context of a single, unified entity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the creature integrated with the tree silhouettes in a way that avoids visual conflicts such as overlapping branches appearing behind solid limbs or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the fantastical creature are integrated into the environment quite skillfully. They do not overlap with the tree silhouettes in a way that creates visual inconsistencies, such as branches appearing through the solid parts of limbs. The limbs and the tree silhouettes remain visually distinct, with the creature's limbs appearing in front and maintaining a consistent, solid form. There are no visible disconnected joints, suggesting that the integration is seamless without visual conflicts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminous veins emit a soft glow that blends with the blue and pink hues of the sky, without creating bright halos, sharp edges, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminous veins that run through the creature in Image B emit a subtle, soft glow that complements the surrounding environment. This gentle illumination blends harmoniously with the sky's natural pink and blue gradients, avoiding any bright halos or harsh edges that would disrupt the image's cohesion. There are no overexposed areas seen in the integration of light and color in the image, indicating skilled manipulation to maintain visual harmony.",
