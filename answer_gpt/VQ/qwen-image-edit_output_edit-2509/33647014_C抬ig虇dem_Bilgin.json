      "question": "Does the transformed king have smooth, flowing contours resembling water without jagged edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed king in Image B is depicted with a design resembling water, characterized by smooth, flowing contours. This effect is achieved through gentle curves and seamless lines, which suggest the aquatic theme without any jagged edges or disconnected pieces. The visual representation is clean and cohesive, simulating the fluid nature of water.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flame elements on the transformed queen composed of layered, tapering shapes that follow natural fire motion without abrupt transitions or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed queen features flame elements in her design. These flames are constructed using layered, tapering shapes that mimic the natural motion of fire. There are no abrupt transitions, and the lines are smooth without pixelated edges, creating a dynamic yet cohesive representation of fire.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the transformed knights display consistent stone texture with clear carving lines and no distorted proportions or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knights in Image B are portrayed with a stone texture that appears consistent throughout the piece. The carving lines are clear and defined, ensuring that the details are distinct. There are no distorted proportions or fragments that seem to float away from the main structure, maintaining the integrity of the stone appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the transformed bishops rendered with soft, gradient edges and flowing lines that suggest motion without visible pixelation or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed bishops in Image B are characterized by soft, gradient edges that create flowing lines. This design choice suggests motion and is smoothly executed, as there is no visible pixelation or ghosting that would detract from the seamless appearance.",

      "question": "Do the transformed pawns show uniform glow without haloing or blurred outlines that separate them from the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pawns exhibit a uniform glow that is incorporated into the design without creating haloing effects or blurred outlines. This ensures that they remain visually integrated with the board, maintaining their distinct edges while glowing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question": "Does the transformed rook feature a tree trunk with visible bark texture and legible runes without stretching or warping of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed rook in Image B is designed with a tree trunk theme. The bark texture is visible and runs throughout the structure without any signs of stretching or warping. Additionally, the runes on the trunk are legible, contributing to a well-executed thematic design.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows beneath all transformed pieces align with the light direction and object height, without appearing detached or incorrectly sized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows of all transformed pieces are aligned with the direction of light, considering the height of the objects. The shadows do not appear detached or incorrectly sized, as they accurately mirror the scale and position of their respective pieces.",
