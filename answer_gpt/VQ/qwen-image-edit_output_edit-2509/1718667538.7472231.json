    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger face exhibits cleanly defined edges without any pixelation or broken lines. The consistent thickness and solid lines indicate a high-quality rendering, which is distinct from any signs of poor rendering. The geometric style further supports this clean line definition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers are symmetrically aligned on both sides of the tiger’s face. The proportions are consistent with the facial structure, contributing to a balanced appearance. The uniformity of the stripes and whiskers provides symmetry which adheres to typical design principles for aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the kimono panels with clear separation and distinct edges. These layers do not overlap improperly or float, suggesting a well-executed design. The layering appears natural and structured, reflecting proper clothing design principles where layers are distinctly visible without visual interference.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold foil elements are integrated with the floral pattern, displaying consistent reflectivity. There are no harsh highlights or fragments that appear to float or seem detached from the main floral design, suggesting that these elements are well-blended and integrated naturally within the art style.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detachable panels in Image B are aligned with natural garment seams and appear securely attached. There is no indication of floating or incorrect intersection with other parts of the clothing, which suggests careful attention to garment design where detachable elements follow natural seams and fold lines to maintain structural integrity.",
