      "question": "Does the robotic dog holding a coin blend seamlessly with the parking meterâ€™s timer area, maintaining its structural coherence and avoiding obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robotic dog is positioned on the parking meter's top surface, seemingly holding a coin. Visually, it appears integrated into the scene without conspicuous edges or blending issues that disrupt the parking meter's timer area. The addition maintains the meter's overall structure, and the integration seems smooth without evident unnatural artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the robotic dog and the coin appear consistent with the rest of the parking meter, avoiding any unnatural or out-of-place surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows that the robotic dog and the coin have a metallic look, consistent with the parking meter's metal surface. The metallic sheen and reflections match the realistic portrayal of objects within the meter environment, avoiding any stark contrast or out-of-place appearance.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the positioning of the robotic dog within the timer area proportional and physically realistic, without distorting or disrupting the geometry of the parking meter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robotic dog is scaled properly, appearing proportional in size compared to the parking meter it sits on. Its presence does not warp or distort the geometry of the meter, suggesting it was carefully placed to maintain spatial realism and coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the robotic dog holding a coin logically coexist with the parking meter's billing function, ensuring both actions appear plausible and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the robotic dog holding a coin does not directly interfere with the operation of the parking meter, its presence doesn't relate to the billing function either. The functionality of a parking meter is unrelated to the depiction of a robotic dog, making the coexistence seem implausible in terms of functionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire composition of the edited image, including the robotic dog and coin, appear authentic and consistent with the original scene without introducing any distracting or incongruous elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates the robotic dog and coin smoothly into the context of the parking meter, but the presence of a robotic figure and coin is an artificial addition, possibly seen as a novelty or humorous twist. This doesn't typically belong in such scenes, therefore slightly detracting from the authentic consistency of the overall urban environment depicted.",
