        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the top hat appears to be positioned correctly on the capybara's head, maintaining the natural shape of the head without visible distortion. The seams or texture mismatches are not noticeable, making the hat integrate seamlessly with the character. This indicates a well-executed editing job.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teacup is seen being held by the capybara’s paws. The angle and scale seem proportionate to its form and there is no indication of deformation or floating, suggesting it appears naturally in the capybara's grasp.",

      "question": "Does the suit worn by the capybara exhibit consistent fabric texture, natural draping, and appropriate seam lines that follow the animal’s body contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B exhibits a consistent fabric texture, with natural-looking draping that follows the contours of the capybara’s body. The seam lines are appropriately placed, contributing to a realistic portrayal of the suit on the animal.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the monocle sitting well over the area of the eye. There is no unnatural overlap with the fur or rendering artifacts like ghosting or misalignment. This indicates proper placement and editing of the monocle.",
