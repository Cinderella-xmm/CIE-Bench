    "Question": "Q3: Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
    "explanation": "The figures within the snow globe in Image B appear to have complete, correctly proportioned limbs without any noticeable distortions, extra fingers, or missing parts. This suggests careful attention to detail to maintain realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the autumn-colored leaves blend seamlessly into the surrounding green vegetation. There are no abrupt transitions or blocky textures; the colors transition naturally, indicating a well-executed integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "The snow particles in Image B are distributed in a dynamic, swirling pattern that enhances the snow globe's aesthetic. They do not obscure the Great Wall or the figures inside, which remain clearly visible, indicating a balanced design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic birds are discernible as distinct flying objects, with defined wings and bodies, positioned above the Great Wall without interacting with other surfaces, maintaining spatial and perspective integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
    "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B is dark and exhibits a realistic grain texture. It securely supports the snow globe, showing no signs of floating or tilting. The engraved text is legible, confirming both the artistic and functional quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
