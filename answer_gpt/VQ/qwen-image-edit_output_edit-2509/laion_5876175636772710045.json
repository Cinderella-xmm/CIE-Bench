      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the flowing skirt of the womanâ€™s gown composed of layered, translucent fabric with natural ruffles and soft gradients, and do the jeweled accents appear embedded rather than pasted on?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's gown features a flowing skirt with several layers, demonstrating a gradient of colors and natural ruffles. The jeweled accents appear as part of the fabric design rather than superficially attached, suggesting a seamless incorporation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the marble floor tiles display continuous veining patterns and subtle reflections, and are the chandeliers structurally sound with clear crystal elements and warm light diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble floor tiles have consistent veining patterns that enhance the realistic look of the floor, accompanied by subtle reflections that are indicative of a polished marble surface. The chandeliers show clear crystal elements and diffuse warm light evenly across the room, reflecting an accurate representation of structural soundness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the dancers soft and directional, consistent with overhead chandeliers, and do they blend smoothly into the surrounding environment without sharp boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while evaluating the lighting, it appears the dancers do not cast any discernible shadows that comply with the observed directionality from overhead chandeliers. The environment lacks observable shadows that smoothly blend without sharp boundaries, indicating inconsistency.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancers' hands can be seen engaged in contact. Despite close scrutiny, the visible hand does not show an evident error in digit count or overlapping/missing fingers, and the skin texture appears consistent with realistic representation, confirming accuracy in joint alignment.",
