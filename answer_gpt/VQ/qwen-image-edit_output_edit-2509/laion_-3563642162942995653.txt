    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is depicted with a crystalline structure, with clear defined facets that create a smooth, angular appearance. The cabin and the body of the truck are constructed to reflect the original panel lines but now embody a polished, faceted surface, typical of cut glass or crystal. The design appears coherent with no visible breaks or misaligned edges, maintaining uniformity across the crystal facets, in alignment with the original truck's lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels of the truck are represented as transparent crystalline structures. They visually match the size and spacing of the wheels in Image A, where the truck has muddy wheels. The alignment of the axles appears consistent, and there are no indications of the wheels floating or being misplaced. The truck's stability and mechanical alignment seem intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wheels are crafted to simulate an internal structure reminiscent of a natural crystal lattice. They appear detailed and follow the contours of the original metal hubs and rims. The lines are smooth and consistent, representing a crafted outlook typical of quartz-like materials, aligning with the construction in the original metal wheels in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is displayed on a white marble platform. The marble surface is shown to be even and flat, supporting the entire length of the crystal truck. The base appears continuous with no visible gaps, ensuring the inner structure of the truck rests securely atop, grounded as would be expected for a display piece.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the truck exhibit qualities akin to gemstones like emerald and jade, characterized by subtle color refraction and reflections. This representation is consistent with the properties of such materials, showing depth and vibrancy without the presence of unnatural glowing patches or chromatic aberrations typically caused by artifacts from editing or rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
