      "question": "Are the polar bears fully intact, with their proportions and textures appearing natural and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the polar bears appear natural with appropriate proportions and realistic textures that match with commonly understood appearance of polar bears. There are no visible distortions or unnatural alterations in their physical structure when observed within the context of the image environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cooled color tone appear seamlessly integrated into the environment, avoiding unnatural color gradients or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a cooled color tone applied which results in a more blue-tinted appearance. Upon analysis, the integration of this color tone does not show unnatural gradients or patches that would disrupt the continuity of the snow and ice background. It maintains a consistent look reflective of cold, icy environments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the bold headline \"Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.\" free of jagged edges or pixelation and does not obscure important details of the ice and bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headline text in Image B is bold and clear without any jagged edges or pixelation that typically results from low-quality text rendering. Additionally, the placement of the text in the upper portion ensures that it does not obscure the visual details of the polar bears or ice, aligning with sturdy design practices.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the organization logo and website at the bottom legible yet unobtrusive, ensuring they do not interfere with the depiction of the ice and bears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The organization logo and website in Image B are positioned at the bottom left and right respectively. Both elements are legible with clear design. They are unobtrusive as their positioning does not interfere with or detract focus from the central depiction of the ice and bears.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the combination of the modified image elements, including the text and logo, uphold a realistic and coherent style without creating any visually confusing elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition consisting of the cooled tone, bold headline, and logo maintains a coherent style. Each element complements the environmental theme without introducing any visually confusing elements. The simplicity of the design ensures the message is conveyed clearly without overwhelming details.",
