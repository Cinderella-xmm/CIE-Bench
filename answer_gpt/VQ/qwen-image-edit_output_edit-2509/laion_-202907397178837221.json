      "question": "Do the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers align precisely with the original building outlines, showing no distorted edges or misaligned blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers are modified with a glowing, pixel-patterned facade that follows the structure of the original buildings. Visually, the edited facades maintain a clean alignment with the architectural outlines noted in Image A, with no discernible distortion or misalignment of blocks. This indicates precision in the editing, ensuring the facades are transformed without compromising their structural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the angular digital circuits forming the trees connected logically from base to tip, with no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are stylized with neon light circuits that trace from the base to the tip of the tree structures. By analyzing the visual pattern, it is apparent that these digital circuits are logically connected, forming complete paths that represent the tree's branches and trunks. There are no visible floating or disconnected segments, suggesting a coherent and intentional design.",

      "question": "Do the neon lights along the bridge run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels without gaps or incorrect bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge is adorned with neon lights that highlight the rail tracks and the side panels. When closely examining the path of these lights, it appears they maintain continuity and follow the structure of the bridge without gaps or unnatural bends. This continuous pattern ensures a visually pleasing and unbroken neon effect throughout the bridge's length and surface.",

      "question": "Are all skyscrapers in the skyline uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, with no partial or missing conversions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each skyscraper in the skyline is transformed into a pixel-patterned luminous tower. These pixel patterns are consistently applied across the entire skyline, making each building appear uniformly illuminated without partial or missing conversions. The editing ensures a homogenous visual style where all elements are fully converted, maintaining the facade appearance across all structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the window grids on the buildings, the individual beams of the bridge, and the foliage of non-digital trees still clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ordinary window grids on the buildings, the beams of the bridge, and the natural appearance of tree foliage have been heavily stylized or altered into digital circuits and patterns. The original details like grids, beams, and foliage have been replaced or overlaid with neon designs which focus more on a digital aesthetic than preserving the original clarity and structure seen in Image A. Therefore, the editing does not maintain these original elements' visibility or detail.",
