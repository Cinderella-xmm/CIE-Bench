      "question": "Does the gold spoon maintain the same structural coherence as the original fork with no unnatural texture or distortion in the handle and bowl area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the gold spoon is shown with a clear outline and detailed texture on the handle. The bowl of the spoon appears smooth and rounded, consistent with typical spoon design. It maintains structural integrity similar to what would be expected of a real spoon with no indication of distortion. Knowledge of spoon design helps confirm this appearance aligns with expected characteristics of a spoon, unlike a fork with visible prongs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the gold spoon and the napkin appear natural without disrupting the napkin’s texture or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon rests on the napkin seamlessly, without causing any visible disruption or misalignment in the napkin's folding or creases. The shadows and texture around the spoon match the surrounding fabric, indicating a realistic placement without altering the napkin’s appearance in an unnatural way. Common knowledge of how flatware interacts with textile surfaces supports this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the gold spoon integrate naturally with the scene and appear as part of the spoon rather than a separate overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the spoon handle are not only detailed but also align perfectly with the contours of the spoon. This suggests that the patterns are integral to the spoon’s design rather than an applied overlay. The engravings follow typical decorative utensil designs, indicating they are part of the spoon's craftsmanship as would be expected in real life.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the gold spoon exhibit realistic reflectivity and shine consistent with a metallic spoon under the lighting conditions of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon displays a shine and reflectivity characteristic of polished metal under lighting. The reflected light and shadows indicate a smooth metallic surface responding naturally to the ambient light, resonating well with knowledge of how reflective materials behave in photographs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the size and positioning of the gold spoon proportionate and physically logical in relation to the napkin, avoiding any unusual scaling issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold spoon’s size appears consistent and proportional to the napkin, as would be typical for a spoon placed in this context. There are no apparent scaling issues or disproportionate areas, ensuring the spoon fits logically within the scene, similar to the original setup used for the fork.",
