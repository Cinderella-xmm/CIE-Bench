      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the head-to-body ratio reflects common stylistic choices in chibi or caricature art, often crafting larger heads relative to the body for aesthetic appeal without distortion. This can be structurally coherent if facial features are appropriately placed, maintaining symmetry without warping. The face here adheres to that style while maintaining coherence and alignment.",

      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B shows the lamb nestled in the figure's lap, with a realistic posture and soft, fluffy texture that enhances natural aesthetics. It's cradled securely without showing any signs of clipping or unnatural suspension, fitting comfortably within the hands. This realistic positioning mimics how an actual object might be held.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly show the eyes, thus making a definitive judgement is challenging without seeing them. However, if they are discernable, typically chibi styles feature enlarged eyes that align symmetrically to retain coherence, without distortion with respect to other facial features.",
