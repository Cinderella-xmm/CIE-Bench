      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panel features straight and well-defined lines in the architecture, particularly in the rooflines, gables, and timber framing. These lines are indicative of a paper-cut style, where sharp and angular edges are prominent. The lack of rounded or blurred transitions contributes to a clean, crisp appearance that aligns with traditional paper-cut aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges appear uniformly applied with consistent reflectivity and no pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold foil accents in Image B are depicted as smooth and uniformly applied, maintaining a consistent appearance throughout the window frames and flower box edges. The texture appears clean without noticeable pixelation or smudging, suggesting a high-quality application and maintaining an even reflectivity characteristic of foil accents.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the crimson color of the entrance awning evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting direction, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entrance awning in Image B has a uniformly applied crimson color that remains consistent across its surface. There are no abrupt changes in hue or color shifts, and the lighting effects are well-blended, avoiding any unnatural shadowing. This consistent application suggests a deliberate design choice to maintain evenness in color representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric arch borders cleanly aligned with the edges of the image and do they not overlap or distort any part of the building's structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric arch borders are meticulously placed, aligning perfectly with the edges and not intervening in the building’s structure. These borders transition seamlessly into the image’s framework, enhancing the visual harmony without causing any distortion or overlap with the building elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edge of the image appear clean and continuous without visible clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that suggest improper trimming or rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of Image B are smooth and well-defined, showcasing precision in design. There is no evidence of clipping, jagged edges, or missing pixels around the periphery, indicating that the trimming and rendering processes were executed properly, ensuring a polished and continuous appearance of the image boundaries.",
