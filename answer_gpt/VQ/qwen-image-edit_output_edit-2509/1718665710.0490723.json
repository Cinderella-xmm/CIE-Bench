      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's head appears slightly larger in proportion to the body, which is typical for chibi-style figures. This style exaggerates head size for a cute effect without necessarily distorting features. The hair retains its curls without appearing flattened. Given the chibi style's exaggerated proportions, this change is intentional and does not appear awkward or distorted in the context of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black outlines uniformly thick and cleanly separated from internal details such as hair, skin, and armor engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the edited version in chibi toy form, it appears that the figure is designed with a smooth surface and lacks any black outlines typical of a drawn style, focusing on portraying the figure in a three-dimensional form rather than through line art. Thus, there are no outlines separating internal details, as might be observed in hand-drawn images.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a small, chibi-style character with armor designed to mimic the appearance of metal. The glossy reflections on the armor are consistent, with smooth color transitions, likely mimicking light reflection on curved surfaces. There is no visible pixelation or repeated textures, indicating a high-quality rendering typical of professionally made 3D character merchandises or renderings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate maintain symmetry and clear definition. Their edges appear well-defined without irregularities or distortions, reflecting a high level of attention to design consistency in the smaller, stylized version of the armor. This consistent design approach ensures that the chibi figure maintains visual coherence, focusing on simplicity and clarity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the silver chain appears to be attached at a coherent central point on top of the head, common for keychains. Each link is similarly shaped, and the connection between the chain and the figure appears secure and appropriately scaled, fitting the overall chibi design. The chain's attachment aligns with typical keychain structures, suggesting physical feasibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the background exhibit a uniform dark texture with no bright reflections or unnatural gradients, consistent with velvet material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a deep, dark hue consistent across the image, exhibiting no bright reflections or distracting gradients. The uniform texture suggests a velvet-like material, as velvet is known for its ability to absorb light and minimize reflections, which supports the design choice for the background to not detract from the figure.",
