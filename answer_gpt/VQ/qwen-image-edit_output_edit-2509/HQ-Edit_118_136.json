      "question": "Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic armor in Image B is designed to look futuristic and streamlined, with attention to how it conforms to the body's natural shape and movements. The segments appear to align with human anatomy, without displaying unnatural bends or stretching, common in interpretations of futuristic suits in visual media.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hoverboard’s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hoverboard is depicted with a sleek, continuous transparent deck, maintaining its shape and consistency throughout, and it has well-integrated glow effects that do not show any signs of digital mishaps such as broken edges or artifacts. This aligns with common depictions of futuristic tech ensuring design fluidity and visual coherence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not focus on graffiti-like elements; instead, it emphasizes neon displays characteristic of a digital cityscape. Animated digital displays would imply movement or light transitions. The neon signs in Image B typically appear smooth—reflective of careful digital rendering, without visible pixelation or jaggedness.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon highlights are designed to cast a subtle glow that enhances the futuristic atmosphere. The glow appears soft and even, avoiding harsh reflections or unrealistic color bleeding seen in poor visual effects. Such visual integrity is expected for high-quality digital illustration intending to maintain realism within a stylistic portrayal.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses motion lines effectively to enhance the dynamic feel of the scene. The lines align with the skater's movement trajectory, suggesting speed and direction without interfering with or awkwardly intersecting the main visuals, a standard technique in dynamic illustrations to avoid visual confusion or distractions.",
