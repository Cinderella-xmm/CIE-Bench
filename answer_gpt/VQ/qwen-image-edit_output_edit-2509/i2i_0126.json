      "question": "Are the proportions of both characters consistent and free from distortion in their respective views within the combined illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the characters are proportioned correctly, we analyze their appearance in Image B using world knowledge about human anatomy and common artistic standards for character depiction. Each character retains sensible proportions such as their body-to-head ratio and limb length. There are no elements of distortion like stretched limbs or unnatural body shapes, which indicates consistency across views.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the textures of the office elements such as chairs, plants, and desks appear natural and retain fine details without obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B requires an inspection of textures like the chairs, plants, and desk surfaces. Analysis combines world knowledge of office object textures, expecting clarity and coherent details as seen in real environments. The chairs have smooth textures, the plants showcase defined leaves, and the desks are depicted with typical office surface textures, all without noticeable artifacts such as excessive pixelation or color irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the computer screens realistic with sharp images, and does the interaction between the characters and screens appear natural without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, computer screens should display clear visuals representing typical screen outputs. The characters' interaction appears natural, aligning well with world knowledge of ergonomic behavior, showing correct posture sitting at desks. Additionally, both screens contain sharp and precise representations without signs of pixelation or mismatched elements like misaligned screen placement or interaction errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the characters align correctly with their environment, maintaining a plausible spatial relationship and avoiding any broken geometric shapes or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess spatial alignment in Image B, it involves reviewing the characters' placement relative to the environment, looking for logical positioning with chairs and desks. World knowledge assists in recognizing proportions and geometry in indoor spaces, ensuring characters do not intersect strangely with objects around them. Everything appears mathematically consistent in terms of scale and positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting, including the hanging lampâ€™s shadow and the light on the characters, maintain consistency and contribute to the natural appearance of the scene without unnatural contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B requires evaluation of lighting effects and shadows. Conducted using world knowledge of indoor lighting setups, it assesses for coherent light sourcing ensuring natural shadow casting and character illumination. The interaction appears seamless without harsh contrasts or unrealistic shadow placement under consistent light scenarios.",
