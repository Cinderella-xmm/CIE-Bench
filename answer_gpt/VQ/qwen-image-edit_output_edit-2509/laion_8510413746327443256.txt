    "Question": "Q1: Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The holographic dragon eye on the watch face is designed to have a glowing, radiant effect. To determine if it exhibits smooth gradients and consistent lighting, examine the transition of colors and brightness from the center to the edges. A smooth transition means the colors gradually change, and the brightness does not abruptly change or exhibit pixelation. Consistency in lighting ensures there are no areas that unnaturally stand out or appear faded. Based on the image, the dragon eye displays these characteristics well, indicating clean design work without artifacts.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "The silver scales on the band should form a seamless pattern, meaning that each scale aligns neatly with the next. Proper shading would involve a gradual transition in shades that reflect light as it would on a metallic surface. If there are no visible gaps where the band connects or overlaps improperly, the geometric continuity remains intact. The image shows that the scales are aligned and shaded consistently without visible errors, indicating a uniform and unbroken design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?",
    "explanation": "The neural node is designed to appear integrated with the casing, meaning it should seem like a part of the case rather than an add-on. Consistent illumination is evident when the light emitted by the node doesn't show abrupt intensity fluctuations or irregular edges that might suggest distortion. The image reveals that the node is smoothly integrated into the watch's casing, without any visible light leakage or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?",
    "explanation": "Luminescent control sigils should have sharp, well-defined edges, distinguishing them clearly from the background. Consistent brightness levels imply that there are no fluctuating light intensities that might lead to blurring or ghosting, where one might see double images or faded edges. The image depicts the sigils with clear boundaries and steady illumination without any visible blurring, indicating a sharp and precise design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?",
    "explanation": "For a watch, proportional alignment means that all components are in harmony with each other, with none appearing out of place or disproportionate to the rest. Structural coherence involves a seamless connection between different parts without warping or stretching that would indicate a mismatch or misplacement. The image shows all components - case, band, crown, and side button - maintaining proper alignment, indicating a coherent and well-proportioned design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
