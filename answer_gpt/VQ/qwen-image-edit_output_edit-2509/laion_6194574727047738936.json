      "question": "Are the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar proportionally sized and positioned in a way that maintains the original rectangular shape of the bars without distorting their geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and tiny hands added to the cereal bars are proportionally sized such that they do not distort the overall rectangular shape of the bars. The eyes, mouth, and hands are small and placed centrally, keeping the edges and corners of the bars intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cereal bar characters appear to interact with the pink flamingo mug in a physically plausible manner, such as touching or leaning toward it, without violating spatial logic or causing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal bar characters are positioned separately from the pink flamingo mug. They do not appear to be interacting directly with the mug, as there is no physical contact or indication of leaning towards it.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Do the added facial features and hands on the cereal bars preserve the original texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, without introducing unnatural smoothness, sharp edges, or missing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added facial features and hands in Image B blend well with the original texture of the cereal bars. The chocolate and cereal layers retain their natural appearance, with no introduction of unnatural smoothness or loss of detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny hands on the cereal bars have three fingers and a thumb, which is common in cartoon representations, and they are appropriately curved. The shadowing is consistent with the lighting in the scene, giving them a natural appearance.",
