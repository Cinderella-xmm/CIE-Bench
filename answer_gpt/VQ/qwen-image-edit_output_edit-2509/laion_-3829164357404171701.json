      "question": "Are the modified gray ribbons shaped into wings with smooth, symmetrical curves and natural fabric draping that match the original material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ribbons from Image A have been replaced with wings.

      "question": "Do the white flowers have added eyelash-like details that are evenly distributed and seamlessly blended into the petal edges without breaking the flowerâ€™s natural shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white flowers have additional features that resemble eyelashes. These details are located on the top side of the white flowers, appearing to be evenly distributed along the upper petals and seamlessly integrated without disrupting the natural shape of the flower. This modification gives the flowers a whimsical and expressive appearance while maintaining the integrity of their original form.",

      "question": "Are the added antennas positioned near the top of the handle with a clear point of attachment and do they exhibit subtle sparkle effects without overlapping or distorting surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, antennas are added to the bag near the top of the handle. They are clearly attached to the handle, and the sparkle effects are subtle, enhancing the whimsical theme without interfering with or distorting the handle or surrounding details. This careful placement and subtle enhancement allow the antennae to integrate well with the rest of the design.",

      "question": "Is the modified chain forming a continuous, curved tail underneath the bag that retains metallic texture and does not intersect or float above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chain from Image A has been transformed into a tail under the bag, forming a continuous and smoothly curved shape. This tail retains the metallic texture and appears to be naturally laying on the surface, not intersecting other elements or giving an impression of floating. It holds a realistic appearance that complements the mythical creature theme.",
