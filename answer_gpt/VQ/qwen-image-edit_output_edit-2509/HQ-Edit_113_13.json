      "question": "Does the leaf crown on the fox’s head have natural leaf shapes, consistent texture, and proper alignment with the head without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf crown on the fox's head is cartoonish and stylized, but it portrays a clear leafy pattern with smooth and rounded shapes typical of cartoon leaves. The texture is consistent with the style of the illustration, and the crown aligns well with the head without any visible seams or unnatural edges. This indicates the design is intentional and fits well within the art style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fox’s hind legs properly aligned and proportioned when standing upright, with no distorted joints, unnatural curvature, or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox is illustrated in a cartoon style, standing upright with exaggerated proportions typical of chibi designs. The hind legs appear to be aligned and proportioned consistently within this style, without any visible distortions or unnatural bends that would be considered mistakes in a stylized illustration. The limbs are all present and correctly attached.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree outlines in the background maintain clean, continuous lines without jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background trees are drawn with clean, smooth lines typical of cartoon art. There are no jagged edges, and the lines appear continuous and free of overlapping inconsistencies or missing parts. The style is consistent with the overall design of the image, which aims for simplicity and clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied uniformly across the forest floor and foliage without creating unnatural color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of fine details like moss texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel colors are applied evenly across the forest floor and surrounding foliage. Given the cartoon style, there are no instances of color bleeding that would appear unnatural for this type of illustration. There is no pixelation visible, and although the style does not include detailed textures like moss (as it is more stylized), it retains an appropriate consistency within the intended design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned at a plausible distance from the fox, with correct shadowing and edge blending that matches the lighting and depth of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is positioned above the fox, maintaining a standard distance one might expect in this type of cartoon illustration. Since the image is stylized and does not closely follow real-world lighting and depth, shadowing and edge blending are not explicitly detailed. However, the placement and design of the speech bubble are consistent with typical cartoon conventions.",
