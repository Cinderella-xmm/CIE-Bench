      "question": "Does the soft vinyl figurine maintain a consistent texture and material appearance throughout, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is represented with a smooth, consistent texture that aligns with the vinyl material. World knowledge informs us that vinyl typically has a uniform surface and solid coloration, which is visually evident as the figurine does not exhibit any unnatural artifacts such as pixelation or inconsistent texture variations that would detract from its appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine appears to be placed properly on the coffee table, with realistic proportions relative to other elements like the tea set. The figurine's size and position are plausible considering the tabletop dimensions, and world knowledge suggests that such figurines are often small enough to sit comfortably on a table alongside other decor items, without appearing oversized or misplaced.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plants in Image B appear coherent within the scene, exhibiting natural textures and shapes that align with world knowledge about indoor plants. They don't show any unnatural artifacts or textures that would make them look artificial amongst the other elements like the furniture and tea set.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea utensils are proportionate relative to the figurine and are positioned logically on the table. Given world knowledge of regular tea set dimensions, this setup provides a harmonious balance, supporting the overall scene's visual coherence without any disproportionate elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene that is free from visual distortions or artifacts, maintaining realism throughout. The components including the figurine, tea set, and plants are integrated smoothly, with visual cues indicating that artifacts such as blurring or pixelation are not present. This respects world knowledge of realistic edits in photo compositions.",
