      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the olive and dark green LEGO bricks covering the tank's body uniformly aligned and textured, without visible gaps, misaligned blocks, or distorted shapes that break the geometric structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks covering the tank appear to be well-aligned and maintain a consistent texture expected of LEGO constructions. This type of detail is typical for LEGO models where uniformity is achieved through standard brick sizes. The alignment and texture do not exhibit noticeable gaps or distortions, suggesting a consistent geometric structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the colorful LEGO tiger pattern on the front hull maintain the correct proportions and facial features of the original tiger decal, without distortion or missing elements such as eyes, teeth, or stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B's LEGO tiger pattern to the tiger decal in Image A, the LEGO version maintains facial features correctly, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, although in a pixelated format typical of LEGO. However, the original pattern's detail, like stripes, is simplified into blocks of color. Thus, while it preserves facial features, it does not capture the full proportional accuracy of the original decal, which includes finer details and a different style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the LEGO treads exhibit consistent, detailed texture resembling real tank tracks, with no flattened sections or incorrect spacing between the individual tread segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation of the tank treads appears consistent with a typical LEGO design. LEGO texture often simplifies real-life objects into blocky representations. The treads in Image B show consistent spacing and alignment expected of detailed LEGO construction, mimicking the segmented structure of real tank tracks observed in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO tank fully supported by a smooth, continuous wooden platform that matches the surrounding ground level, with no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tank resting on what appears to be a smooth, rectangular wooden platform. The platform sustains the tank evenly, avoiding any visible floating or misalignment relative to the surface it sits on. Unlike Image A, which rests on gravel, Image B uses uniform wooden specificity suitable for a showroom model, thereby matching the expected ground level without perceptible discrepancies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the green LEGO brick back panel blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, showing no sharp edges, unnatural color shifts, or textural inconsistencies compared to the real foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a backdrop made entirely of green LEGO bricks, shaped to imitate natural foliage. Unlike the natural texture in Image A, the LEGO back panel in Image B creates unnatural sharp edges and lacks the gradual color transition characteristic of real foliage. This shows clear textural differences and sharpness, making it stand out rather than blend with a real environmental background.",
