      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the text 'Sharp' at the top left blend naturally into the image without causing any visible disruption to the scissors or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Sharp' is positioned at the top left. Visual cues suggest that the text is integrated into the scene with a sketch style that matches the aesthetic of the edited image. World knowledge indicates that text can be a visual element that either disrupts or enhances imagery, depending on its integration. In this case, the positioning of 'Sharp' seems carefully placed to avoid intersecting with key areas, like the scissors, and complements the overall design without causing disruption.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text 'Clean' at the bottom right rendered in a sketch style that matches the image's aesthetic, without introducing any artifacts or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Clean' in Image B exhibits a sketch style which matches the aesthetic of the edited image. The style of the text is consistent with the artistic treatment applied to the scissors. World knowledge about digital art suggests that matching styles contribute to visual coherency, minimizing artifacts or visual noise caused by mismatched design elements. In this case, the 'Clean' text complements the artistic approach without introducing noticeable artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the scissors preserved, with no apparent distortion in their shape caused by the placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scissors have been stylized with a sketch effect. Despite the addition of text, the natural proportions of the scissors seem to be maintained, as determined by their parallel orientation and typical shape recognizable by common scissors design. Placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean' does not overlap or interfere with the scissors' form, ensuring their proportions remain intact without distortion caused by these additional elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the fine details, like reflections and edges of the scissors, remain sharp and unaffected by the presence of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, though the scissors are rendered with artistic stylization, the fine details like reflections and edges appear to be preserved. The choice of a sketch effect seems to be deliberate, harmonizing the image while maintaining sharpness inherent to metallic reflections. World knowledge suggests reflective surfaces are often replicated in digital art for depth. The presence of text 'Sharp' and 'Clean' appears to have no negative effect on these aspects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the positioning of the scissors and the added texts, appear balanced and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a composition where scissors are centrally positioned with text elements 'Sharp' and 'Clean' tactically placed in the corners. This maintains a sense of balance and spatial organization, which is crucial in visual arts to prevent overwhelming focal points. World knowledge highlights that balanced compositions create pleasing visuals, sustaining viewer engagement by equilibrium among elements. Here, the placement maintains both the plausibility and attractiveness of the image.",
