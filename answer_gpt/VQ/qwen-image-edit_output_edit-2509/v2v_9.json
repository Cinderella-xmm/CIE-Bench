      "question": "Does the creature's body maintain the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the bubble tea cup's shape and texture without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's body is modeled after a bubble tea cup, maintaining the original shape and texture. The cup aspect is preserved, as the top has the clear dome lid and straw sticking out, similar to Image A's design. The colors align with the purple theme, consistent with bubble tea, and the smiling face feature enhances it without distortion. The legs and feet do not disrupt the original cup shape, so it maintains visual plausibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the design elements like tapioca pearls and the straw integrated naturally into the creature's form without appearing as unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tapioca pearls and straw are incorporated logically into the creature design. The pearls are arranged at the bottom of the cup, similar to an actual bubble tea, and the placement appears natural. Similarly, the straw is positioned in a realistic manner for bubble tea, protruding from the lid. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural distortions in the rendering of these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the custom orb or capsule near the creature's feet feature patterns and colors consistent with the bubble tea theme without losing fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb in Image B is designed with a glossy and clear surface, featuring a turquoise color and bubble-like patterns which are coherent and visually plausible. The colors, while vibrant, do not introduce unnatural textures, and align with the whimsical theme seen in bubble tea like the creature's purple theme. It enhances the design without disrupting or losing detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the creature relative to the custom orb/capsule and the overall scene logically consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the creature and the custom orb are balanced, with the orb positioned at the creature’s feet. The orb's size complements the creature’s stature without looking oversized or undersized and maintains scene symmetry. This maintains a logical flow and avoids any visual distortion throughout the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the presentation of the creature's name and elemental type complement the artwork's charm without disrupting the visual flow or introducing distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature’s name and elemental type are introduced as text beside the character. While the text attempts to add context, its placement and irregular font slightly disrupt the cohesive visual effect across the image. It does not complement the whimsical and magical charm evident in the character and custom orb theme, thereby becoming a slight distraction.",
