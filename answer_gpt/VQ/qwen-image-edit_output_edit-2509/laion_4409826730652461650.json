    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes are exaggerated with strong expressions to fit the cartoonish style, and its mouth is more expressive than in a typical plush design. In Image A, the plush horse's eyes are more neutral and softer, consistent with a plush toy look. The artistic alteration in Image B gives the horse a more animated personality, which may not exactly match the original proportions of Image A but serves the stylization purpose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lasso is depicted in an arch above the cowboy's head, suggesting mid-air motion, typical of a twirling lasso. There is no visible intersection or clipping with the horse's body, which is a standard representation in a Western-themed cartoon.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horizon line appears to support the depth with cacti and saloon buildings drawn in perspective. However, the stylization might ignore precise shadow casting on the ground as seen in cartoons where light physics are not always strictly followed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being heavily stylized, does not retain the detailed fur texture or realistic plastic features that Image A (the original product) naturally possesses. Instead, Image B uses simple lines and colors typical in cartoon illustrations, sacrificing texture realism for style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the prominent text at the top does not overlap with the cartoon visuals below. The title is separate from the rest of the image, respecting both visual hierarchy and readability customary in design layouts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylization may lead to distorted proportions, and the mechanical details of the rocking base seen in Image A might not be replicated accurately. This stylistic representation alters the original structure seen in Image A, favoring artistic expression over mechanical accuracy.",
