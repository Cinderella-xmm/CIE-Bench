      "question": "Does the area on the train where people were previously sitting look natural without any obvious artifacts or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where people were removed, the train's structure appears seamless, and there are no visible artifacts such as unnatural textures, color mismatches, or outlines where people were previously present. The appearance of the train's surface seems continuous and consistent with the rest of the train, which indicates a careful editing process to ensure the area looks natural and integrated. In image A, the individuals were visibly sitting atop the train. Image B seems clean with no indicators left of previous alterations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the conductor added atop the train well-integrated with the existing lighting and shadows, giving a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the conductor standing atop the train matches in size and perspective relative to the train. The lighting on the conductor and shadows seem consistent with the direction and intensity of light in the rest of the scene, suggesting that the conductor is well-integrated into the image's lighting scheme. The attire's shadows and highlights align with the overall scene lighting, indicating a successful addition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the flag held by the conductor look natural, with proper proportions and a logical position relative to the train's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag held by the conductor is proportioned correctly to the scale of the conductor and appears to move naturally due to the presumed motion of the train. It holds a realistic position and shape suggesting wind resistance that accompanies moving trains. The flag's integration into the image considers movement dynamics, with flag ripples and positioning indicating motion effect alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any distortions or misalignments in the train's structure near the area where people were removed, and the conductor was added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible distortions or misalignments in the train's structure where people were removed, and the conductor was added. The train's lines remain straight, and its surface features still appear uniform, indicating the editing was carefully executed to maintain the integrity of the train's physical structure. There are no shifts that would suggest post-edit structural mishaps.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image remain balanced and stable after editing, with no noticeable shifts caused by the removal and addition of people?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition remains stable after the editing. The removal of people and the addition of the conductor with a flag has not resulted in an imbalance. The visual weight of the conductor atop the train and the scattered crowd at the platform maintain a balanced focus on the train moving forward, which aligns with the overall theme and dynamic of the original image. The integrity of the scene is preserved.",
