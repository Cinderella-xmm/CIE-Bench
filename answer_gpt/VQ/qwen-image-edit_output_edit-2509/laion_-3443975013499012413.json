      "question": "Do the crystal facets on the fish's body follow the natural curves and scale patterns of the original wooden carving without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fish sculpture is made of crystal with sharp, geometric facets, which indicates a significant modification in style from Image A. The wooden carving in Image A depicts a fish with natural curves typical of a woodcut relief. The crystal facets in Image B do not maintain the natural curves or the organic scale pattern seen in wood carvings. Instead, the fish is portrayed with prismatic surfaces that inherently involve geometric distortion. This shows the designer's intention to prioritize a modern, abstract aesthetic over a direct representation of natural forms.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy surfaces of the crystal fish uniformly reflective and free from abrupt texture changes or matte patches that break the illusion of fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal fish in Image B appears to have a uniform, glossy surface. The entire object is constructed with transparent crystal facets that reflect light in a consistent manner, maintaining a sense of fluidity throughout the sculpture. There are no visible matte patches or abrupt texture changes that would disrupt the overall reflective quality of the piece, thus supporting the creation of an even and continuous appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spiral shape of the fish preserved in the crystal version, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a fish with a pronounced spiral shape, similar to the curved design of Image A's wooden fish carving. Despite the change in material and geometric form, the spiral shape is maintained. The segments, although different in visual texture from the wooden version due to the crystal's faceted nature, are consistent and aligned, preserving the dynamic, circular motion intended in both versions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mirrored pedestal beneath the crystal fish reflect the sculpture accurately, with no visible distortions or missing reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a highly polished, reflective pedestal that mirrors the fish sculpture above it. The reflection in the pedestal accurately represents the sculpture, including the intricate facets and colors, without any visible distortions or omissions. The mirrored surface ensures that the fish is represented consistently, supporting the visual illusion of completeness and providing a coherent reflection of the piece.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures clearly preserved in the crystal version without fading or smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal fish in Image B is characterized by prismatic facets rather than the finer, more detailed textures seen in the wooden carving of Image A. The nature of the crystal material emphasizes a sleek, geometric design rather than detailed anatomical features. Consequently, details like gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures are less pronounced or altogether absent, as the focus is on the overall form and faceted design. Thus, Image B does not preserve the subtle textural details found in Image A.",
