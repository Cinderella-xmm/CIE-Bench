      "question": "Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the tea canister exhibits a cylindrical shape with engraved dragon motifs. The engravings smoothly cover the surface, suggesting an adaptation of the original design onto a different shape without distortion. In Image A, the dragon engavings are on a rounded teapot, which may lead to different proportions. Recasting cylindrical and spherical exaggerations suggests common artistic manipulations rather than reliable proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap fits neatly onto the cylindrical canister, showing leaf embossing consistent with embossing technique that expresses smoothness. This texture matches the sheen of canister, suggesting high-quality integration. Common ingenuity on surface continuity in industrial designs portrays cohensive metallic consistency-even when the texture suggests man-made utility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Dragon's Delight' is shown along the spout of the tea canister. It is legible and smoothly aligned along the curve, with even letter spacing and no alteration of metal texture or shading. Implementing proper typography manipulation and understanding natural text rendering on curved surfaces make distortion unlikely.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a tea leaf logo centered atop the cap with clean lines and consistent depth, appearing free from visual imperfections. Precise illustration and knowledge of vector art support a flawless design aspect. Attention to uniform depth concerning light display confirms a cohesive digital rendering appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows dragon engravings consistently across the cylinder surface, free from gaps or warping. Although original Image A portrays spherical engravings, the horizontal alignment of Image B suggests conversion adaptation without deffirmed proportions. The clarity of Image B suggests an alternative arrangement supporting visual cohesion.",
