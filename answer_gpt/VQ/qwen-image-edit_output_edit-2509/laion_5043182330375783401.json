    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes applied to the suit clearly defined, aligned with the contours of the body, and free from jagged or broken edges that disrupt the figure’s natural posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit is depicted with geometric shapes that are sharp and well-defined. They smoothly follow the contours of the body, maintaining natural alignment with the posture of the seated figure. There are no jagged or broken edges, which would disrupt the coherence of the figure's posture, indicating precise and careful application of shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chair retain a stable, grounded structure with symmetrical, flowing patterns that align with the figure’s seated position and do not appear to float or tilt unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a chair with a clear and defined structure. The patterns are symmetrical and align properly with the seated position of the figure. There is no indication of floating or unnatural tilting, which suggests the chair is well-constructed to support the figure stably.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sunset gradient in the background smooth and continuous, with no abrupt color shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a sunset gradient that transitions smoothly and continuously between colors. There are no abrupt shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure, which demonstrates a well-executed and harmonious color gradient consistent with a natural sunset effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and blue areas of the suit show coherent highlights and reflections that follow a single light source and avoid repeating textures or unnatural glossiness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's suit displays metallic silver and blue areas that show coherent highlights and reflections. These areas suggest the presence of a single, consistent light source, without unnatural glossiness or repeating textures, giving the suit a realistic metallic sheen.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand on the chair have five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and are the joints and knuckles proportionally accurate and not distorted by stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand on the chair is depicted with five distinct fingers. The spacing between the fingers is natural, and the curvature reflects a realistic posture. The joints and knuckles are proportionally accurate and free from distortion due to stylization, maintaining anatomical correctness.",
