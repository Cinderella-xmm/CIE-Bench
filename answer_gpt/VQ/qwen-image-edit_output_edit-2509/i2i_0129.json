      "question": "Does the giant manta ray seamlessly replace the surfboard, maintaining the surfer’s pose without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giant manta ray has replaced the space previously occupied by the surfboard. The surfer's pose seems to be flowing naturally with the body's movement. By observing the interaction between the surfer’s feet and the manta ray, there is no visible unnatural distortion or misalignment, which indicates that the integration has been done seamlessly. The surfer's pose remains consistent and believable, suggesting a smooth transition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the dreamy atmosphere effects been integrated smoothly, enhancing the image without creating unnatural artifacts or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a dreamy, surreal atmosphere, enhanced by lighting effects and color tone adjustments that give a magical and captivating look. The atmosphere, along with the light reflections and shading on the manta ray, appears smooth and cohesive with the rest of the image. There are no evident breaks or unnatural artifacts, and the details in the water and animal have been preserved, indicating successful integration of these effects.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interaction between the manta ray and the waves visually credible, avoiding any apparent breaks in texture or geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interaction between the giant manta ray and the ocean waves is critical to maintaining visual credibility. The wave splash and the placement of the manta ray appear naturally integrated with the surrounding water. The splashing and the textural flow between the manta ray and the wave are aligned and show no obvious breaks or mismatches, thus suggesting a visually believable interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the size and shape of the manta ray align naturally with the scale of the surfboard and surfer, avoiding disproportionate or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the size of the manta ray as compared to the surfer, the scale seems intentionally exaggerated to create a surreal effect. Despite the fantasy-like scenario, the composition maintains a balance between the manta ray's enormity and the size of the surfer, ensuring that the unrealistic scaling remains artistically acceptable rather than awkwardly disproportionate within the context of the image’s theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and edges of the manta ray free of visible artifacts, maintaining smooth transitions and natural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The manta ray in Image B presents smooth textural transitions and carefully maintained details across its surfaces, including the fins, body, and face. Its edges blend well with the background and water without showing noticeable artifacts or pixelation, indicating a high-quality editing process.",
