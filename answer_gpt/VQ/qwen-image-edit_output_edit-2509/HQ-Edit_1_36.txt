    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elderâ€™s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
    "explanation": "The second image displays cartoon illustrations of an elder in various outfits, including the hanbok. The facial features are stylized and blurred for anonymization. Cartoons or illustrations typically smooth out textures for artistic representation, which can eliminate realistic skin features such as wrinkles. Thus, the illustration inherently applies smoothing and distortion common to cartoon styles.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the floral patterns on the hanbok and surrounding foliage display consistent detail and alignment without visible repetition or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the floral patterns on the hanbok and foliage are designed in a typical cartoon style. The details are simplified yet consistent across the different cards. Illustration styles often limit detail intentionally for aesthetic or thematic purposes, which explains the simplified yet consistent appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the green vine accents positioned behind the subject and aligned with the depth of the background, without appearing to float above or through solid structures?",
    "explanation": "The edited image includes green vine decorations positioned around the floral frame of the cards. The vine elements are well-integrated into the background decoration in a flat cartoon manner, consistent with the overal stylized depiction, and do not appear to float or intersect incorrectly with other elements.",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the envelope frame fully aligned with the image boundaries, with no jagged edges, clipping errors, or mismatched shadowing?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image featuring an envelope layout alongside cards, the envelope is well-placed with clear, defined edges following a neat design. Jagged edges, clipping, or shadow mismatches are not evident, keeping with the intentional clean and cohesive design of illustrations.",
