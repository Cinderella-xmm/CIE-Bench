    "Question": "Q1: Do the superhero costumes on all five individuals have consistent fabric textures and realistic draping that follow the contours of their bodies without unnatural stretching or folding?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the superhero costumes are characterized by a smooth, more cartoon-like appearance typical of comic book styles. The fabric textures are simplistic and vivid, focusing on bright colors rather than realistic textures such as stretch or fold dynamics. This style choice aligns with typical superhero costume illustrations in comic books, where the focus is on stylized design rather than realistic fabric behavior.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are illustrated in a stylized manner typical of comic book art. Some fingers aren't distinctly visible due to the hand positioning and the style choice, which doesn't focus on intricate hand detail. Typically in comic art, grips are suggested rather than explicitly detailed, which can result in fewer visible fingers.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the superhero-style poses are exaggerated for dramatic effect, which is common in comic illustrations. This results in some poses that may not be entirely anatomically correct, such as more rigid limb positions or exaggerated stances that suit the superhero theme but may not reflect natural human posture.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the dialogue bubbles positioned above or near the heads of the individuals without overlapping eyes or mouths, and do they display legible text with clean edges and no visual artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dialogue bubbles are well-positioned above the characters, in keeping with comic conventions. They do not overlap eyes or mouths, which maintains clear character visibility. The text in the bubbles appears comic-stylized but legible, and the edges are clean without visual artifacts, consistent with professional comic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the enhanced garden background visually coherent with the original scene, featuring consistent lighting, natural flower arrangements, and no abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the garden background is stylized to match a comic book aesthetic. While it retains the essence of a garden scene with trees and flowers, the style is more vibrant and cartoonish, lacking the natural texture and lighting found in the original scene. The colors are more saturated, which is typical for a comic rendition, thus creating a departure from naturalism.",
    "answer": "No"
