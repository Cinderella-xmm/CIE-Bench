      "question": "Is the glass cloche added over the pottery setup transparent, smoothly shaped, and free of visible artifacts such as jagged edges or distorted reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cloche appears to be smoothly shaped with no visible artifacts like jagged edges or distorted reflections. The transparency of the glass allows the pottery setup inside to be viewed clearly. Common visual characteristics of a well-made glass cloche include a smooth and clear surface, which this cloche exhibits.",

      "question": "Do the clay pieces exhibit a uniform, realistic patina that blends naturally with their original gray tone without abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clay pieces now have a turquoise patina that covers them uniformly. The color transition from the original gray to turquoise appears smooth and consistent, giving a realistic appearance of aged ceramic, which typically develops a patina over time. There are no abrupt color shifts or highlights; the finish is even.",

      "question": "Are the miniature fairies proportionally scaled to the pottery and tools, positioned realistically on or near the table, and anatomically accurate with intact limbs and natural poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fairies in Image B are proportionally scaled to fit the miniature setting with the pottery and tools. They are positioned at the base of the table, which is a realistic interaction with their environment. The fairies possess anatomically accurate features and display natural poses with intact limbs, enhancing the scene's authenticity.",

      "question": "Are the moss and tiny flowers placed along the edges of the wooden table with natural growth patterns and realistic textures, without covering critical structural components or appearing artificially pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss and tiny flowers are placed at the base of the wooden structure, creating a naturalistic environment. The arrangement respects the structure's layout and does not obscure key elements, such as the table legs. The texture and placement look organic and not forced, contributing to a realistic setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden plaque seen in Image B is firmly attached to the base with respect to size and positioning. The plaque appears to fit well with the overall display, and the engraving is clear and readable. The plaque surface looks smooth, free of warping or unusual textures, which is typical of well-crafted plaques.",
