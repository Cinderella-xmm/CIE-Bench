      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine of the elephant retain the natural grass-eating pose without introducing unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a chibi-style figurine of an elephant inside a glass dome, holding grass in its trunk as if eating it. This pose mirrors natural behavior, as elephants commonly use their trunks to eat grass. The artistic style of a chibi figurine generally involves some degree of exaggerated and cute proportions, yet the basic action of eating remains feasible and realistic within this creative context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the elephant's skin in the figurine realistic, showing natural details without appearing overly smooth or artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine has a chibi-style representation, which tends to simplify details to focus on cuteness. However, analyzing the texture reveals that while it does not have the deep wrinkles of a real elephant's skin, it still includes some surface detailing to suggest the texture of an elephant. In this context, the texture does not appear overly smooth or artificial, as such simplification is typical and expected in this style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base design mimic a muddy terrain naturally and complement the elephant figurine without creating visible gaps or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base design of the figurine is illustrative of a muddy terrain, with some blades of grass shown, creating a coherent environment for the elephant. The transitions between the base, the elephant, and the grass seem smooth and intentional, typical in models where the environment complements the figure without visible gaps.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transparent acrylic dome over the figurine clear and does it not cause distracting reflections or distortions on the figurine or the surrounding base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome covering the figurine appears to be clear, with only minor light reflections that are commonly seen in clear acrylic coverings. These reflections do not obscure the visibility of the figurine and the base, allowing an unobstructed view and maintaining an overall clarity without causing any noticeable distortions or distractions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no noticeable artifacts, such as missing components or misplaced shadows, that disrupt the visual plausibility of the figurine scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of the figurine scene, there are no obvious artifacts or missing components. The figurine, base, and dome appear to be well-integrated within a cohesive scene, with shadows and lighting consistent and logical within the world of the small diorama. This setup suggests a carefully crafted presentation without technical errors.",
