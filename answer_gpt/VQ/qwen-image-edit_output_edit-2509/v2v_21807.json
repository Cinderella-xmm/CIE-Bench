      "question": "Are the clock faces and architectural details of the tower clearly visible and structurally consistent despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces on the tower are visible and maintain a consistent structure in line with the cartoon style, featuring clear Roman numerals and clock hands. The architectural details, like the spire and the ornamental pillars, retain their fundamental shapes, albeit simplified for a cartoon aesthetic. This indicates a successful translation of structural details into the cartoon medium without losing consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding elements retain their natural textures without any noticeable loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style inherently simplifies textures to flat colors and bold lines. Thus, the natural stone texture seen in Image A is transformed into a smooth, uniform color in Image B. This is typical for cartoons, which do not replicate natural textures, resulting in a noticeable loss of detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image avoid introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions in the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon style of Image B does not introduce any artifacts or distortions outside of its stylistic intent. The lines are clean, and the shapes are consistent with a simplified, cartoonish portrayal. Everything portrayed remains logical within this style choice, avoiding unintended visual artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the clock tower and its surroundings logically maintained in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the clock tower and the surrounding cars and trees are maintained similarly to Image A, preserving logical physical relationships. Despite the reduced detailing, the overall spatial arrangement and scale feel coherent within the cartoon depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the clock tower and its surroundings remain intact and undistorted in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves the geometric integrity of the clock tower and its surroundings. The cartoon style employs clear, crisp lines to represent the architectural structure and surrounding elements without distortion. The geometric forms remain faithful to their original counterparts in terms of shape and structure.",
