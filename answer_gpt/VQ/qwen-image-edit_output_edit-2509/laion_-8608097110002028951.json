      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the facade of the theater building appear composed of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents, without visible seams, irregular patterns, or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facade shows a consistent texture typical of LEGO bricks, where the tan color is uniformly distributed, allowing for the typical clean and smooth finish often found in LEGO structures. The brown accents are also in line with LEGO stylization, giving it a cohesive look. There are no seams or irregular patterns visible, which aligns with the expectation from LEGO constructions having uniformly interlocking parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes that preserve the arch shape but feature a regular grid pattern, without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the windows using translucent LEGO-style panes that fit within the arch framework, adhering to a grid pattern typical of LEGO designs. These panes are organized in a manner similar to LEGO's thinkbricks and studs, maintaining uniformity and spatial consistency without distortion or misalignment, successfully preserving the original shape and pattern.",

      "question": "Do the \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" signs show letters constructed from smooth red flat LEGO bricks, maintaining legibility and alignment with the awning structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the signs appear made of LEGO bricks, specifically depicting a flat red surface, typical in LEGO design when representing signage or lettering. The legibility is maintained through the use of LEGOâ€™s sleek design conventions, allowing for easy identification and alignment along the awning structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles with simplified shapes, including rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces, without retaining realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two cars crafted in a simplified LEGO form, characterized by rectangular bodies and circular wheels - hallmarks of LEGO design. The absence of more complex design features like curved fenders or chrome trims is consistent with the simplified, stylized approach typical of LEGO models, adhering to blocky shapes and flat surfaces.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-style cars and building maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment, with no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an environment where the cars and building appear integrated within the scene appropriately scaled relative to each other and the architectural context. There are no visible floating parts or misaligned elements within the LEGO construction approach, indicating precise alignment and spacing suitable within the stylized LEGO theme.",
