      "question": "Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur on the side of the cat is illustrated with lines that give a textured appearance, similar to the fur on the front, maintaining consistency. The fur was drawn in a way that represents the natural direction and growth of feline fur. Through visual observation, there are no visible artifacts or discrepancies, showing a harmonious texture overall.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has been drawn with the cat's profile view, where the front and side are placed in alignment within a smoothly rendered figure. The illustration's proportional design follows the natural anatomy of a cat, ensuring that the views align correctly with no distortion and without overlapping artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes and ears are depicted with clear outlines and smooth features that preserve the realistic shape and characteristic details. Unlike a photograph where blurring might occur, an illustration clearly maintains sharpness and definition without artifacts, ensuring the natural appearance of the catâ€™s facial features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a single side view of the cat lying down where the transition between its front and side is consistent and continuous in its geometric representation. The illustration is carefully executed to avoid broken shapes or awkward intersections typically found in less coherent edits.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the cat in Image B is naturally depicted in a lying position, reflective of typical feline behavior with limbs proportionally drawn and positioned naturally. There is no indication of unnatural bending or stretching, which suggests the design of the image follows a plausible anatomical structure.",
