      "question": "Are the sunglasses on the horse's face free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses on the horse appear smooth and well-integrated into the image. They are depicted being shiny with a chain, typical of aviator-style glasses. Based on visual cues, the glasses do not show any signs of pixelation, misalignment, or other unnatural textures that would detract from their natural appearance.",

      "question": "Does the horse's facial structure maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the addition of sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's facial structure appears well-proportioned, and the addition of sunglasses does not distort its natural appearance. The placement of the sunglasses on the horse's face is anatomically consistent, with the glasses resting typically where they might in real life. These visual observations, combined with world knowledge of horse anatomy, suggest that the structural consistency is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horse's fur texture and details preserved without any loss or unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the horseâ€™s fur around the sunglasses seems well-maintained. There are no visible distortions or unnatural artifacts affecting the fur texture, such as blurring or incorrect shading. The details are appropriately depicted near the glasses and maintain realism, suggesting that the sunglasses were added without degrading the fur texture.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sunglasses' material and reflections appear realistic and consistent with the lighting conditions of the sunset scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents sunglasses that have an appropriate sheen and minor reflections consistent with metallic material. Considering the sunset scene, this metallic finish aligns well with the lighting, as this material could capture subtle reflections and glows from the sunset. The realism in the representation of these lighting effects supports a visually credible depiction.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse's eyes visible and undistorted under the sunglasses, preserving their natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't visibly depict the horse's eyes through the sunglasses, indicating that their appearance might be obscured. The sunglasses are typical aviator glasses, which often obscure visibility to both observers and the wearer, thus likely preventing a clear view of the horse's eyes. Given the absence of visible eye detail, assessing distortion is challenging, though structurally their positioning suggests no misplacement.",
