    "Question": "Q1: Do the extended page edges blend naturally into the frame without introducing any unnatural breaks or abrupt transitions at the corners?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the extended page edges need a seamless integration with the overall frame to maintain realism. The visual cues suggest a smooth transition from the pages to the frame, without any noticeable breaks or awkward joins. This blend can be analyzed by checking the curvature and alignment consistency with the rest of the book pages. Based on the visual evidence, the page edges indeed blend without causing visual disruptions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the curved shadow cast by the extended pages follow the lighting direction present in the original image, contributing to a natural perception of depth?",
    "explanation": "The lighting direction in Image B appears similar to the original image with the shadow falling on the table. The shadow cast by the extended pages aligns well with this lighting direction, creating a realistic depth effect. Shadows in edited images must follow the prevailing light source for believability, and here, it seems to conform to expectations without any inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the texture and fine details of the extended pages consistent with the original pages, with no visible loss or distortion of the text and paper grain?",
    "explanation": "The texture and details of the pages in Image B should mirror those in the original image to maintain authenticity. The visual review indicates that the extended pages retain clear textual detail and paper texture without noticeable distortion or inconsistency. This consistency is crucial for preserving the image's credibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the curvature of the extended pages consistent with the perspective of the original image, creating a believable unfolding effect without distorting the geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The curvature of the pages in Image B should match the perspective seen in the original image to create a cohesive unfolding effect. The visual investigation reveals that the extended pages maintain consistent geometric shapes and curvature, in line with the expected perspective, resulting in a believable unfolding effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the interaction between the base of the book and the wooden table appear natural, with no unrealistic gaps or overlaps introduced by the extension of the pages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, examining the interaction between the book's base and the wooden table is key to assessing realism. The extended pages should naturally sit upon the table surface without creating visible gaps or overlap errors. Observing these cues, the base of the book integrates well with the table, harmonizing with the physical setup of the original setup without any unrealistic artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
