      "question": "Are the iridescent wings attached to the spider’s thorax symmetrically and do they display smooth, continuous mosaic-like patterns without jagged edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analysis shows that the wings emanating from the spider's thorax appear to be symmetrically positioned on both sides, reflecting an even extension from the central point where they attach. The mosaic-like patterns on the wings are vivid and consistent, showing smooth continuity without any apparent jagged edges or abrupt breaks. This symmetry and pattern continuity align with the usual characteristics of well-crafted wing designs in artistic illustrations. Therefore, the conclusion based on these visual cues supports that the wings are symmetrically attached and display smooth patterns.",

      "question": "Is the luminous orb positioned where the original abdomen was, and does it maintain proportional size and alignment with the spider’s body without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the luminous orb shows it positioned at the location where the spider's abdomen typically resides and appears to occupy the space with appropriate size and alignment. The orb seems naturally integrated with the body structure of the spider, following the contours of its design without suggesting detachment or misalignment. This observation indicates careful adherence to proportionality and placement, consistent with typical orb installations in artistic renderings. Therefore, the orb does indeed maintain proportionality and alignment with the spider’s body.",

      "question": "Do the golden filigree spirals wrap around each leg segment smoothly, following the natural bends and joints without breaking or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the golden filigree spirals are depicted wrapping around the spider's leg segments with precision. The spirals follow the natural contours and bends of the legs, adhering closely to the joint structures without visible breaks or incorrect overlaps. This meticulous detail in the wrapping pattern ensures a seamless incorporation into the spider's anatomy. The observation aligns with the common practices of detailed artwork, where attention to continuity and flow in patterns is paramount. Thus, the filigree spirals are applied smoothly around the leg segments.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fangs now thin, translucent, and needle-shaped, extending naturally from the spider’s mouth area without appearing misshapen or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider's fangs are transformed into thin, translucent structures, resembling needle-like shapes that extend naturally from the mouth region. The fangs retain a linear, pointed form that suggests they are physical extensions of the spider's anatomy without appearing distorted or disconnected from the mouth. Such characteristics are often used to depict ethereal or delicate features in art, contributing to a cohesive aesthetic. Therefore, the fangs are indeed depicted as thin, translucent, needle-shaped extensions from the mouth.",

      "question": "Does the ethereal aura surround the spider uniformly, fading gently into the background without visible streaks, sharp edges, or interference with nearby leaves or web strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the ethereal aura is shown enveloping the spider in a uniform manner, with a soft fade into the background. The aura maintains a consistent, gentle gradient that dissolves without harsh lines or streaks. Furthermore, the aura does not interfere with nearby elements like leaves or web strands, allowing those details to remain unaffected by its presence. This smooth transition and lack of interference are characteristic of well-rendered mystical elements in illustrations. As a result, the aura does indeed surround the spider uniformly and fades gently into the background.",
