      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we have to infer from the rest of the visible parts. The neck and shoulders exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns and maintain accurate proportions without distortions. Considering this, it is reasonable to assume the same level of quality and consistency for the facial area despite the blur.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing rendered as deeply incised carvings with visible relief depth, and do they preserve the original arrangement of colors and shapes without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing patterns are deeply incised carvings with visible relief depth, accurately preserving the original arrangement of colors and shapes from Image A. The vibrant colors are well defined and no misalignment or blurring is present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the beads on the crown and earrings clearly defined with vibrant, non-blended colors, appearing as painted details on the wooden surface rather than merged or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the crown and earrings are clearly defined with vibrant, non-blended colors. They appear as painted details on the wooden surface, matching the arrangement and color vibrancy seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of low-relief carved plant forms that maintain spatial depth and botanical structure, without flattening or losing the sense of layered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is made of a carved surface filled with hieroglyphs rather than plant forms, indicating a transformation from a botanical setting in Image A to an Egyptian-inspired backdrop in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the entire sculpture surface display a consistent polished finish with no visible rendering artifacts, such as edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, or clothing carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a consistent polished finish across the wooden sculpture surface, without any visible rendering artifacts like edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, or clothing carvings. The details are well-defined and the transition from different materials appears smooth.",
