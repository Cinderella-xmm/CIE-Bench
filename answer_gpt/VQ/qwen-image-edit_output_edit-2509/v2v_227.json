      "question": "Do the simplified versions of the red motorcycle and blue truck maintain their key features without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red motorcycle and blue truck are presented in a simplified, cartoon style. The motorcycle features are retained such as its red color and overall shape, and the truck maintains its boxy structure and blue color. These simplifications do not introduce unnatural textures or distortions. The designs are purposely abstracted while still recognizable, a common approach in stylized illustrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rider's black gear appears in a stylized cartoon form with smooth textures and simplified shapes, typical of cartoon illustrations.

      "question": "Are the playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics added without breaking the visual credibility or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the playful touches like the exaggerated proportions of the motorcycle and truck, contribute to a stylized and dynamic appearance. The designs retain visual credibility as they clearly convey the intended forms without artifacts. Such choices are typical in cartoon representations, where expressive characteristics enhance the portrayal without undermining visual integrity.",

      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a thick white outline around the sticker's circular base which encapsulates the cartoon motorcycle and truck. This outline is consistent and does not hinder the clarity of the depicted elements inside. In sticker art, outer outlines typically serve to separate the main illustrations from the background, which is achieved effectively here.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the use of a solid flat color for the circular base, with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it, achieve a dynamic effect without causing visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a solid flat blue color as the circular base. Both the motorcycle and truck extend slightly beyond it, creating a dynamic effect that enhances the design. The extension does not lead to visual inconsistencies or a loss of fine details, prevalent in cartoon art to capture attention.",
