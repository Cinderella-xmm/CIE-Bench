      "question": "Does the kimono feature bold, clean outlines and uniformly flat color regions without gradient blending or photographic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is depicted with bold outlines and regions of flat color, characteristic of traditional Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e). The colors are applied uniformly across these regions, lacking any gradient blending or photographic texture, which is consistent with the stylized art form. This approach simplifies the visual representation, focusing on pattern and color rather than realistic texture.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cherry blossoms as simplified shapes with muted pink hues.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path stones and vertical poles are depicted in a manner consistent with woodblock printing techniques. They show textured patterns such as hatching or stippling that give the impression of depth and grain without employing realistic shadowing or texturing, reminiscent of traditional printmaking methods.",
