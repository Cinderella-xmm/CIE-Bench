    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's body is made of LEGO bricks, with distinct patterning that is typical of LEGO sets. The bricks show clear definition and alignment, without texture inconsistencies, as common with LEGO constructions where bricks are designed for uniform size and shape. The visual cues in Image B resemble these characteristics, hence supporting the conclusion that the truck's body is correctly composed of LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels of the truck are LEGO-style pieces, identifiable by their distinctive round shape and designed for smooth connections in LEGO builds. There is no visible deformation in the wheels, and they appear to have proper proportions characteristic of LEGO constructions. Given the solid geometric structure and the absence of jagged or distorted shapes visible in Image B, the wheels are correctly presented as circular LEGO-style pieces.",

      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed appears to be represented using LEGO bricks. However, upon close observation, there is a lack of a regular grid pattern typical of flat LEGO tiles, with some visible misalignments and inconsistencies in coverage. The area does not exemplify a fully smooth and flat LEGO tile arrangement. Therefore, based on world knowledge and the visual cues in Image B, it does not fully match the description of a smoothly tiled truck bed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is placed on a white shelf that extends beneath its full width, providing a stable base without any apparent gaps around the truck's footprint. The shelf under the truck offers solidity, supporting the conclusion that the truck is positioned securely. Visual cues suggest no floating effects, touching the shelf appropriately, aligning with common stability features seen in model displays.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck's tailgate, side steps, and bumpers are modeled using LEGO bricks. While the truck is recognizable as a LEGO version, there are discrepancies in the proportions or alignment compared to a realistic truck model. Some components may not fully align or maintain proportions in LEGO form due to inherent limitations in brick shapes and sizes. Based on the visual evaluation, these parts do not strictly adhere to accurate proportions or complete alignment, considering the constraints of LEGO build accuracy.",
