      "question": "Does the hammer's handle display a uniform deep blue enamel surface with no visible cracks, rough patches, or color variations, and does the head show realistic metallic sheen with consistent reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle of the hammer is deep blue and shows a smooth, uniform enamel surface without any visible imperfections like cracks or rough patches. The head of the hammer displays a realistic metallic sheen, characterized by consistent reflections and a polished appearance. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that enamel surfaces are designed to be uniform and blemish-free, and the visual cues in the image support the description provided, as the hammer's head appears shiny and reflective.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers retain their original shapes and proportions, with smooth, reflective enamel surfaces and no warped edges, missing details, or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers appear to maintain their original shapes, as their proportions are consistent with typical hand tools. The visual appearance showcases smooth, reflective enamel surfaces, suggesting a polished finish. The lack of warped edges, missing details, or inconsistent material transitions supports the idea that these tools are well-crafted and that the enamel coating has been applied evenly. World knowledge tells us that high-quality enamel finishes aim to achieve smooth, uniform coatings, confirmed by the visual properties in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enamel shavings shaped into natural-looking curls with varied thickness and smooth, glossy surfaces, avoiding flat or rigid appearances and maintaining fine detail along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The enamel shavings in Image B portray natural-looking curls, with each piece displaying varied thickness reminiscent of real shavings. Their surfaces appear smooth and glossy, indicating a well-applied enamel finish. No parts seem flat or rigid, as each shaving maintains the detailed edges expected from curled shavings. The conclusion is based on the observation of diverse curl shapes and consistent surface reflections typical for enamel materials.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric background show a natural weave texture with soft folds and slight color variation, and does it provide a visually coherent base for the enamel tools without appearing artificial or overly smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The linen fabric background in Image B demonstrates a natural weave texture, observable through the small textile patterns and subtle folds. There are slight variations in color, contributing to a realistic fabric impression. It serves as a coherent and authentic base for the enamel tools, avoiding any overly smooth or artificial appearance. This is evident from the visible texture that aligns with the expectations of natural linen material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the enamel tools consistent with a single light source and the reflective nature of enamel, and do all tools rest naturally on the fabric without gaps, floating effects, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights on each tool are consistent with the effects expected from a single light source, illustrating the reflective characteristics of the enamel. The reflections throughout the tools are uniform and coherent, following the same light direction. Additionally, the tools rest naturally on the fabric surface without any observed gaps or floating effects. They appear aligned correctly with the fabric, supporting the impression of realism through accurate shadow placement and tactile interaction with the surface below.",
