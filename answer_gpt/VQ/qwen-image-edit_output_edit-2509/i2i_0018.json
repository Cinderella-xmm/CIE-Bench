      "question": "Does the exaggerated and elongated clock tower retain its structural consistency and does it appear logically consistent with the original proportions of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower has been transformed into a stylized, cartoon-like representation, often seen in souvenir badges and pins. These types of representations often exaggerate features and may not strictly adhere to the original proportions for stylistic effect. The tower in Image B is elongated, deviating from typical architectural proportions to create a playful, attention-catching design. When compared to Image A, the tower in Image B does not retain structural consistency with real-life proportions, although it is coherent within the contextual logic of a chibi rendition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colorful geometric flowerbed rings natural in appearance, lacking any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowerbeds are replaced with colorful geometric patterns, which resemble stylized enamel designs typical of badges. These patterns are part of a design aesthetic that uses bright, solid colors and simplified shapes. The goal is not to replicate natural textures, but to create an attractive pattern that is coherent with a collectible or decorative badge. Therefore, while the appearance is not natural in the sense of mimicking real flowers, it is intentional and appropriate within the enamel badge context.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition from the chibi-style illustration elements to the glossy enamel coloring look smooth and free of visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from chibi illustration elements to enamel-like coloring is represented by smooth, solid colors with glossy effects typical of enamel badges. The design employs continuous lines and solid color fills, which contribute to a polished, artifact-free presentation. These characteristics are indicative of quality manufacturing in enamel products, where any visible artifact would be considered a flaw.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the clock tower and flowerbed badge maintain a vertical, metallic structure consistent with a city souvenir badge, without any structural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a stylized depiction of the clock tower and flowerbed as a badge. The vertical structure is consistent within the design parameters of a badge, which often simplifies and exaggerates certain elements for artistic effect. The badge maintains a coherent and intended structure without unintentional distortions. The materials and appearance suggest a metallic badge, characterized by the outlined design and uniform color fields.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style transformation of the clock tower and flowerbed retain a natural and authentic appearance, avoiding any obvious distortions or unrealistic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a chibi-style transformation, commonly characterized by playful, exaggerated features, which may not adhere to natural realism. This approach intentionally introduces elements that might seem unrealistic in a traditional sense but are typical in stylized art forms. The transformation results in an appearance consistent with art styles meant to evoke charm and collectibility rather than strict authenticity. Therefore, while it does not mirror reality, it avoids unintended distortions and maintains artistic coherence.",
