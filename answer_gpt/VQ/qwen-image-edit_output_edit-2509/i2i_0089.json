      "question": "Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten appears to be in a dynamic pose, as if jumping out towards the viewer. The body structure, including the head, torso, legs, and tail, looks proportionate and natural. There are no visible distortions or artifacts that detract from the overall natural shape of the kitten's body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fur details around the kittenâ€™s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten's face in Image B shows detailed fur texture, especially around the ears and cheeks. The fur appears realistic, with a soft and fine appearance typical of a kitten, and there is no evidence of unnatural textures or blurred details that would suggest a deterioration in image quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten in Image B is depicted with a sense of motion, stepping forward as if coming out of the frame. The perspective and proportions align well with what one would expect from such a dynamic pose. The limbs appear proportional, and there are no distortions that would suggest a break in the simulated 3D effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue blanket in Image B appears textured and realistically rendered, with natural folds and shadows that contribute to the depth and 3D effect. There are no apparent artifacts or unnatural modifications visible, and the blanket enhances the overall 3D visual without detracting from it.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's paws are depicted in a forward-reaching pose that fits the theme of the 3D jump-out effect. The shapes of the paws are natural and consistent with the anatomy of a kitten without any visible distortions or deformations. They contribute effectively to the sense of motion without undermining the kitten's realistic appearance.",
