      "question": "Do the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear of the chibi-style skiers appear consistent with the original design and maintain their structural integrity without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style skiers are wearing outfits, backpacks, and using skiing gear that are visually consistent with typical winter skiing attire. The structural integrity is preserved, as the skis, poles, backpacks, and clothing retain their expected shapes and sizes. Compared to Image A, the elements in Image B maintain the same general design and structure, confirming that the edit maintains the original elements without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the skiers' outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear preserved well, without any noticeable loss or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual style of the skiers has changed to a chibi or simplified cartoon style, where textures are naturally less detailed. However, this is a stylistic choice consistent with that type of design, not indicative of distortion or artifacts. While the texture detail is lower compared to Image A, the change is intentional and does not violate design principles of the chibi style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snowy forest setting and the arrangement of environmental elements like trees and snow remain authentic and undistorted, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowy forest setting in Image B matches the atmosphere and arrangement seen in Image A. The trees and snow appear undistorted and maintain their natural appearance, despite the edit to a more simplified character style. The environmental elements retain their integrity and contribute to a realistic backdrop suited for winter skiing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style skiers' bodies relative to their surroundings physically rational and free from any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style is characterized by exaggerated proportions, such as larger heads and smaller bodies, yet this is consistent within its own design principles and intentional for stylistic purposes. In Image B, these proportions do not show geometric distortions that would be considered errors; they adhere to the chibi aesthetic. They contrast with Image A, which displays typical human anatomy, but within their respective contexts, both maintain proportional rationality.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the skiers, the snowy path, and the surrounding forest, maintain visual credibility without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images feature a similar composition: two skiers moving down a snowy path flanked by trees. Image B maintains this composition effectively, with the chibi-style adding an artistic flair while keeping the fundamental elements consistent. There are no inconsistencies in the layout or composition when juxtaposed with the original; the edited version offers a harmonious and cohesive visual experience.",
