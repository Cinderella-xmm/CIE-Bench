    "Question": "Q1: Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",
    "Explanation": "To evaluate the mosaic pattern on the saree, I will first identify the visual elements that define mosaic tesserae such as size, alignment, and absence of distortion. The saree's pattern appears to be uniformly distributed with consistent tesserae size and alignment, similar to traditional mosaics where tiles are neatly arranged. There are no visible seams or distortions in the tile alignment, indicating a meticulous design.",
    "Answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
    "Explanation": "To analyze the structural coherence of the arches and dome, I will consider the symmetry and alignment typical of architectural structures. The transformed building in the image presents arches and domes that maintain straight edges and consistent curvature, with no apparent misalignment or breaks in geometry, showcasing a complete and coherent architectural design.",
    "Answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do both hands show five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and joint alignment, and no extra digits or unnatural bending?",
    "Explanation": "In assessing the hands, I focus on the anatomical accuracy and natural positioning of fingers. Both hands depicted in the image have five fingers each with proper spacing and joint alignment. There aren't any extra digits or unnatural bending visible, ensuring that the hands appear anatomically correct.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral motifs evenly distributed and proportionally sized relative to the surrounding architecture, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "Explanation": "To evaluate the distribution and proportionality of the floral motifs, I consider their placement within the architectural context. The motifs are evenly distributed across the image and proportionally integrated with the surrounding elements, preventing any floating or incorrect overlap and maintaining visual coherence.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the golden backdrop exhibit smooth gradient transitions and subtle surface variations, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine?",
    "Explanation": "For analyzing the golden backdrop, I look at the color transitions and surface texture, typical of depth and richness in mosaic backgrounds. The golden backdrop displays smooth gradient transitions and subtle variations across its surface, avoiding abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine, resulting in a realistic and aesthetically pleasing finish.",
    "Answer": "Yes"
