      "question": "Does the curved glass dome have a smooth, seamless surface without visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions that disrupt the visual continuity of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is depicted as having a smooth and clear surface, with no visible seams or scratches. The visual continuity of the scene inside the dome is not disrupted, indicating a well-crafted dome that maintains uniformity around the enclosed display. The clarity of the glass allows the viewer to see the intricate details of the ship and the birds without any interference or distortion, suggesting seamless workmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit layered, folded paper-like textures with consistent shadows and depth, without geometric distortions or flattened areas that deviate from their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails of the ship appear to have a realistic, layered texture that mimics the qualities of paper or fabric, with noticeable depth and consistent shadows. This gives the sails a structured and three-dimensional appearance, maintaining their natural form. There are no visible flat or distorted regions that would indicate a deviation from their intended shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer below the ship show consistent translucency, internal glow, and wave-like patterns without abrupt transitions or unnatural textures at the hull interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue resin layer in Image B is portrayed with a smooth, consistent translucency and exhibits an internal glow that is reminiscent of water. The wave-like patterns are uniformly distributed and blend seamlessly with the ship's hull. There are no odd textures or abrupt changes at the hull interface that would disrupt the visual harmony, indicating careful rendering of the resin effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls connected by faint, straight wires that do not interfere with their natural flight positions or create visible mechanical supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the seagulls are suspended as if in flight within the dome, there are no visible wires or mechanical supports connecting them. The presentation suggests that they are either ingeniously attached or their support mechanisms are disguised to maintain the natural appearance of flight, keeping the aesthetic integrity of the display intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) correctly positioned and scaled within the glass dome without clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that compromises structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship, its sails, water, and the birds appear to be proportionately scaled and appropriately positioned within the confines of the glass dome. There are no signs of clipping, overlapping, or any misalignment of elements that would detract from the structural coherence of the scene. The arrangement looks intentionally designed to fit naturally within the dome's space.",
