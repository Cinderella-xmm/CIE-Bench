    "Question": "Q1: Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is placed inside a glass dome and appears smaller than in Image A, which could indicate scaling down. Upon examining its form and details such as engravings and structure, they are consistent with Image A, indicating no distortion occurred during scaling. The integrity in shape, details, and proportions suggests a seamless scaling down process.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the porcelain cups are uniformly positioned around the base of the teapot. They exhibit clear reflections and shadows, indicative of a realistic ceramic material. Their arrangement avoids overlapping, contributing to a balanced composition. These visual cues support the notion that they're materially and spatially coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the new engravings on the elevated surface match the existing decorative patterns in style and depth, without appearing pixelated, duplicated, or unnaturally enhanced?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows an elevated surface near the base of the teapot adorned with engravings. These engravings seamlessly integrate with the existing patterns seen on the teapot itself in both images, being consistent in style and depth without distortion, pixelation, or unwanted duplication, indicating a coherent design enhancement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the steam spirals rise smoothly from the teapotâ€™s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft edges, proper translucency, and consistent lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "Steam spirals are visible in Image B, rising from the teapot's spout and lid area. The smooth transition, soft edges, and evident translucency suggest a realistic depiction of steam. The interaction with light maintains consistency, indicating an accurate simulation of steam behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome show accurate light refraction and surface reflections, allowing clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without visual distortion or artificial glare?",
    "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows a glass dome encompassing the teapot. The dome allows clear visibility of its contents, with accurate light refraction and realistic reflections on its surface. There is no visual distortion or artificial glare, suggesting that transparency and clarity are adequately portrayed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
