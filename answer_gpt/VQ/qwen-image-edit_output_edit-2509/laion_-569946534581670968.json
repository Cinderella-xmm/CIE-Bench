      "question": "Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B involves assessing the plush toy versions of chicken wings. These plush wings appear to mimic real chicken wings but, upon closer inspection, the fabric composition and plush texture alter the natural shape and proportions. The joints and wing tips are visible but lack realistic anatomical accuracy, resulting in deformation due to the plush nature and stuffing, which introduces unnatural stretching compared to real chicken wings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowlâ€™s edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bright orange pillow is set on the plate instead of within a bowl, as may be expected based on reference to sauce placement. However, assessing its positioning and shape reveals that it's placed beside the wings, not inside any bowl, hence its size visually intrudes into the space typically reserved for smaller items. Its bulky appearance encroaches on the surrounding space, suggesting scaling issues if indeed intended for a bowl.",

      "question": "Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background surface is a light-colored wooden texture. It visually outlines a smooth, uniform finish as suited for wooden surfaces. However, upon refined examination, the surface lacks distinct natural wood grain patterns, a hallmark of genuine wood, and instead appears uniformly smooth. The texture consistency suggests digital enhancement over real wood grain visibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden-brown fabric mimicking chicken wings is evaluated. The plush nature is evident, which inherently offers a softer texture. However, the surface displays intentional design elements resembling granular textures for visual effect, capturing the look of a crunchy feel found in real food items. Despite this visual mimicry, the tangible softness consistent with textile material confirms a structurally soft composition rather than actual crunchiness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the original sauce in Image A was positioned within a small white bowl on the plate, aligned with surrounding wings. In Image B, the orange pillow has been placed as a replacement in the general vicinity but not adhering to the prior depth or bowl confines. This results in spatial alignment discrepancies, marking it atop the wings rather than embedded within a functional space like the bowl used for sauce.",
