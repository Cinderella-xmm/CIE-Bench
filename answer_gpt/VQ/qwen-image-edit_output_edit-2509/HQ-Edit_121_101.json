      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background architecture maintains proper alignment and perspective, with roof lines and structural components that do not exhibit skewed angles or floating elements. This consistency reflects an accurate representation of traditional architecture that conveys stability and realism.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the embossed leather-bound panel with a uniform texture and seamless integration of stamped elements with the background. There are no visible irregularities, and it provides a consistent depth impression, characteristic of high-quality embossing techniques.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the chain appears to have exactly five fingers with realistic joint curvature and skin texture. The chain is depicted following a continuous, non-intersecting path, maintaining coherence without breaks or detached elements, indicative of meticulous attention to detail.",
