        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features simplified icons of a lifeguard tower and a rescue vehicle. These icons are designed to be minimalistic, characterized by basic shapes and solid colors, which are typical of schematic representations. The lifeguard tower retains its recognizable shape with a distinctive roof and the rescue vehicle features basic car outlines. Such stylized icons do not possess textures by design and focus on essential attributes. Given the purpose of such icons, which is clarity and recognizability without unnecessary detail, the icons do maintain their key features adequately.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Are the minimalist icons integrated seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall visual plausibility and authenticity of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minimalist icons in Image B are embedded into a design context, likely intended for signage or illustration, where simplicity and functionality are prioritized. They are stylized, which matches the context of use typically found in signage. The scene itself, being an abstract design, does not require hyper-realistic elements, allowing the icons to blend naturally into the composition. Therefore, within the scope of their application, these icons do align well with the imagery's intent and aesthetic.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition to minimalist icons in Image B simplifies forms to convey just enough information for recognition while eliminating unnecessary detail that could introduce clutter or visual noise. The icons achieve clarity through the use of solid fills and are devoid of detail that might be superfluous in schematic representations like these. The execution of these icons maintains their intended simplicity and legibility, effectively avoiding any loss of visual quality or introduction of undesirable elements.",
