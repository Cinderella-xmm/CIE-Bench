    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cat’s body exhibit a smooth, flowing mist-like texture with a consistent sky-blue hue that blends naturally without sharp edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is transformed into a billowing cloud-like texture. The smooth transitions and consistent sky-blue color emphasize a natural, mist-like appearance. The absence of sharp edges or pixelation suggests careful editing to ensure fluidity and cohesion, reminiscent of genuine cloud formations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the swirling cumulus cluster positioned atop the cat’s head in a way that follows natural cloud formation and integrates seamlessly with the head’s shape without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cumulus cluster on the cat's head is shaped to naturally follow the contours of the head, wrapping around it seamlessly. The design mimics natural cloud formation, contributing to an integrated and harmonious visual without any misalignment or sign of detachment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cloud patterns integrated into the cat’s body in a way that respects the original fur direction and does not cause visible distortion or unnatural layering over the striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the original fur pattern with cloud shapes, removing the striped texture entirely. The cloud patterns are aligned to create a uniformly soft and airy appearance, which is visually pleasing and avoids any distortion or clashing with pre-existing patterns from the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the translucent wings have a soft, ethereal appearance with subtle cloud swirls and are they attached to the cat’s body in a way that preserves anatomical plausibility and spatial consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are depicted with a soft, translucent quality, adding to the ethereal theme. They have delicate cloud swirls that match the rest of the body and are realistically attached to the back, preserving anatomical plausibility and creating spatial consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vapor trails and eye swirls smoothly rendered and aligned with the cat’s facial contours, avoiding jagged lines or misplaced streaks that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vapor trails and eye swirls are rendered carefully to blend with the cat's face contours. They show smooth lines that follow the natural shape of the face without jagged edges or signs of digital artifacts, adding to the surreal and harmonious appearance of the edited image.",
