      "question": "Do the neon lighting effects seamlessly integrate with the mirror reflection, avoiding any artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lighting effects around the mirror are primarily characterized by bright pink and purple hues. The mirror reflects the interior space accurately with no visible artifacts or discrepancies in texture, which suggests a smooth integration of these vivid neon colors. Since the reflection is consistent with realistic representations of such lighting conditions, the neon effects do not introduce any unnatural textures or distortions within the area of the mirror.",

      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the sink area geometry, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the background gradient with neon shades of pink and purple blends consistently into the surrounding wall, contouring the sink's structure smoothly. The sink retains its geometric integrity, with no visible breaks or distortions amidst the vivid colors. This indicates that the background gradient complements the existing geometry, maintaining a coherent structure without any disruptions.",

      "question": "Are the materials and textures of the black cabinet visually credible, retaining fine details and avoiding unnatural changes after applying the vaporwave style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the black cabinet below the sink maintains its sleek and smooth surface appearance despite the application of a vaporwave color scheme. The details such as edges and corners remain intact, and there are no visible distortions in texture that are inconsistent with a typical material structure of such cabinets. This suggests that the materials and textures continue to appear visually credible post-edit.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the faucet and soap dispenser area retained their natural appearance without any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts during the vaporwave style conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucet and soap dispenser are highlighted against the neon backdrop but still retain familiar detailing and shapes, as expected of typical bathroom fittings. There is a clear retention of form and detail without the introduction of artifacts, suggesting that these elements maintain their natural appearance in the vaporwave context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the placements of neon lighting effects around the mirror and sink area preserve visual plausibility, ensuring physical rationality and absence of distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon lighting effects in Image B appear evenly distributed around the mirror and sink, maintaining a sense of symmetry and evenness in illumination, which corresponds with plausible light behavior. There are no evident distortions or irregular placements upsetting physical rationality, suggesting the effects are realistically and plausibly situated.",
