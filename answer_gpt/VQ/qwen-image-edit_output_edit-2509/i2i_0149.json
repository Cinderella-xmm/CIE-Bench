      "question": "Does the cat's head extend naturally out of the frame without any visible artifacts or unrealistic stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head is centered in the frame without any part extending unnaturally or showing signs of digital alteration. The proportions remain correct, and the head appears to fit well within the surrounding area, without stretching or distortion. Visual cues show a naturally positioned head, suggesting no alteration has taken place in extending it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the curled tongue depicted with natural texture and spatial depth, enhancing the illusion of it peeking out from the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's tongue is prominently sticking out with the tip curled in a realistic manner. The texture and shading of the tongue provide it with substantial depth and definition, making it appear lifelike and dimensional. No odd textures or flat appearances indicate edit errors, maintaining a convincing presentation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow on the cat's extended head and curled tongue consistent with the rest of the image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows are consistent across the cat's head and the tongue. The sunlight accentuates the right side of the cat's face, extending to the tongue, with shadows correctly aligning with the rest of the cat's body. This consistency suggests careful editing or capture without mismatches in lighting or shadow effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cat's eyes, ears, and whiskers appear proportionate and undistorted, contributing to the visual plausibility of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's facial features, including its eyes, ears, and whiskers, retain natural proportions and appearances. The eyes are symmetrically placed and sharp, ears are well-defined, and whiskers are finely detailed without any signs of distortion or disproportionate alterations, thus maintaining a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cat's fur texture and color remain natural and unaltered, ensuring the visual authenticity of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's fur texture and colors appear natural, with well-blended shades of brown, white, and black. The light reflecting off the fur enhances its realistic appearance, and there is no indication of digital tampering or inconsistencies in texture or color, preserving a natural look.",
