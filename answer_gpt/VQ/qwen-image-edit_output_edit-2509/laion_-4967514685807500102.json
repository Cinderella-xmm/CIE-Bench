    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is cartoonish art, the shrimp character does not have a human-like arm or hand structure with five fingers. Instead, the character has pincers typical of a shrimp or lobster, which are jointed and claw-like, not resembling a human hand with fingers. Thus, the description of the arm and hand is not applicable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chef's hat is depicted in a cartoon style. It lacks the detailed texture and subtle shadowing that would be present in a real-world photo. It instead features bold lines and solid colors typical of cartoon art, which do not provide realistic shadow or texture details.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lemon slice is depicted in a simplified cartoon style with bold outlines and lacks the natural surface texture of an actual lemon. Additionally, the shrimp character, being a cartoon shrimp, does not have a human hand to grip the lemon slice, so this depiction is also not applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon image (Image B), motion lines are used to show the movement of the herbs being tossed. The lines are placed around the shrimp character and are designed to suggest motion emanating from the shrimp's action. The herbs appear to disperse from around where the shrimp is acting, creating a logical origin point for the dispersion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the cartoon-style Image B, the depicted shrimp appear in a pile configuration with a cohesive overlap suggesting a stable pile. There are no pieces that seem to float or defy gravity; everything appears drawn to simulate a logical piling up.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all text elements are clearly legible and placed in bubbles or space where they do not overlap with important visual elements of the comic. The stroke thickness and style are consistent with the rest of the image's cartoon design, ensuring readability and clarity.",
