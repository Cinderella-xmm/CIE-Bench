      "question": "Are the textures on the bike frame and surrounding grass natural, without any visible artifacts or unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bike frame and surrounding grass have textures and colors that look consistent and natural. The bike frame's red color appears smooth without visible artifacts, and the grass maintains a consistent green color without patches of unusual brightness or darkness. There is no visual indication of abnormal color variations or artifacts that commonly occur from editing errors. This comparative consistency suggests that the textures in Image B are natural and maintain integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels and frame of the bike maintain their correct proportions and geometry, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle's wheels and frame appear well-proportioned and geometrically accurate. The circular shape of the wheels is maintained, and the frame's straight lines indicate a lack of distortion or deformation. The proportions appear logical and consistent with the general structure of bikes, suggesting no editing errors that could lead to geometrical inconsistencies. A comparison with Image A confirms that dimensions and proportions are preserved.",

      "question": "Is the background clean and free from distracting elements, preserving the natural scene and focusing on the bike without introducing unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B centers around the natural outdoor setting with greenery and trees. There are no extraneous elements like additional objects or distracting features that might detract from the focus on the bike. Despite Image B being presented on a phone screen, the natural setting is still seen without introducing distractions, maintaining the original scene’s simplicity and focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the bike and the surrounding area look natural and consistent with the original environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the bike and grass is consistent with a natural outdoor setting, showing even lighting without harsh artificial contrasts. Shadows cast appear natural around the bike, maintaining coherence with typical outdoor light conditions, which aligns with the image’s appearance as captured on a phone screen. Comparing both images reflects similar lighting, reinforcing the natural and consistent look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bike positioned naturally within the frame, maintaining visual coherence and plausibility without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bike’s position looks organic within the scene, benefiting from thoughtful composition central to the image. The bike is angled at a familiar riding tilt beside a bench—all elements match typical placement for visual coherence and plausibility. The comparison with Image A confirms that the bike position fits naturally in the surroundings of both images, ensuring it does not appear displaced.",
