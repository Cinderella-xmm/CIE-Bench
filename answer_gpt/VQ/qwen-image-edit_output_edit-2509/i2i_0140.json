      "question": "Do the quilts' patterns maintain their structural consistency and detailed appearance without unnatural texture disruption after conversion to a watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilts' patterns appear in a watercolor style with softened edges and diffused color blending, typical of watercolor art. The structural integrity of the geometric patterns remains, although details might be less sharply defined due to the medium's inherent characteristics. Despite this, the overall pattern is preserved, demonstrating a balance between artistic style and pattern consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors of the bedding and surrounding elements been naturally blended into the watercolor style without appearing unnaturally muted or overly vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on the bedding and surrounding elements like the flowers and pillows present a characteristic watercolor blend with soft transitions and a slightly washed-out appearance, which is normal for this style. The palette maintains a consistent tone without being too muted or overly bright, matching traditional watercolor artistry.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nightstand, picture frames, and flowers retain their natural shapes and material textures without distortion or unnatural artifacts in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nightstand and picture frames retain their basic shapes, and while the texture depiction changes due to the watercolor style, their identities remain clear. The flowers are similarly recognizable. The watercolor effect introduces some softness and texture variation, which is coherent with the artistic style, but no unnatural artifacts or distortions are evident.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the relative positions and proportions of the beds, nightstand, and wall pictures consistent and visually plausible in the watercolor illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beds, nightstand, and wall pictures maintain their spatial relationship and proportions as seen in traditional visual perspectives. The watercolor adaptation does not alter their relative positioning or scale, ensuring a coherent and plausible rendition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the quilt's intricate patchwork design stay recognizable and free from distortion or unnatural simplification in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt's patchwork design is depicted with recognition in mind, preserving the essential geometric forms and color placement despite the watercolor's inherent softness. The design is free from distortion or excessive simplification, allowing the motif to be easily identifiable.",
