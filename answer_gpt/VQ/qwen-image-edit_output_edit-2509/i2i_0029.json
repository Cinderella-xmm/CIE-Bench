      "question": "Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear to extend beyond its body onto the ground, creating a surreal pattern. The ground itself does not resemble grass as it does in Image A; instead, it mimics the zebra's stripes, creating an abstract and unnatural pattern. The visually unrealistic transition of stripes onto the ground does not blend with grass but rather forms an entirely new surreal background. Therefore, the stripes do not seamlessly blend into the grass.",

      "question": "Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear to extend into a pattern on the ground, which modifies the perception of their geometric structure. The stripes on the body remain consistent with the zebra's natural anatomy, but the continued pattern on the ground does not preserve the original proportions of the body. Thus, the geometric structure of the zebra's stripes on the body itself is preserved, but not in the extended area.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes extend beyond its body, transforming the ground into a striking pattern. Although this creates a visually interesting composition, the zebra remains a prominent element due to its distinct three-dimensional form and natural stripes against the flat striped background. Therefore, the zebra is still the focal point and not overshadowed by the surreal extension.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the surreal stripe pattern on the ground, the zebra's mane, ears, and legs remain clearly discernible and appear natural without alteration. These features stand out in natural form against the contrasting backdrop, maintaining their appearance despite the edited surroundings.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebraâ€™s stripes on its body appear intact and detailed as in the original. However, the grass is replaced by a surreal stripe pattern, losing its original texture and introducing a new abstract visual element. There is a noticeable transformation where the grass has been replaced, indicating an introduction of artifacts due to the edited stripe pattern.",
