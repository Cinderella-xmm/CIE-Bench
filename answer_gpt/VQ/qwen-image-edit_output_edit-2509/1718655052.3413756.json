    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf are designed to resemble carved wood with intricate details. The grain patterns and engraved details are consistent and appear to follow a natural wood structure. There are no distortions in the patterns, signifying that the wood texture has been applied skillfully.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are placed around the dog's neck and appear to form a continuous necklace-like structure. The bricks are well aligned and seem to be connected without any visible gaps or inconsistencies. There are no floating pieces, and the assemblage respects the physics of LEGO joins.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a light-colored wooden tabletop, which is evenly lit. There is a smooth transition between the subject and the tabletop, with no visible shadow mismatches or compositing errors. This integration suggests careful attention to lighting and shadow details.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat are symmetrical and well-positioned on both sides of the dog's head. They are shaped consistently, maintaining proportionality and alignment without any deformation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B show consistent edge definition and proper shading. They are logically placed around the dog's neck and form a continuous pattern without blocky artifacts or color clumps that would disrupt visual continuity.",
