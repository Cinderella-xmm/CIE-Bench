      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt consists of square blocks that resemble large LEGO bricks. These blocks have a distinct interlocking pattern typical of LEGO pieces. There are no fabric-like folds, stitching, or variations in texture that would be associated with traditional quilt fabrics. Instead, the quilt has the characteristic solid and matte finish of LEGO bricks, with visible grid lines formed by the alternating colors and the surface knobs typical of LEGO pieces. Therefore, the visual information combined with world knowledge identifies these as LEGO-style blocks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no round sports elements such as footballs or soccer balls present. Instead, the quilt is composed entirely of LEGO brick-like blocks with predominantly square and rectangular shapes. Each block maintains the standard LEGO dimensions and alignment, with no indication of circular tiles integrated within the grid. The absence of round sports elements and the consistent square brick pattern confirms that there are no circular LEGO tiles, stretched or otherwise.",

      "question": "Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a cube of stacked LEGO bricks is placed on the bed. This cube has equal dimensions on all sides, forming perfect right angles typical of LEGO construction, with no visible gaps or misalignments. The bricks are tightly aligned and stacked to form a seamless, consistent cube, reflecting the construction principles of LEGO. There is no indication of the soft, fabric-like characteristics of a traditional pillow.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bed base in Image B is represented as a flat, white, seamless LEGO-like structure. It lacks any visible wood grain patterns, shadows, or depth cues that would suggest texture or physical depth typically associated with a wooden base. Instead, it presents a consistent, flat appearance like that of a LEGO baseplate, maintaining the plastic-looking finish without variation across its surface.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is entirely smooth and uniform, presenting a white surface devoid of any visual features such as walls, furniture, or windows. There are no shadows or lighting gradients that may suggest the presence of a physical space or alternate elements. This consistent and unmarked background aligns with the representation of a digitally created environment rather than a photographed physical room.",
