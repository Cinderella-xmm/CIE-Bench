        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow shows proportional features such as a robust body profile, the correct size relative to the chair, and detailed feather textures. The sparrow's colors are natural, reflecting a typical appearance.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparrow's claws wrap around the top of the chair's backrest naturally, and the bird appears balanced, indicating it is perched in a natural manner. There is no visible distortion in the position of the sparrow, and its posture appears relaxed, consistent with how a sparrow would typically perch.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair shows a polished surface with visible wood grain and texture, appearing natural. The reflection and texture details are consistent with how finished woods look, enhancing realism without visible artifacts or an unnatural appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is even and consistent, casting soft shadows that correspond with the sparrow's position relative to the light source. The shadows help in grounding the sparrow on the chair and add to the dimensionality of the chair's surface, all contributing to a realistic and cohesive scene.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
