    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass candle chamber appears to have a consistent transparency that one would expect from natural glass. The light interacts realistically with the surface, demonstrating proper refraction. The embossed gold floral motifs are clearly defined and maintain a sharp, detailed appearance without any signs of distortion or unnatural textures typically seen in poorly executed digital edits.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the newly added patterned fabric background exhibit consistent texture, proper lighting interaction, and seamless integration with the teapot's shadow and reflection on the surface below, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterned fabric background shows a consistent texture and interacts with the lighting suitably, casting the correct shadows and seamlessly integrating with the teapot's reflection and shadow on the surface. There are no visible seams or lighting inconsistencies that would suggest poor digital manipulation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
