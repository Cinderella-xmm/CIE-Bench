    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jellyfish in Image B displays a delicate, translucent appearance consistent with natural jellyfish characteristics. The body is smoothly curved, exhibiting a uniform texture without noticeable seams or sharp edges, which aligns with the soft and flowing nature typical of jellyfish in an underwater setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tendrils that are elongated and gracefully curved. They exhibit an iridescent, smooth appearance without any angular distortions or segmentation, which is characteristic of naturally flowing jellyfish tendrils in aquatic environments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The internal designs within the jellyfish's bell in Image B are composed of smooth, swirling patterns that mimic bioluminescent activity. The designs do not feature repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges, maintaining the organic quality found in naturally occurring bioluminescent jellyfish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing nodules along the tendrils exhibit a soft illumination, with light gradually spreading around them. They appear in a non-uniform yet plausible arrangement, reflecting how bioluminescence can occur sporadically and attractively on jellyfish tendrils.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ambient lighting in Image B is softly diffused with prominent blue-green hues. There are faint water particles and depth cues surrounding the jellyfish, consistent with the optical qualities found in underwater environments where light is filtered through water.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question seems to suggest a conceptual misunderstanding, as jellyfish are naturally floating organisms without a structured connection to ceilings like a lantern might have. Therefore, the jellyfish should not have a connection to the ceiling, reflecting its natural free-floating state in the water, and Image B appropriately does not depict such a connection.",
