      "question": "Does the transformation into a comic book style maintain the natural appearance of the chimney sweep and his equipment without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation into a comic book style introduces textures and halftone shading typical of this genre. The chimney sweep and equipment are altered to fit this stylistic approach, emphasizing exaggerated and dramatic features while maintaining fundamental recognizability of the items like the brush and coil without introducing disruptive or unrealistic artifacts. Comic book art often includes bold, defined lines and exaggerated forms which are consistent in this transformation.",

      "question": "Does the added cityscape integrate naturally with the chimney sweep and the brick chimney without disrupting the visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cityscape added in the background, enriching the setting where the chimney sweep operates. The use of halftone shading and dramatic lines allows the integration of the cityscape with the chimney and the chimney sweep. The cityscape does not overtake the main subject but complements it by filling the environment plausibly characteristic of a chimney sweep's operational backdrop.",

      "question": "Does the yellow circle enhance the visual impact as a dramatic background element without causing distortion or breaking the geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow circle in Image B acts as a dramatic backdrop, possibly representing the sun or a spotlight to emphasize the subject. Its placement and solid color create a significant visual impact and frame the chimney sweep, adding focus without distorting the geometric integrity of the rest of the image or the circular shape itself.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines and dramatic halftone shading preserve the structural consistency and avoid degrading fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of bold outlines and halftone shading in Image B is consistent with comic book styling, where fine details are often less emphasized in favor of broader and more impactful forms. However, these techniques in Image B are applied in a manner that preserves structural consistency, maintaining the recognizable form of the chimney sweep and his tools, without significant loss of necessary detail.",

      "question": "Does the gritty caption at the bottom complement the overall image without causing visual clutter or disrupting the natural flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gritty caption at the bottom stating 'Just another day cleaning the city's lungs.' adds context and thematic depth, resonating with the character's portrayed profession and the cityscape. It is placed suitably within the composition, balancing the image without introducing clutter or disrupting its flow. Captions are typically used in this style to enhance narrative elements, effectively integrating with the visual message.",
