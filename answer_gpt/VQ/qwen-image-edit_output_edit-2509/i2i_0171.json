      "question": "Do the skis appear naturally detached from the skier with no visible artifacts or unnatural distortions in their shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis are depicted as separate pieces next to the figurine, appearing to align naturally with the action-oriented stance of the skier. The skis' shapes and alignment seem consistent, following realistic proportions and orientations associated with skiing. No visual artifacts or distortions that would be considered unnatural are visible, suggesting the design maintains a credible appearance.",

      "question": "Does the magnetic snow powder base integrate seamlessly into the snowy landscape without introducing unnatural textures or breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a base with snow powder designed to emulate a snowy landscape. The integration of the snow powder with the base is smooth and doesn't introduce odd textures or break structural consistency within the figurine context. The snow powder effect is localized and doesn't extend unnaturally into other parts of the scene, maintaining visual coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skier's facial features and body proportions accurately preserved in the figurine form, avoiding any distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's body proportions, including limb positioning and body alignment, are depicted accurately in a manner consistent with a realistic skiing posture. While facial features are not the focus, the body demonstrates no obvious distortions, maintaining detail and overall realistic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the packaging illustrations match the visual style and natural appearance of the skier and mountain environment without introducing any unnatural elements or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B portrays visual illustrations consistent with the skier's dynamic pose and the snowy mountain environment. The style closely aligns with the scene depicted, with coherent artwork that doesn't introduce out-of-place elements or visible artifacts, ensuring harmony with the skier's figurine.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the skier's hands, ski poles, and posture anatomically correct and visually credible compared to the original image, with no unnatural shapes or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing to a typical skier's posture, Image B shows the skier in a realistic skiing pose with anatomically correct hands and ski poles. The handling of ski poles and overall posture exhibit no distortions, presenting a naturalistic alignment that aligns with the original image's skiing dynamics.",
