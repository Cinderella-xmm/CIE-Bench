    "Question": "Q1: Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are transformed into LEGO bricks, which are typically rectangular prisms. The bricks appear structurally intact without any warped or broken edges, demonstrating consistent geometric shapes as expected for standard LEGO pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks have a consistent matte finish that matches the typical appearance of LEGO materials. There are no specular highlights or reflections visible, suggesting a uniform surface finish.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows LEGO bricks with interlocking features, such as studs on the tops. These features are proportionally accurate and match the standard design observed in LEGO bricks, enabling them to connect securely with other pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are neatly arranged on a wooden shelf surface, appearing stable and grounded. There are no elements defying gravity or spatial logic as there are no floating or suspended pieces visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a background with a relatively clean and neutral tone, devoid of noticeable textures or shadows. This simplicity aligns with a minimalist intent, void of conflicting elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
