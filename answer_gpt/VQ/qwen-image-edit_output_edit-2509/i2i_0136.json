      "question": "Does the orange retain a realistic glossy texture without unnatural or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange has a glossy texture which is typical for fresh oranges, reflecting light smoothly without appearing pixelated or having unnatural distortions. This glossiness is consistent with well-lit photography, where light enhances the surface's sheen. As the gloss appears natural and smooth without any artifacts, the answer is inferred based on the visual integrity observed. Thus, the texture contributes to the realistic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the stem of the orange well-integrated into the rubber keychain design, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the stem attached to a metallic ring, suggesting it has become part of a keychain. The stem's appearance is consistent with the design of a keychain meant to imitate an orange's look. It does not seem forced or out of place, blending into the design naturally as part of the keychain's attachment point. This integration maintains coherence between the stem and rest of the rubber design.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and shape of the keychain maintain a believable keychain structure, avoiding any distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange keychain retains a spherical shape typical of both real oranges and novelty keychains, with a metal ring on top which is common in keychain designs. There are no visible distortions in geometry that would make it seem unrealistic or impractical for a keychain. The proportions and shape are credible, supporting its function and aesthetic as a keychain.",

      "question": "Does the color of the orange keychain accurately reflect a citrus hue, contributing to the authenticity and visual credibility of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color in Image B represents the bright, vivid orange hue typical of a fresh orange, which is crucial in achieving realistic citrus representation. The pigmentation aligns with expectations for both a real orange and designed novelty items meant to closely imitate real fruit, thus supporting the visual credibility of the keychain as a citrus representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the rubber keychain material and the orange's surface seamless, contributing to overall visual coherence and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a seamless integration of the metallic ring with the orange design, where no harsh transitions or mismatches between materials are visible. The orange's texture harmoniously integrates with the rubber keychain construct, allowing for a coherent visual experience that is plausible as a novelty item. The transition looks smooth and natural.",
