      "question": "Does the scarf placed around the bear's neck appear naturally attached without introducing unnatural folds or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf in Image B is wrapped around the neck of both bears. The bears look plush, with slightly rounded yet smooth surfaces. The scarves rest naturally on their necks, conforming to their shape, suggesting a snug and fitting appearance without noticeable folds or gaps. The shadows and soft texture help reinforce the natural attachment, leading to a conclusion that the placement appears smooth and without visual issues.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the scarf's texture and the bear's fur texture integrate seamlessly, avoiding any noticeable artifacts or contrasting material differences?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Covering each bear's neck, the scarves in Image B are depicted in a slightly different texture than the bear's fur, symbolizing a cloth material. However, in toy design, this contrast is often intended and acceptable, with the scarf's daisy pattern matching stylistically. The overall integration works harmoniously within the image, maintaining a coherent appearance without abrupt or jarring transitions between materials.",

      "question": "Is the scarf proportionate to the bear's size, neither appearing overly large nor too small to maintain a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarves fit well around the necks of each bear. The scarves' size is well-balanced in relation to the bears' bodies, not excessively oversized nor tiny. They match typical proportions seen in plush toys or illustrations where accessories complement the main figure smoothly, confirming their proportional correctness based on visual cues combined with common proportions.",

      "question": "Does the scarf enhance the bear's cuteness factor appropriate for a Childrenâ€™s Day gift while keeping its design simple and uncluttered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the bears wearing scarves with a simple, pleasant pattern of small white flowers. This subtle addition adds charm and fits themes suitable for children's items. The simplicity and color coordination contribute to the overall cute aesthetic without overcrowding the design, making it suitable for children's gifting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bear's facial features and paw details preserved intact after adding the scarf, without any degradation or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both bears in Image B retain full facial features with clear eyes, noses, and mouth shapes, alongside well-defined paw prints. The scarves do not interfere with or obscure these original elements. The attention to consistent quality throughout features suggests the scarf addition has been executed without degradation, preserving the overall detailed design.",
