      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version of the person in the foreground has a suit and cup that are rendered in 3D style. The suit maintains the usual shape and texture associated with business attire without any visible distortion. The cup is held naturally and appears proportionate in size and shape. Comparing this with Image A, we can see that both maintain their structural integrity, showing that Image B is consistent with usual texture expectations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person in the background and the lamp are rendered in a 3D style that retains the natural appearance. The suit looks smooth, and the lamp emits a warm glow similar to the original lamp in Image A. There are no visible artifacts, showing that Image B has accurately maintained the textures and illumination.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts both chibi characters with detailed suit textures that retain the elements of formal attire. The facial features, while blurred, are made in 3D style with textures suitable for such representations. This shows consistency with the original Image A's detail levels, therefore avoiding unnatural appearance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the cup appears natural, proportionate, and textured correctly within the 3D style. The positioning and size are consistent and comparable to the original depiction in Image A, showing a physically plausible representation without visible distortion.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the photo frame around the 3D scene introduces an aspect of presentation that can make the composition feel more formal and polished. This enhances the visual credibility by showcasing the scene as a framed artwork, akin to traditional portraits, thereby increasing perceived realism.",
