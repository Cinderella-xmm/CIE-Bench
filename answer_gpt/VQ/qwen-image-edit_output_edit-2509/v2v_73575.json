      "question": "Does the origami bird on the left retain a natural appearance with no visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the origami bird on the left is crafted from what appears to be paper maps, with the visible lines suggesting this texture. Origami itself leans towards being an artistic representation rather than a natural one. The paper's texture contributes to its authenticity as an origami piece, consistent with how one might construct such an artwork in reality. Given this artistic nature, there are no unnatural textures or digital artifacts that are inconsistent with what would be expected from origami.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminous crystalline structure of the bird on the right visually credible without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Bird on the right in Image B is depicted as having a body made up of luminous crystalline structures. The shapes comprising this are angular and geometric, consistent with how such structures are typically depicted in both art and nature if they were imagined as crystal. There are no visual breakages, distortions, or inconsistencies in these geometric shapes, which allows it to maintain credibility in terms of visual representation.",

      "question": "Are the colossal, intricately carved ivory chess rooks structurally consistent with the birds perched on them, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are perched on chess queens (often called 'rooks' incorrectly here). The scaling between the birds and the chess pieces appears consistent, ensuring that the size and proportion make sense together. The chess pieces appear intricately carved and detailed, retaining a seamless integration with the birds perched atop. There is no evidence of visual distortion or inconsistency within this composition.",

      "question": "Does the surreal library setting with drifting books maintain visual plausibility without introducing any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The library in Image B is grand and has an expansive, surreal architectural design with numerous bookshelves that create an artistic ambiance. Floating books and birds add to the surreal theme but remain consistent within this fictional universe. There are no visible artifacts or disjointed elements that detract from its created reality. The setting's visual plausibility is maintained throughout its surreal representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image as a whole maintain structural coherence and visual credibility, with all elements appearing naturally integrated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, featuring origami and crystalline birds on chess pieces within a grand library setting, is artistically composed. Each element, from the birds to the library's structure, fits within this surreal and fantastical depiction. The repeated use of grand scales, ornate details, and consistent artistic styles ensures all components are well-integrated without jarring inconsistencies, thus maintaining overall coherence and visual credibility.",
