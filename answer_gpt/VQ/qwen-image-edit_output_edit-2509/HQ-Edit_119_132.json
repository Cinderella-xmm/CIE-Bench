      "question": "Are the paws of the husky significantly larger than natural proportions but still maintaining smooth, rounded shapes without distorted edges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paws of the husky are indeed larger than what would be natural proportions for a Siberian Husky. This is evidenced by their exaggerated rounded shapes and the plush, toy-like appearance they have. The paws do not show any distortion or broken geometry, which offers a smooth outline consistent with the plush style. This analysis is based solely on observations from Image B without comparing with Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entire body covered in a seamless, velvety fabric texture that uniformly replaces the original fur without visible seams, texture inconsistencies, or areas where fur remains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire body of the husky shows a consistent plush appearance typical of a toy, where the texture is uniformly smooth and resembles a velvety fabric. There are no visible seams, and any original fur texture has been completely replaced. This observation is derived from the apparent textile quality of the material covering the toy husky.",

      "question": "Are the eyes replaced with clearly defined, symmetrical embroidered patterns that maintain proper positioning and spacing relative to the nose and ears, without jagged lines or misplaced stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the husky's eyes as symmetric, circular, and resembling embroidered patterns which are typical characteristics of plush toys' eyes. These eyes are well-positioned with respect to the husky's nose and ears. The lines and stitches creating the eyes are smooth and do not appear jagged or misplaced, which is characteristic of the manufacturing quality of plush toys.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail appear significantly fuller and fluffier than in the original image but remain attached to the body with a continuous, cohesive shape and no floating or detached segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the husky toy is visibly full and fluffy, aligning with a plush toyâ€™s design, while appearing well-attached to the body. It doesn't display any discontinuity or segments that seem detached, maintaining a continuous and cohesive shape that integrates well with the rest of its body.",

      "question": "Has the original snowy landscape and surrounding trees been fully replaced by a clean wooden shelf and minimalist backdrop, with no traces of snow, trees, or sky remaining in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been entirely replaced by a plain white backdrop with the husky placed on a simple wooden shelf. There are no remaining elements of a snowy landscape, trees, or sky, as there is a clean, minimalist design replacing the outdoors setting typically seen in plush toy advertisement or display settings.",
