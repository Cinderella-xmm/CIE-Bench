      "question": "Do the armored medieval knights maintain the same size proportions relative to the crib and wall as the original stuffed animals did?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the knights appear significantly larger than typical stuffed animals, suggesting a change in proportion. Medieval knight armors are inherently larger due to the anatomical scale needed to fit a human. Given the size of the crib and the wall relative to the knights in Image B, they appear proportionally larger compared to the original stuffed animals in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or color gradients where the knights' armor meets the floor or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the area where the knights' armor contacts the floor and wall, the metal armor surfaces seem consistently rendered, maintaining a seamless interaction with surrounding elements. There are no evident signs of unnatural textures or mismatched color gradients.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the armored medieval knights cast realistic shadows consistent with the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light source appears to be from the left side, casting shadows from the knights on the floor. The shadows are logically positioned and spread, consistent with how light would fall and reflect off metallic surfaces in the given room lighting, similar to the original image's shadows from the stuffed animals.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the knights positioned in a way that appears natural and plausible, as if they were sitting against the wall like the stuffed animals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knights in Image B are displayed in a seated posture against the wall, as if mimicking the seating position of the stuffed animals. Despite the armor, this seated look is plausible given the rigid posture inherent to such armor, and spatial context of placement against a wall.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the armor of the knights exhibit fine details and a level of detail that matches the rest of the image's clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knights' armor in Image B is intricately detailed, with the metallic textures reflecting realism in terms of clarity. The detailed rivets, polished surfaces, and shadow consistency match the overall image quality, akin to the high-detail clarity and fluffy texture of the original stuffed animals in Image A.",
