      "question": "Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are exaggerated in size, characteristic of a cartoon or stylized representation. The muscles are overly large compared to a natural human physique, which is a common feature in caricature or comic art styles. Given that it's a stylization, the anatomical accuracy is less of a focus. The contours and muscle groups are drawn for effect more than realistic anatomical depiction, leading to the conclusion that they do not maintain anatomical plausibility.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gym-themed motifs on the tank top and shorts clearly rendered with consistent material properties and no overlapping or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing (tank top and shorts) features colorful motifs such as gym-themed icons. These motifs are rendered distinctly, with clear separation between images. The textures appear smooth and consistent, without overlapping or fragmentation, in line with a cartoon style aiming for visual clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the barâ€™s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barbell features icons on the weight plates. These icons are symmetrically placed on each side of the central axis of the barbell, maintaining consistency in alignment. They are properly integrated onto the surface of the weights without appearing detached or misaligned with the bar's curvature.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a mirror reflection similar to Image A but rather a cartoon-style representation without shadow interactions or reflections. Shadows are not a prominent feature in this illustrative style, as it's focused more on the character's design rather than a realistic environmental interaction.",

      "question": "Is the calendar strip aligned horizontally along the bottom edge of the panel and sized appropriately to match the scale of the figure and surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar strip is placed at the bottom of the wooden panel. It appears horizontally aligned and proportionally fitting within the overall design which includes the figure above it. The design ensures the calendar strip is visibly coherent with the scale of the rest of the composition without appearing out of place.",
