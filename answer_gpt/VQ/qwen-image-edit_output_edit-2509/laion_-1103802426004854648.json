      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse showcases a translucent pink glass body that exhibits smooth bubbles and consistent texture throughout. The glass effect is uniform without any jagged, inconsistent, or artificial applications. This uniformity indicates high-quality rendering, which is evident through the even distribution of reflections and color gradients. Image A depicts a plush seahorse, which does not have the glass-like qualities observed in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's yellow belly is indeed rendered as a smooth opaque glass surface. It has a musical treble clef precisely etched onto it, and the symbol's edges are clean, showing no signs of blurring or deformation. This detail showcases a careful crafting process often seen in high-quality objects or images. Image A has a plastic belly with a heart and music note symbol that reflects typical toy manufacturing, which lacks the intricate etching seen in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ribbons are rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and reflect light appropriately, indicating the quality of material and rendering. They maintain their original, intended shape without any warping or distortion, resembling glass decorative elements. Image A shows plush ribbons without glass elements but shares the same shape and style of placement, indicating consistency in design despite the change in material properties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface with distinct mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body. The stand is seamlessly integrated with a smooth transition to the seahorse's base, avoiding any gaps or floating effects. This integration indicates a coherent design ensuring the object appears grounded and physically balanced. There exists no equivalent base or stand in Image A, making Image B unique in this regard.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains consistency across all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—in terms of lighting, shadow, and material properties. There are no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending, indicating a high level of craftsmanship or digital rendering skill. This consistent rendering aligns every component in a cohesive visual narrative making it appear realistic and polished. Image A, on the other hand, uses plush and plastic materials typical of a toy, offering a vastly different aesthetic.",
