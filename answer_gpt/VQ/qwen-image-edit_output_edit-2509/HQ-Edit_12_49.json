      "question": "Does the outer box retain the rich mahogany color and wood grain texture that matches the original clock's frame, without unnatural shifts in tone or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual analysis of Image B indicates that the outer box has a rich, reddish-brown color, akin to mahogany commonly used in luxurious finishes, and displays a textured appearance suggestive of wood. This aligns with the world knowledge that such materials are used for high-end packaging. Considering the emphasis on harmony with the clock's frame, there are no visible unnatural shifts or textures deviating from a high-quality wood-like finish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the modern watch positioned centrally within the box, with its face size and numeral style proportionally consistent with the original clock’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the watch centrally positioned inside the box. The watch face displays Roman numerals, much like the original clock, maintaining consistency in typeface style. Proportions are visually assessed, showing similar scale within their respective contexts—clock's face on the wall and the watch face within the box. This suggests a design effort to keep consistent proportionality and numeral style across different products.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of Image B reveals that the interior lining of the box appears smooth and consistent, without visible marks or imperfections.

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the engraved plaque positioned directly below the watch, flush with the base of the box, and does it display clear, non-distorted text or markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an engraved plaque situated directly beneath the watch, appearing neatly embedded and flush with the bottom of the box. The text on the plaque, while visibly embossed or engraved, is clear with no distortion. This reflects typical attributes of high-end presentation boxes with precise engraving for legibility and decorative appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the baroque decorative elements on the box fully detailed and three-dimensionally rendered, with consistent lighting and shadowing that match the original clock’s relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observation of the baroque elements on the box in Image B reveals elaborate detailing with a perception of depth, highlighting three-dimensional craftsmanship. The attention to lighting creates shadows consistent with the realistic projections on the clock's frame in Image A, ensuring an aesthetic and style match akin to traditional baroque relief work.",
