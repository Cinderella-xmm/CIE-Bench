    "Question": "Q1: Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's head appears larger than the body, maintaining smooth contours and proportional alignment with the torso and limbs. This enlarged head is characteristic of cartoon-style illustrations and maintains consistent alignment without visible distortion, typical of exaggerated features in animated art. Comparing Image B with Image A, Image B has been artistically styled, allowing the head size to be exaggerated while preserving overall proportions without tearing or stretching.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the patterns on the character’s suit evenly distributed, free from repeating tiles or jagged edges, and do they follow a logical direction consistent with fabric draping?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a suit with brightly colored, intricate patterns that appear evenly distributed across the fabric. The swirls and curves follow a natural direction, indicative of fanciful textile draping in cartoonish fashion design. These patterns do not show signs of repetition or jagged edges, suggesting a custom design that moves logically along the suit's fabric, in contrast to Image A's plain suit which does not feature such designs.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the oversized glasses fully rendered with clear lenses and frames, aligned with the eye region, and without partial transparency or clipping against facial features?",
    "explanation": "Image B exhibits oversized glasses rendered with clarity, maintaining consistent alignment around the eye area. The glasses do not demonstrate clipping or partial transparency, typical issues found in poorly edited images. The rendering aligns well with cartoonish elements seen in other aspects of the image. In Image A, no glasses are present for direct comparison.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the hand have exactly five fingers, with natural curvature and spacing, and are there no distorted knuckles, extra digits, or unnatural shadowing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hand is drawn with five fingers, displaying natural curvature and spacing expected in animated illustrations. The fingers are depicted with realistic bending and spacing, without any distortion, extra digits, or unusual shadows that would disrupt the natural appearance. This style maintains the cartoon character aesthetic found throughout Image B. Image A also displays a well-rendered hand, but follows a realistic style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned at plausible distances, casting soft shadows, and aligned with the character’s perspective without floating above ground or appearing detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract skyscrapers and balloons are depicted artistically, with vibrant colors and fanciful designs, positioned at varying distances typical of a cityscape. They cast shadows and align with the character’s perspective, maintaining coherence with the imaginary setting. While exaggerated, they adhere to an artistic logic, contrasting Image A's realistic event setting, without having elements that appear detached or overtly floating.",
