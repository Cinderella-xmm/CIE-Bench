      "question": "Do the chibi-fied players maintain a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures or artefacts that disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-fied characters in Image B exhibit a stylistic design that is simplified and cartoon-like, which is typical for chibi art. The characters are rendered with solid color fills and clean outlines, which appear consistent within this type of illustration. There is no indication of unnatural textures or artefacts present on the characters themselves, suggesting their appearance remains natural within the context of chibi art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outfits and hairstyles of the chibi-fied players proportionally and physically rational, avoiding any distortion that conflicts with the natural appearance of the players?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the players in a stylized chibi form, which inherently involves some exaggeration of proportions. However, the elements such as the outfits and hairstyles conform to the typical proportions found in chibi art. The clothes fit the characters' bodies appropriately within the chibi style and show no signs of distortion conflicting with their appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the act of the chibi-fied players holding tennis rackets and shaking hands seem structurally consistent and free from deformation, fitting naturally into the pastoral setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the activity of the chibi characters holding rackets and shaking hands is properly depicted with proportional arms and rackets in relation to their body size. Although the chibi styling is cartoonish, the action itself is coherent and natural within the scene framed for chibi illustrations, though unrelated to a pastoral setting.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the semi-transparent court logo in the background appear naturally integrated and does not introduce any visual distractions or distortions that detract from the scene’s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The semi-transparent court logo in Image B is situated in the background behind the players. It blends into the setting without overwhelming the primary focus, thus integrating naturally. It does not noticeably distort the image or distract from the scene’s authenticity.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the inclusion of chibi-fied players with tennis rackets and the court logo maintain the image's compositional balance and visual plausibility, without disrupting the natural arrangement of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of chibi-fied players and a court logo in Image B introduces unnatural elements to the pastoral setting evident in Image A, creating a juxtaposition. These elements disrupt the compositional balance and visual plausibility concerning the original rural environment depicted, thus not maintaining the original arrangement.",
