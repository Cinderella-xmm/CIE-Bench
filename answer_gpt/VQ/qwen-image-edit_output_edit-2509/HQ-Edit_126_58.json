      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing area of the swan now part of a bottle exhibits a frosted glass texture that aligns well with the ambient lighting conditions, hinting at a smooth transition from the ice sculpture in Image A to the glass material in Image B. The areas seem consistent in texture, without noticeable seams or surface distortions, maintaining the translucency observed in typical frosted glass or ice. The editing process preserved the natural qualities of the ice sculpture, avoiding artificial appearances.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan's neck is smoothly transformed into a glass bottle's stopper, maintaining a graceful, tapered shape consistent with natural proportions of a swan's neck. The transformation appears seamless, avoiding any signs of unnatural bending or jagged edges, and it aligns well volumetrically with the rest of the swan-body-bottle, suggesting careful attention to coherence and continuity in the editing process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative elements including red, pink, and green accents are well integrated into the composition surrounding the bottle base. They are positioned to appear naturally resting in the foreground snow without appearing to float or be disconnected. The colors and textures are preserved with clarity, avoiding any blurriness or pixelation, ensuring a visually cohesive presentation that allows the decorative elements to enhance the festive theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"Winter Glow\" text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains the \"Winter Glow\" text on the transformed bottle, which is clearly visible and appears well-aligned with the bottle's surface curvature, following the bottleâ€™s front without distortion. The subtle iridescent effect is smooth, consistent, and free from unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts, contributing to a polished, professional look in the context of a commercial product design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall shape of the swan-bottle in Image B maintains a structural coherence that successfully merges the artistic aspects of both a swan sculpture and a bottle. Each part, from the neck to the base, is proportionally aligned without evidence of warping, stretching, or disjointed sections. This ensures the continuity of form, supporting both aesthetic appeal and functional believability as a perfume bottle.",
