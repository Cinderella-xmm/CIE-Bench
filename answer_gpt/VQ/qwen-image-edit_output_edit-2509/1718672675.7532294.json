      "question": "Do the armor-like rock sections maintain visible sedimentary layering and natural erosion contours consistent with the surrounding cliff face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor-like rock sections on the giant's body need to be assessed for whether they maintain features consistent with natural cliffs as seen in their shape and texture. Natural sedimentary cliffs like those found in Image A would typically show layers and contours formed by geological processes over time, such as sediment deposition and erosion. In Image B, the rock sections do not seem to exhibit such features; rather, they appear artificial, smooth, and shaped to form the giant's armor, lacking the stratifications and erosion marks characteristic of natural cliffs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moss growth confined to shaded or moist areas of the rock armor and does it show natural variation in density and color rather than uniform application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss on the giant's armor should realistically appear in areas where moisture and shade would naturally encourage growth. Typically, this means north-facing or shaded sections that can retain moisture. However, the moss in Image B seems to cover various parts of the armor uniformly without clear consideration of natural growth conditions, appearing more decorative than realistic in its application.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the spectral limbs originate from the cliff base and merge with the sea surface in a way that preserves water-level continuity and avoids floating or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spectral limbs are depicted as emanating from the base of the giant and interacting with the sea. For a realistic integration, they should give the impression of continuity with the water, with smooth transitions and logical positions relative to the water's surface. The depiction shows the spectral forms merging with the sea, suggesting a flow that maintains connection rather than appearing visually detached or floating unnaturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees forming the mane spaced irregularly and angled naturally along the cliff edge, consistent with wind exposure and terrain slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees on the giant's mane should be positioned in a manner reflective of their natural environment, such as being unevenly spaced and oriented in response to wind and terrain. The trees seen in Image B appear to follow a pattern meant to create an overall design rather than mimicking natural randomness and environmental influences. They give the impression of being arranged rather than naturally growing.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the runes follow natural rock fissures and exhibit soft edges with shadowing that matches ambient lighting, rather than appearing as crisp, untextured overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the runes to appear naturally integrated into the giant's body, they would ideally follow the natural fissures and curves of the rock, with shadowing that reflects the ambient light environment. In Image B, however, the runes appear as crisp, glowing symbols that do not interact with the texture or contours of the rock in a realistic way, lacking the nuanced shadowing and subtler blending with the rocky surface.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the spiraling spirits emit or absorb light in a way that matches the sun's position and create subtle volume effects consistent with mist or vapor, without sharp edges or unnatural opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiraling spirits should be depicted with qualities similar to natural mist or vapor, meaning they would have soft edges, variations in density, and light interactions consistent with the scene's lighting. The sun in the background suggests a certain direction and quality of lighting. The spirits in Image B do emit light and exhibit some softness in their volume effects, achieving a level of transparency and diffusion that aligns with ambient light, appearing as a believable mist.",
