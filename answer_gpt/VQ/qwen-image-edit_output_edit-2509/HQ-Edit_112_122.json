    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress clearly defined, proportionally consistent with the garment’s scale, and free from jagged edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress lacks any floral patterns as it appears to consist of a single color gradient transitioning from red to blue. There are no visible jagged edges or pixelated artifacts on the dress’s fabric which suggests smoothness and consistency appropriate for the garment's scale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lighting from the top right cast soft gradients on the woman’s face, dress, and nearby flowers without causing unnatural overexposure or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is diffused uniformly, casting soft gradients across the woman’s dress and the flowers, enhancing the vibrant and idyllic scene without any apparent overexposure or disconnected highlights. The light transitions are smooth, maintaining the scene’s natural atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floating petals distributed evenly in mid-air, showing natural dispersion and depth, with no clustered or floating-in-place anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals appear to be distributed evenly in the air, maintaining natural dispersion and depth. They are spread out throughout the image, creating a sense of motion without clustering in one place or exhibiting anomalies such as unnaturally suspended positions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral vines surrounding the writing area appear to extend naturally with consistent thickness and color, seamlessly blending in with the broader floral theme. There are no abrupt starts or breaks in the vines, maintaining a consistent visual flow and direction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s left hand show five distinct fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does the hand appear attached correctly to the arm without distortion?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's left hand is depicted reaching outward with each finger clearly defined, showing natural curvature and spacing. The hand appears correctly attached to the arm, maintaining anatomical realism without distortion.",
