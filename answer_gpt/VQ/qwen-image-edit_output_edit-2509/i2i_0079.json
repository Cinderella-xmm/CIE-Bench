    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the collectible figure design on the dresser maintain structural coherence and appear naturally integrated into the existing scene without introducing any unnatural artifacts or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure is placed atop the dresser. To evaluate if it maintains coherence and natural integration, one must observe how it blends with the dresser's surface, surrounding objects, and overall lighting. The collectible figure stands on a circular base, fitting seamlessly on the dresser without visible artifacts or shadows that would suggest awkward edits or aliasing issues. The texture and reflections on the figure appear consistent with the lighting and materials evident on other dresser objects, suggesting a coherent integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportion and physical rationality of the collectible figure design consistent with the surrounding elements on the dresser, ensuring it does not appear distorted or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The relative size of the collectible figure in Image B should be compared against identifiable objects like the vase and candle on the dresser. The figure's size is plausible; it neither overshadows nor is dwarfed by the objects. It follows a sensible scale, appearing balanced and proportional in relation to the other items, without any distortion or awkward sizing issues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the color scheme of the collectible figure design blend naturally with the existing elements on the dresser, maintaining the overall sense of reality and avoiding any jarring contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the collectible figure's color scheme needs to harmonize with the other elements on the dresser, such as the vase and the bound books, which typically display neutral and subtle tones. The figure exhibits color tones that do not clash or starkly contrast with these items, maintaining the scene's atmospheric cohesion and realism without introducing harsh or incongruent colors.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures of the collectible figure design well-preserved, matching the quality and style of the other objects on the dresser, thus avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Fine details on the collectible figure in Image B should match the resolution and styling of the vase and decorative items beside it. The sculpting lines, attire detail, and facial features of the figure seem crisp and in line with the subtly detailed style of the room's elements, and there are no apparent textural disparities that would lead to a perceived loss of quality or unnaturalness.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the collectible figure design on the dresser appear logically placed, enhancing the scene's overall visual credibility without disrupting the existing arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, placement and arrangement should resonate with spatial awareness typical in home decor. The collectible figure is centrally yet sensibly positioned, allowing it to exist within a natural cluster of items, such as the vase and other decorations. Its placement avoids overcrowding and maintains a balanced aesthetic typical of a minimalist, well-curated styling approach.",
