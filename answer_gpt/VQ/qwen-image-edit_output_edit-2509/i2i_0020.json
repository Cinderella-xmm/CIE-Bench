      "question": "Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train and STOP sign are rendered in a minimalist style that uses simplified geometry. The shapes of the train and STOP sign appear clean and precise, indicating that the simplification process did not distort or break the shapes. Simplified geometric representation is common in minimalist illustrations, where the focus is on essential forms rather than intricate details.",

      "question": "Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green mountain outlines and the track lines in Image B are depicted in a simple and consistent manner without complex details, and they blend well with the overall cool-toned color scheme of the image. This demonstrates a deliberate choice to maintain uniformity within the minimalist style and avoid any elements that may clash with the intended aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are simplified as part of the minimalist approach, which inherently involves the removal of detailed textures. Although specific textures are not present, the essential forms, such as the train structure and STOP sign, are preserved effectively. Therefore, while texture detail is reduced, the appearance remains natural and not distorted, aligning with minimalist principles where form is prioritized over texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spatial arrangement in Image B respects real-world locality by keeping the train parallel to the tracks and positioning the STOP sign correctly at the platform's edge. This coherence in spatial relationships affirms visual credibility while still embodying a minimalist style, as the basic placement of elements remains intuitive and believable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cool-toned palette in Image B is primarily composed of greens and blues, maintaining consistent use of these hues throughout the illustration, including the train, STOP sign, background, and tracks. This consistent palette supports the minimalist traffic safety theme with tones that are calm and visually harmonious, aiding viewer comprehension.",
