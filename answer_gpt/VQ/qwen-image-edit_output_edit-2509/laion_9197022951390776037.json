      "question": "Are the eyes positioned just below the label and do they follow the curvature of the bottle with consistent lighting and reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are positioned just below the label on the bottle. They follow the curvature of the bottle, appearing natural and consistent with the round shape of the bottle. The lighting and reflection on the eyes match the lighting on the rest of the bottle, ensuring that the eyes do not appear out of place or unrealistic. This visual integration indicates careful attention to the way the eyes interact with the bottle's surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vines wrap around the bottle in a continuous, physically plausible manner without floating or intersecting the bottle in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, vines are depicted wrapping around the bottle. The vines appear continuous and follow the contours of the bottle naturally, without floating off or intersecting it unnaturally. The vines are integrated with the environment and the bottle's shape, providing a visually plausible representation where vines are often seen in vineyards, enhancing the thematic consistency with the wine and grapevine setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the modified label icon a clear, proportionate face with distinct features that match the original icon's style and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original label icon from Image A has been modified significantly. The face on the edited bottle has more elements like eyes and other facial features compared to the simpler scarecrow icon on the original. This gives the modified label a different style and focus. It does not directly match the original iconâ€™s minimalist style or size, instead taking a more detailed and character-like appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background include layered grapevines and mist that recede naturally without obscuring or clipping the bottle incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a richly layered environment with grapevines and mist. The grapevines are positioned naturally in the scene, receding into the distance, which enhances the perspective without interfering with the visibility of the bottle. The mist further adds depth and atmosphere, complementing the wine theme without clipping with the bottle. This creates a harmonious scene where elements are well integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure\" clearly visible, correctly positioned, and free from rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure' is added below the SCARECROW text. The title is clearly visible, with proper contrast against the label. It is well positioned, centralized on the label, and does not show any visible rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding. This ensures that the text remains legible and professional, consistent with the quality expected from wine bottle labels.",
