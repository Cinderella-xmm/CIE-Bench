        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone carving of the woman in Image B shows a deity in a seated pose with hands and legs in a traditional and symmetrical position.

        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, where Image A had a lush real jungle, Image B uses sculpted representations of a jungle in relief form.
