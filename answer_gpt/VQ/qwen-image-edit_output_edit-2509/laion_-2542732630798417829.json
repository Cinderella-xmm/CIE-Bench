      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish face drawn on the light bulb features eyes and a smile. These elements are placed on the exterior surface of the bulb in a manner typical for such illustrations, avoiding interference with the internal components of the bulb. The filament inside the bulb is visible and clearly distinguishable, indicating that the facial features are applied in a way that neither distorts nor obscures the internal structure. This suggests that the eyes and smile do not interfere with the visibility of the filament structure inside.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon arms in Image B appear to be integrated into the design of the character, extending naturally from the bulb's form. They follow the bulb's curvature and are consistent with the whimsical style of the illustration. The arms do not appear to be floating or disjointed, and they correctly align with the light bulb character without disrupting the image's geometric coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal cage around the bulb is depicted as being entirely in place. All loops that comprise the cage structure appear to be connected and evenly distributed around the bulb. There are no indications of missing or distorted sections, and the symmetric arrangement is maintained as is characteristic of such a design. This suggests that the metal cage is intact without any noticeable deviations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases various background elements within a comic book style. These elements collectively enhance the comic framing but are somewhat stylized, making it less straightforward to evaluate based on realistic lighting principles. Illustrations like these may not strictly adhere to realistic light casting and reflection rules, but they maintain internal consistency within the artistic style. However, such consistency does suggest an acknowledgment of the bulb's light source in the image's context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are evenly distributed across the comic's elements, including glass, metal, and background. There are no signs of color banding, oversaturation, or any other common issues that could degrade visual quality. The image's colors maintain a harmonious balance, making the artwork appear polished and visually pleasing within its style, indicating an even application of colors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text boxes and speech bubbles are positioned thoughtfully to ensure the content is comprehensible and does not overlap with critical visual elements like the bulb's structure or the metal cage. The speech bubbles are placed in areas that leverage the available space to maximize readability. This considerate arrangement ensures clear communication of text without infringing on essential visual features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms of the bulb character in Image B are shown following a logical and natural positioning example typical in cartoon illustrations. They neither intersect with the bulb’s glass nor with the surrounding metal cage in a way that defies graphical coherency or logic. The integration of the arms respects both the physical form of the bulb and the illustrative style presented, supporting the perception of a coherent character design.",
