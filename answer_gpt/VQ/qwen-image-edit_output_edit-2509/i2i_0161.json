      "question": "Does the text \"Catch the Wave\" appear to blend naturally with the sky without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Catch the Wave' text is placed over a clear blue sky. The font is bold and outlined in white, which typically helps make text stand out against a sky background without disrupting the image's natural texture. The text does not appear to introduce any pixelation or misalignment with the sky. The background remains consistent and there is no visible addition of texture or artifacts that would suggest poor integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the placement of \"Catch the Wave\" maintain the structural integrity of the horizon and waves, avoiding any visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Catch the Wave' is positioned in the upper part of the image over the sky area and does not interact with the horizon or water directly. As a result, there is no interference or distortion of the ocean waves or horizon line. Therefore, the placement does not affect the natural alignment of these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note clearly legible and aligned naturally within the bottom-left sand area, without disrupting the beach's texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Summer Adventures – 2025' text is located in the bottom-left corner over the sand. The font is appropriately sized and legible. The placement appears natural and the text does not disrupt the texture of the sand beneath it. The text color contrast is adequate for clear legibility while harmoniously integrating with the existing sand texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both the \"Catch the Wave\" text and \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note seem logically placed and contextually appropriate within the beach scene, contributing positively to the overall visual narrative?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both text elements in Image B are logically placed: 'Catch the Wave' occupies the top portion over the sky, often seen as titles or headers in visual media, while 'Summer Adventures – 2025' is lower, serving as a caption or subtitle. Both elements fit the beach and surfing context thematically, enhancing the narrative by suggesting a sporty and adventurous theme that aligns with people preparing to surf.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and light effects around the \"Catch the Wave\" text and \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note consistent with the lighting in the rest of the image, preserving the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent in the overall scene, with sunlight illuminating the beach and subjects prominently. The text 'Catch the Wave' is outlined in white, which does not cast visible shadows that would conflict with natural lighting. Similarly, 'Summer Adventures – 2025' is neatly placed without shadowing effects that would disrupt the lighting. Both texts maintain the overall image's natural appearance and light consistency.",
