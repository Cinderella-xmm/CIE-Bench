      "question": "Does the doll figure and wooden stump appear as a cohesive oil painting with visible canvas texture, without introducing any unnaturally hard edges or overly pixelated areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image appears to have employed an oil painting effect to mimic the texture and style of a painting. The visual details, including softening of lines and introduction of a canvas-like texture, suggest an effort to create a cohesive painting effect across the photograph. There are no excessively sharp edges or pixelation that would disrupt this look, suggesting successful application of blending techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the doll figure and wooden stump preserved accurately after being converted into an oil painting, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering Image B, the proportions and shapes of the doll figure and the wooden stump remain consistent with realistic dimensions and positioning. When transitioning into an oil painting style, maintaining these attributes ensures that the figures still hold structural coherence and do not appear distorted or uneven.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the oil painting-style artwork of the doll figure and wooden stump and the unedited parts of the image smooth, avoiding visible lines or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition into oil painting style seems to seamlessly integrate with surrounding elements, suggesting a smooth blending of artistic techniques without introducing discernible lines or artifacts. This suggests that the stylistic transformation was applied evenly across the concerned areas.",

      "question": "Does the warm color palette used in the oil painting-style artwork blend naturally with the surrounding environment, avoiding any jarring contrasts or artificial hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a warm color palette, characteristic of traditional oil paintings, which harmonizes well with the overall environment depicted in the photograph. This avoids stark contrasts and integrates naturally without introducing colors that appear out of place or artificially enhanced.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the oil painting-style artwork of the doll figure and wooden stump fit logically within the context of the image, enhancing rather than disrupting the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, the elements like the doll figure and wooden stump exist naturally within the scene's setting as objects in a dining environment. The oil painting effect enhances these features artistically without disrupting the narrative or logical placement within the image.",
