      "question": "Does the tall glass on the right display consistent pixelated and circuit-like textures across its surface without visible cracks, jagged edges, or inconsistent rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass on the right is enveloped in neon-like textures that are pixelated and replicating circuit-like patterns. Upon inspection, these textures seem coherent and consistent across the surface, lacking visible cracks or jagged edges. The rendering of these textures maintains integrity, signifying a continuous and stable design. This conclusion is drawn by assessing the neon patterns displayed on the glass in the edited image while acknowledging typical digital circuit-like designs that appear smooth and uniform.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the Sydney Opera House composed of continuous, evenly spaced neon lines that maintain the correct number and shape of the shell structures without misalignment or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the Sydney Opera House illuminated by neon lines that brightly outline each shell structure with precision. The number and shape of these structures appear accurately represented, with no explicit signs of misalignment or missing segments in the outlines. This determination is based on analyzing the image's depiction of the opera house where the outlines are clearly bright and well-maintained, typical of neon effects aimed at emphasizing structure contours.",

      "question": "Do the wave patterns in the water consist of uniform, repeating geometric shapes that align horizontally and vertically without overlapping irregularly or creating gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water beneath the Sydney Opera House contains patterns created by neon outlines. These patterns portray uniform, repeating geometric shapes that maintain consistent horizontal and vertical alignment. There is no visible overlapping or irregular gaps disrupting the continuity of the wave patterns. This evaluation leverages typical geometric design principles, where uniformity and regularity indicate a deliberate and systematic pattern.",

      "question": "Does the beverage in the shorter glass show a consistent holographic effect with subtle layering and refraction, without distorting the shape of the ice cubes or causing unnatural transparency gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the beverage in the shorter glass with a holographic texture, characterized by subtle layering and refraction effects. Through observation, this holographic effect seems uniform across the beverage without altering the recognizable shape of the ice cubes or producing unnatural transparency gradients. The effects provide a stable translucent appearance typical of well-designed holographic imagery, implying consistent rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the two glasses aligned with the direction of the sunset lighting, and do they match the apparent position of the sun in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain specific indications regarding the position of the sun or sunset lighting; thus, shadows are assessed in terms of alignment and context. Neon-style depictions often alter typical shadow presentations, rendering conventional sunset-lighting shadow judgments ineffective. In the absence of evident sunlight positioning, and given the artistic abstraction of Image B, standard alignment of shadows with sunset lighting as depicted in real-life scenarios cannot be confirmed. The absence of natural lighting cues that dictate shadow positioning disrupts accurate alignment judgement.",
