      "question": "Is the surface of the unicornâ€™s body uniformly smooth and reflective, resembling a glazed ceramic finish without patches of residual fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn exhibits a very smooth and reflective surface, indicative of a material like glazed ceramic. The light reflects evenly across the surface, lacking any texture or variation that would suggest the presence of fur. This uniform reflection and smoothness are characteristic of ceramic finishes, which differ from the more natural and textured appearance typically seen with fur.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mane and tail composed of thin, curved porcelain-like structures that follow the natural flow of the original hair and are securely attached to the head and base of the tail without floating or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane and tail are depicted as smooth, flowing structures that resemble porcelain. The curls are uniform and follow a natural, flowing pattern from their points of attachment, which is consistent with the depiction of hair but is stylized to appear as a solid, curved form. The material consistency and placement suggest they are securely modeled as part of the sculpture, lacking any sign of floating or separating.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the horn form a continuous, symmetrical spiral shape made of reflective metallic material, originating from the same position as the original horn and maintaining proportional size relative to the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the horn of the unicorn is a distinct, continuous spiral that reflects light, indicating a metallic surface. It originates from the same position on the unicorn's head as the original and maintains a size proportionate to the sculpture, consistent with a representation intended to mimic a realistic, yet stylized unicorn horn.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned on a flat, subtly textured stone base that contrasts with the original forest floor, with no visible remnants of trees, dirt, or foliage in the immediate surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn stands on a clearly defined stone base that is distinct from the original forest setting found in Image A. The stone base is flat with a subtle texture, designed to support the sculpture in a gallery-like setting. There are no visible elements such as trees, dirt, or foliage, reinforcing the indoor, minimalist presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the sculpture soft and directional, casting subtle highlights on the glazed surface and porcelain curls, consistent with indoor gallery illumination rather than outdoor moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is uniform and gentle, casting consistent highlights across the glossy and porcelain-like surface of the sculpture, which is typical of indoor lighting conditions found in galleries. Unlike outdoor moonlight, which often creates contrasting shadows and varied intensity, this setup uses controlled lighting to evenly illuminate the sculpture.",
