      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges and contours of the LEGO car body aligned with the original vehicle’s shape, with no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or warped sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO car features blocky edges characteristic of LEGO constructions, aligning well with the contours of the original vehicle depicted in Image A. There are no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or warped sections, as LEGO typically allows for sturdy and aligned assembly. Comparing with the original vehicle, which has smooth, continuous lines, the LEGO version represents these using block shapes that fit together. This preserves the overall shape without distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and blue translucent LEGO pieces positioned exactly where the original emergency lights were, and do they appear transparent rather than solid or discolored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, red and blue translucent LEGO pieces are situated on the top of the vehicle, mirroring the placement of the original emergency lights in Image A. These LEGO pieces are designed to mimic the transparency typical of light covers without appearing opaque or discolored, consistent with LEGO's design. The placement and appearance align with the lights on Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the window areas of the LEGO car consist of solid beige bricks without any transparent or see-through elements, making them visually inconsistent with real-world windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window areas of the LEGO car use solid beige-colored bricks, which do not allow any light passage or visuals through them, contrasting the transparent, see-through nature of real-world vehicular windows seen in Image A. This visual inconsistency is due to the use of non-transparent LEGO bricks, a common approach in LEGO models due to material limitations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grille and wheel components built from small LEGO blocks that maintain the original patterns and shapes, with no missing, misaligned, or distorted pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the grille and wheel areas of the LEGO car consist of detailed LEGO blocks that recreate the patterns and shapes of these parts as seen in the original vehicle in Image A. There are no signs of missing components, misalignments, or distortions, indicating a faithful recreation using LEGO blocks. This underscores LEGO's capacity for precision in replicating intricate designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO car resting on a flat, uniform matte gray surface with no visible seams, texture mismatches, or lighting inconsistencies compared to the car’s shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO car positioned on a flat, matte gray surface that appears uniform and seamless. There are no visible seams, texture mismatches, or lighting inconsistencies detected in relation to the shadow cast by the car. The surface reflects a controlled environment typically found in studio or digital renderings, offering a stable platform for the LEGO model.",
