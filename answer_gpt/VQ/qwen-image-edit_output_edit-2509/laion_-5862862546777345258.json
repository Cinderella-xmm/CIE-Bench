      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church façade inside the glass dome closely resembles its original architectural shape. The columns appear straight, arches are aligned symmetrically, and edges remain intact without visible distortions or breaks. This indicates a faithful miniature representation, maintaining the building's architectural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human figures in Image B are simplified pewter models due to the scale. While detailed anatomical accuracy might not be distinctly visible, the figures generally maintain natural postures without visible joint bending or limb distortion. They appear to have correctly modeled hands with a reasonable number of fingers for their scale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the baroque-style dome fully enclosing the scene without gaps, overlapping incorrectly with the church or ground, or showing seams or incomplete surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome enclosing the scene seems seamless and correctly proportioned to fully enclose the visible elements inside. No gaps or incorrect overlaps with the church or ground are apparent. The dome effectively creates a complete enclosure with no visible seams or incomplete surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B, represented as stylized glass objects, maintain discernible branch structures common to trees. They exhibit transparent, refractive qualities typical of glass, indicating realistic portrayal without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration. The refractive properties add authenticity to their glass material.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the café tables and umbrellas are scaled appropriately to the scene's miniature setting. The umbrella canopies appear circular, and the table legs are straight and evenly spaced. This consistency in shape and scaling reflects a precise miniature representation of a café scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the antique marble base display consistent veining patterns and appropriate thickness, and is it positioned directly beneath the scene without floating or clipping errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble base in Image B shows a consistent and realistic veining pattern typical of antique marble. The thickness seems appropriate for the miniature setting, and its positioning directly beneath the scene avoids any visual issues such as floating or clipping errors. This contributes to a solid and coherent miniature display.",
