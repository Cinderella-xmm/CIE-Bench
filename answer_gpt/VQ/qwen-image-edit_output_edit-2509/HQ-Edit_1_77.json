    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features and body proportions of the central figure preserved and undistorted despite the artistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the central figure's body, including the neck, arms, and torso, are consistent with what would be expected in a realistic representation. The transformation to an artistic style does not alter these fundamental proportions, indicating preservation despite the change in visual presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added Maasai motifs on the blue garment aligned with the fabric's folds and free from jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motifs on the garment are integrated smoothly with the fabric's natural folds, running in tandem with the lines and contours of the fabric. The sharpness and continuity of the motif design show deliberate placement, avoiding any disjointed or broken edges.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements on the bead ornaments emit light in a controlled manner without creating halos or color bleed onto the skin or fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing elements on the bead ornaments appear bright but controlled, as they're concentrated within the beads themselves and do not extend beyond their outline. There is no detectable color bleed onto surrounding regions such as the skin or garment fabric.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brush strokes in the background evenly applied and do they preserve the correct shapes and positions of trees, terrain, and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background displays balanced brush strokes with a focus on maintaining positional accuracy and shape integrity of landscape elements like trees and terrain. This demonstrates an attention to detail with regards to spatial layout, keeping the artistic representation coherent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bead ornaments are shown as complete and undisturbed, maintaining their structural continuity. Examination of the neck, arm, and headpiece reveals no segments appearing duplicated, missing, or distorted, thereby preserving their visual integrity.",
