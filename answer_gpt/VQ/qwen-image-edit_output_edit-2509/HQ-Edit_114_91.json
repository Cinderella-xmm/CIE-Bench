      "question": "Are the ivy formations on the hammerhead shaped like symmetrical, watchful eyes with natural leaf arrangement and no visible digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ivy is creatively arranged on the hammerhead to resemble eyes. The design is meticulous, utilizing leaves in a way that imitates organic features like eyes. There is no indication of digital artifacts disrupting this appearance; the leaves seem naturally arranged, maintaining symmetry across the hammerhead.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered bark texture cover the hammer and anvil uniformly without abrupt color shifts, patchy areas, or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hammer and anvil in Image B are covered with a texture that resembles moss-covered bark. This texture is applied uniformly, without any noticeable sudden changes in color or inconsistencies that suggest patchy or artificial patterns. The coverage appears organic and continuous, as it would be in nature.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the anvil, root-like structures extend downwards with a realistic taper, emulating how tree roots naturally grow. They are connected to the anvil's base, showing no signs of floating in mid-air or appearing disconnected, which contributes to their lifelike representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald runes in Image B are designed to appear as if they are embedded into the bark surface, demonstrating craftsmanship akin to carvings. These runes emit a soft glow that harmonizes with the bark texture. The glow is subtle, preventing harsh outlines or visible pixelation that would detract from their natural integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ivy tendrils are depicted as if they climb logically from the window frame and floor. These tendrils wrap around the hammer and anvil in a natural manner, without crossing through any solid objects. They adhere to surfaces in a realistic fashion, not appearing to float or be disconnected from the surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the transformed anvil and hammer fall consistently with the light source from the window, and do they interact naturally with the wooden table and surrounding tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to be consistent with a source from the window, casting shadows from the transformed anvil and hammer. These shadows interact naturally with the wooden table and the surrounding tools, suggesting a coherent light source and a believable environmental interaction.",
