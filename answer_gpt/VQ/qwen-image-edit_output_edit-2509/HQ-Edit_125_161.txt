    "Question": "Q1: Does the lattice-like scale pattern along the serpent's body follow the spiral curve smoothly without abrupt breaks or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body with a lattice-like scale pattern follows the spiral curve of the staircase. The scales are aligned with the natural flow of the spiral staircase, forming a continuous and coherent pattern along the serpent's lengthy body, indicating that the scales are intentionally designed to mimic the graceful motion of the staircase. There are no abrupt breaks or disruption in the pattern, demonstrating a seamless integration with the architectural element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the individual segments of the serpent's body aligned with the original stair treads such that each segment corresponds to a step in size and spacing?",
    "explanation": "In the second image, the serpent's body runs along the staircase, and each segment that resembles a part of its body corresponds with the staircase's natural breaks or 'steps.' This alignment gives the impression of the serpent naturally interacting with the steps, each segment sitting proportionately with the size of the treads and consistent spacing. This alignment mimics real-world interaction with stairs, making the integration appear well thought out.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the translucent fins extend from the original railing position in a continuous, flowing manner without gaps or distortions in their shape or placement?",
    "explanation": "The fins on the serpent's back appear to extend from the top, trailing downwards. These fins emanate from where the railing would have been, complementing the curve of the staircase. The fins themselves show a continuous flow without any apparent gaps or distortions. This flowing design supplements the serpentine motion harmoniously.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting and shading of the original staircase surface?",
    "explanation": "The serpent's marble-like texture covers its entire body, emulating the marble's unique veining characteristics seen in refined architecture. The lighting and shading on the serpent correspond to the light source evident in the staircase's original shading, creating a harmonious integration. The consistent distribution and congruence with the staircase’s aesthetic help blend the creature naturally into the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the serpent’s head positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase without overlapping or deforming the surrounding wall or ceiling structure?",
    "explanation": "The head of the serpent rises through the circular opening at the top of the staircase, fitting within this space without causing visible deformation or overlay onto the surrounding architecture. The head is positioned to fit snugly within the existing opening, respecting the spatial design and ensuring that the walls or ceiling maintain their original form without warping.",
    "answer": "Yes"
