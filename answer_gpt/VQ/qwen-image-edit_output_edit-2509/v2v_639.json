      "question": "Are the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe free from unnatural textures and maintain their structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe appear shiny and plastic, which is consistent with the expected look and feel of LEGO pieces. There is no indication of irregular textures such as distortion or misalignment. The coherent design, typical of LEGO, is maintained, ensuring the figures stay intact and recognizable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures appear undamaged and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe maintain the typical uniform and clean geometric shapes associated with LEGO pieces, such as the rounded stud connectors and angular body parts. There is no evidence of damage or inconsistency in the geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosing the LEGO scene look natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent glass cube in Image B appears clear and has refined edges, typically seen in acrylic or glass display cases. There are no unnatural distortions or visual artifacts that disrupt the visual integrity of the cube. This characteristic upholds the expectation of a transparent enclosure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the scene properly highlight the intricate details of the LEGO minifigures and the glass cube without causing any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's lighting highlights the details accurately without causing reflections or glares that obscure the objects within the scene. The LEGO minifigures and the glass cube are well-lit, and the details remain distinct and unobstructed by the lighting, which is crucial for maintaining scene visibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the scene's earthy and natural tones without introducing unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B transitions smoothly from dark to light shades, complementing the natural tones of the LEGO figures and not interfering with their texture or detail visibility. This seamless background design aids in drawing focus to the objects without introducing unintended textures.",
