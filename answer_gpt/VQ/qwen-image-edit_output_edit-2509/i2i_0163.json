      "question": "Does the outdoor camping scene seamlessly integrate with the toasters, maintaining consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toasters in Image B are set in an outdoor camping scene with natural lighting. The sunlight appears to be coming from one direction based on the highlights on the toasters and the shadows on the grass and table. The shadows cast by the toasters on the table are consistent with this light source, suggesting a well-integrated scene. The lighting on the toasters and the environment appears cohesive, indicating that they coexist naturally within the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the toasters placed naturally on the folding table without any visible distortion in the table's texture or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are placed on a black folding table. The table's texture and structure appear consistent, with no visible distortions or unnatural bending where the toasters sit. The legs of the table are also properly aligned, and the toasters rest flat on the surface, indicating a natural placement.",

      "question": "Do the sunlight effects on the toast create realistic highlights and shadows on both the toast and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunlight in Image B highlights the top parts of the toast, creating bright spots that suggest direct light exposure. Similarly, shadows are cast on parts of the toast and on the toasters, consistent with the observed outdoor lighting conditions. These effects appear realistic and match the general lighting across the scene.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements smooth, without any noticeable artifacts or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition in Image B between the foreground elements (toasters and table) and the outdoor camping background is seamless. There are no noticeable artifacts or abrupt edges that suggest a poorly done edit. The focus and depth of field are well maintained, allowing for a natural flow from the foreground objects to the background scenery.",

      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the toasters remained intact and physically plausible in the new outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toasters in Image B retain their proportionate and realistic shapes when placed in the outdoor camping scene. The size in relation to the table and the surrounding objects appears consistent with a typical toaster's dimensions, maintaining physical plausibility in the new environment.",
