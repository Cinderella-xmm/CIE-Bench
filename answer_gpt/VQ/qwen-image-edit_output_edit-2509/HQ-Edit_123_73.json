    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the pyramidâ€™s steps transformed into armored segments with consistent thickness, alignment, and geometric integrity, without visible breaks or unnatural warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pyramid's steps appear to have transformed into a series of textured, armored-like segments, resembling dragon scales that consistently cover the structure. These segments fit coherently into the design, maintaining geometric integrity and alignment. There is no visible distortion or unnatural bending, which suggests a well-integrated architectural transformation in line with the creature-like element draped over the pyramid.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the entrance at the top of the pyramid replaced with an eye-like structure that matches the stone material and scale, without abrupt texture changes or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an eye-like blue energy structure at the top of the pyramid which contrasts sharply with the stone material, unlike typical architectural elements. This feature does not match the stone's natural texture or scale but instead stands out as a supernatural addition with a luminous quality, which also suggests floating rather than being integrated with stone material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and foliage surrounding the pyramid transform into vine-like scales that follow natural growth patterns and maintain consistent texture and lighting, without unnatural sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding trees and foliage have transformed into mystical, dragon-like scales that follow a natural, spiral pattern harmonizing with the surrounding environment. These scales are integrated naturally, maintaining consistent lighting and texture. There are no abrupt changes or disconnected patches, which allows for a seamless and organic appearance in the fantastical context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are ancient stone patterns preserved and integrated into the base of the pyramid-creature, maintaining continuity with original carvings and avoiding mismatched or floating decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the pyramid in Image B is adorned with intricate, ancient-style stone patterns consistent with the Aztec or Mayan motifs that may have existed in the original structure. These are well integrated into the new design, maintaining continuity with the original carvings and avoiding any sense of mismatch or floating decorative elements. The patterns align with the cultural theme that the transformed pyramid represents.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminescent plants around the base emit soft, localized light that interacts realistically with the environment, without overexposed areas or unnatural color spillage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent plants emit a gentle, localized glow that interacts with the surrounding environment naturally. The light softly illuminates nearby textures without causing overexposition or visible color spillage. This creates an ethereal, magical ambiance consistent with the fantasy theme of the image, blending color and shadow effectively.",
