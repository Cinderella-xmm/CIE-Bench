      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the image, such as the elephant and its environment, unaltered and maintain their original natural appearance without any artifacts introduced in the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements do not include an elephant; instead, we see a dish artfully arranged with food items, which means that significant edits have been made compared to the typical natural appearance involving an elephant's environment. This disparity clearly indicates that elements are altered, as an elephant is absent, replaced by a culinary setup.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the elements within the image appear natural and consistent with the original, such as the roughness of the elephantâ€™s skin and the details of the hay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements are entirely different from what would depict an elephant and its environment. The textures of food items, such as the smoothness of a plate and the glossy finish of sauces, replace the expected rough skin of an elephant or the fibrous detail of hay. Thus, the textures in the edited image are not consistent with what would be natural in the original context involving an elephant environment.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical features of the elephant and its surroundings, like the hay bale and enclosure, depicted accurately and without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a culinary arrangement with ingredients, which replaces the natural setting of an elephant and its environment. This means there is a significant change in what is depicted, and elements like an elephant, hay, or enclosure cannot be assessed for realistic proportions since they do not exist in this visualization.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the subtle lines and wrinkles on the elephant's skin and the strands of hay, been preserved without any degradation or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not actually include an elephant or hay, but instead a plate with food creatively arranged, the details one would expect, like wrinkles on elephant skin or the texture of hay, are entirely absent and replaced by smooth and diverse visual textures of a culinary nature. Thus, the original details are not preserved.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the placement of the elephant, the hay bale, and the enclosure, maintain visual credibility and alignment with the expected scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's composition is completely different, showcasing a food arrangement instead of an animal and enclosure setup. Hence, elements such as an elephant, hay bale, and any form of enclosure cannot be accounted for or align with those expected in an original scene with these features.",
