    "Question": "Q2: Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal footprints are analyzed by observing their arrangement and spacing. The prints appear to be randomly placed rather than following a coherent path indicative of movement from the giraffe toward the edge of the room. Additionally, the depth and spacing do not seem to match typical animal gait patterns, indicating that they are more decorative than representative of motion.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the giraffe retain its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation?",
    "explanation": "A comparison between the giraffe in both images is made by focusing on its proportions and texture. In Image B, the giraffe maintains a similar proportion and soft fabric texture compared to Image A. There is no visual evidence of stretching, flattening, or seams that seem unnatural, indicating that the transformation has preserved the original characteristics of the giraffe plush toy.",
