      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the cat’s body is depicted using thick, bold lines that uniformly follow the natural shape of the cat. These lines do not have any distortion or breaks, ensuring a well-defined silhouette. This approach is often used in posterized or vector art illustrations where clear delineation between subjects and backgrounds is desired.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses appear in a flat orange color, lacking any reflective qualities, gradients, or textures. The shape and position are consistent with the cat’s face, indicating a stylized approach where simple color fills are used. This common technique in vector or pop art removes realistic detail to highlight bold shapes and colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a significant transformation of the background into solid color blocks. The sky, ocean, and sand appear as distinct red, blue, and yellow areas respectively, without any natural gradients or textures typical of a realistic scene. These solid fills are characteristic of simplified, stylized art forms where emphasis is placed on vibrant color usage rather than detailed realism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness lacks any realistic texture and instead uses gradient fills to convey its form. Similarly, shadows beneath the cat are not reflective of natural light and instead consist of gradient colors. This technique shifts the focus from texture and realistic depth to stylized gradient fills, commonly seen in various digital art styles.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation includes rendering all major elements such as the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background in primary colors—red, blue, and yellow. No other colors are introduced, adhering to a specific color palette that simplifies the image while highlighting key features. This technique is popular in artworks that aim to use high contrast and simple forms.",
