      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO-style minifigure in Image B is designed to emulate the subject's professionalism by adopting a standard pose with a focus on simplicity typical of LEGO figures. The facial features are represented by a standard LEGO face without expression, maintaining a calm demeanor. The posture is upright, typical for a LEGO figurine, which conveys professionalism and calmness. Given the LEGO theme, which inherently lacks detailed facial features, the minifigure maintains the demeanor appropriately without any unnatural distortions.",
