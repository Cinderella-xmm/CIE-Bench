    "Question": "Q1: Are the metallic textures added to the camera body natural, maintaining the camera's structural coherence without visible artifacts or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the camera body has been augmented with metallic textures that align with the steampunk aesthetic, characterized by bronze and brass elements. The details on the camera body, such as buttons, dials, and surface textures, are preserved and coherent with the original design. These textures do not exhibit any disjointed artifacts or compromise structural integrity, indicating a well-integrated design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
