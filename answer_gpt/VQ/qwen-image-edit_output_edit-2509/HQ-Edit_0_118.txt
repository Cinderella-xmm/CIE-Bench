    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges and transitions of the woman's clothing, hair, and facial features smooth and consistent with watercolor rendering, without jagged lines or unnatural texture breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transition of the woman's clothing and hair is rendered in a watercolor style, characterized by soft and flowing edges. There are no visible jagged lines or unnatural texture breaks, which is consistent with the typical qualities of watercolor art. The smooth transitions and consistent texture are indicative of careful artistic rendering in this style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the elongated drape sections of the robe follow natural gravitational flow and maintain consistent fabric thickness and fold patterns without appearing stretched or floating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe's drape sections follow a natural downward flow that aligns with gravitational pull, consistent with how fabric would naturally hang. The thickness and pattern of the folds remain consistent and do not appear stretched or unnatural. The robe's structure looks coherent and balanced, adhering to the physics of fabric.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the botanical patterns on the robe evenly distributed, aligned with the fabric weave, and blended naturally with the surrounding colors without visible seams or repetition artifacts?",
    "explanation": "On Image B, the botanical patterns are evenly spaced across the robe and seem to be integrated naturally into the fabric, aligned with its texture. The design merges smoothly with the robe's coloring, and there are no visible seams or repetition artifacts disrupting the pattern. The continuous and intentional placement of these features complements the garment's design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the leaf outlines within the book pages clearly defined, proportionally scaled to the page size, and integrated without distorting the book's spine, edges, or page curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf outlines inside the book are clearly defined and scaled appropriately to fit the page size. They are integrated into the page without causing any distortion to the book's spine, edges, or curvature. The structure of the book remains accurate, indicating the thoughtful placement of these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the added sun rays originate from a logical direction relative to the tree canopy and cast soft glows and subtle shadows that match the depth and density of the surrounding foliage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sun rays appear to emanate from a direction consistent with the position of the tree canopy. The rays provide a realistic glow that affects the scene with soft lighting, and the shadows they cast correspond to the density and structure of the surrounding foliage. This attention to lighting detail enhances the depth and dimension of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the border positioned uniformly around the image edge, containing subtle literary symbols (e.g., books, quills), and does it not obscure or distort any part of the main subject or background?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a border uniformly placed around the image edge, incorporating subtle literary symbols such as ornamental designs reminiscent of books or quills. This border does not interfere with or distort any part of the subject or the scenic background. It frames the image without diverting attention from the main content.",
    "answer": "Yes"
