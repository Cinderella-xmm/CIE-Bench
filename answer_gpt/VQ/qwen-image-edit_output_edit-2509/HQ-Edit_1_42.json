      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cartoon version of the man have correctly proportioned limbs, five fingers per hand, and natural joint angles without bending or elongation errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon version simplifies the details compared to real life to capture essential features. Common sense suggests five fingers per hand and natural limb proportions are typical for human depictions even in stylized art. Here, the man is depicted sitting on a bench with visually straight limbs, indicating natural joint angles typical of someone sitting. His legs are crossed, which is a normal position. There are no visible exaggerations or distortions in limb proportions, suggesting the depiction follows typical human anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the swirling leaves positioned in a way that follows logical airflow paths and do not intersect or pass through the manâ€™s body or bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaves are swirling around the man, depicting an autumn scene. Common knowledge suggests that leaves in the wind tend to swirl and move around obstacles and do not typically pass directly through solid objects like a bench or person. Observing the positioning, the leaves are placed in a manner that suggests airflow around the man and bench, without intersecting or appearing to pass through them, which is consistent with the depiction of natural leaf movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree canopies and foliage display consistent color distribution and intact branching structures without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a simplified, stylized representation of tree branches framing the page. While the style is minimalistic, the branches are consistent in color and form, with smooth edges and no visible breaks or misalignments. In stylized representations, simplification of detail is typical, however the visual elements remain aligned and coherent, indicating an intentional aesthetic choice.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cream-colored paper background uniformly textured and do the tree branch motifs lie flat without distortion, clipping, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a paper background with tree branch motifs, colored in a consistent cream tone. The texture appears uniform, typical of artistic rendering styles for sketchbooks or coated paper, and the branches are depicted without distortion or unnatural shadows, maintaining a flat application that fits within the aesthetic constraints of the cartoon style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the elements (man, leaves, bench, paper border) arranged within clear margins and aligned symmetrically or logically to suggest a bounded page layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays elements within a supposed sketchbook page layout. The man is centered on the bench, with swirling leaves and tree branches that fit harmoniously within the margin indicated by the book fold. The symmetry of the objects suggests a deliberate alignment to create balance and focus in a bounded page layout, typical for organized illustrations in a book.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all surfaces (clothing, skin, leaves, paper) rendered with consistent sharpness and texture detail without jagged lines, smudging, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cartoonish representation, where simplification can lead to less texture detail than in realistic imagery. However, the consistency in sharpness across clothing, skin, leaves, and paper shows no signs of jagged lines or smudging, typical for well-executed artwork. The texture detail appears evenly applied within the style constraints, indicating careful rendering to maintain quality.",
