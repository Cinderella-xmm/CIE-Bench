      "question": "Does the chibi-style parrot maintain smooth feather textures and proportional body parts without visible warping or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style parrot's feathers appear smooth and consistent with no visible pixelation or distortion. The body parts, such as wings and beak, are proportionally balanced, which aligns with stylized character design practices where proportions are exaggerated but remain coherent. This indicator suggests careful digital rendering without artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the oversized leaves around the branch proportionally larger than surrounding foliage without appearing stretched or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows oversized leaves intentionally being larger, consistent with stylized art forms where certain objects are exaggerated for aesthetic effect. The shapes of the leaves are smooth without distortions, maintaining a natural appearance despite their exaggerated size, suggesting intentional design rather than error.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal beads on the leaves appear as clear, spherical droplets with subtle reflections and no visible digital artifacts or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal beads appear distinctly spherical with very clear reflections, indicative of high-quality digital rendering. There are no digital artifacts or smudging, which implies detailed and polished graphic work ensuring clarity and realism within the image's stylized context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the explorer positioned on a separate branch at a believable distance and scale, with correct limb orientation and no distortion in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explorer in Image B is positioned on a branch next to the parrot. The scale of the explorer is consistent with the miniature theme present in the image, and the body parts appear correctly oriented and proportioned as per stylized miniature design principles, with no distortion. This maintains the integrity of the visual composition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the glass dome feature a consistent wood texture with etched tribal patterns that blend naturally into the rainforest setting without sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the glass dome has a wood texture that appears consistent and smooth. The etching patterns are clear and integrate seamlessly with the stylized rainforest setting. There are no sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies, suggesting careful design and rendering consistent with artistic depictions of such scenes.",
