      "question": "Are the cutout windows on each tier aligned with the chocolate drops and have smooth, uninterrupted edges without jagged or fragmented borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cutout windows on the chocolate packaging are triangular and evenly spaced across the surface. They are properly aligned with the sections containing nut pieces, indicating a careful design and placement. The edges of these cutouts are smooth and continuous, showing no jaggedness or fragmentation, implying a high-quality design. Comparison with Image A further shows that Image B maintains consistency in design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gold foiling applied across the surface show uniform reflectivity and smooth transitions without visible seams, pixelation, or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold elements border the chocolate and are used to accentuate the design. The gold foiling displays a uniform sheen and consistent color without any apparent seams or pixelation. The transitions between the chocolate and gold are smooth, and the reflective effect is even and harmonizes with the overall aesthetic. No overly bright spots disrupt the appearance, indicating a well-executed design. Comparison with Image A reveals a similar balance and absence of any flaws, suggesting high-quality editing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nut embellishments attached to the chocolate surface with natural positioning, showing correct shadows and depth, and no floating or misplaced instances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nuts appear embedded in the chocolate sections through the window cutouts. The shadows created are consistent with natural lighting, giving a sense of depth and realistic attachment to the chocolate surface. There are no instances of nuts appearing to float or being out of place, which conveys a properly conceived and executed design. Comparing this with Image A reveals Image B to be consistent in maintaining realism in nut positioning.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sparkle effects evenly distributed and faint enough to resemble light reflections on chocolate, without forming clusters or sharp, unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sparkle effect is subtly applied across the chocolate regions, lightly enhancing the warmth and luxe of the appearance. The sparkles are evenly distributed and do not concentrate in distracting clusters or form harsh highlights that seem unrealistic. This subtlety complements the design rather than overwhelming it, maintaining a natural aesthetic. Upon comparing with Image A, both images demonstrate an organic distribution of sparkle effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the new text “ChocoConifer Delights” clearly readable, properly spaced, and integrated into the base without overlapping or distorting the surrounding chocolate ring or motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'ChocoConifer Delights' is prominently displayed at the base of the chocolate design. It is clear and legible with well-proportioned spacing between letters, integrating seamlessly with the base without interfering with the chocolate's curves or decorative motifs. There is no distortion or overlapping evident, indicating careful attention to textual placement. This contrasts slightly with Image A, where it appears the emphasis was on maintaining legibility while integrating text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the tiers of the tower evenly spaced and aligned vertically, preserving the original conical shape without bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiers that form the conical shape of the chocolate design are symmetrically arranged and evenly spaced, maintaining the vertical alignment essential for the tower's conical presentation. The perspective shows no signs of bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles as all tiers maintain consistent proportions, reinforcing the overall structural integrity and visual appeal. Comparing this to Image A, Image B effectively preserves the uniformity and structural alignment.",
