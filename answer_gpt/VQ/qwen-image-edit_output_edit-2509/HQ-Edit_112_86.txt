    "Question": "Q1: Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the main body of the teapot is visually transparent, with reflections and refractions consistent with glass material. There is no sign of metallic residue; the transparency allows the light to pass through and creates reflections and refractions typical of clear glass. This observation, combined with world knowledge about the properties of glass, supports that the main body is indeed clear glass.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The floral patterns on the teapot's glass surface in Image B appear uniformly frosted, indicating smooth craftsmanship. They show no signs of smudging or uneven opacity typical of imperfect frosting processes. The absence of artificial texture artifacts supports a uniformly frosted design. Considering the common styles of etched or frosted glassware, the patterns seem consistent and well-executed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the handle and spout show a consistent amber tint, transitioning smoothly across their surfaces. The gradient is even and without abrupt changes, and the edges are sharp with no color fringing or unnatural highlights. This result suggests a carefully applied color and finish, which aligns with quality glasswork knowledge.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the objectâ€™s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?",
    "explanation": "The reflection underneath the teapot in Image B is symmetrical and aligns well with the object's base. The contours in the reflection accurately mimic the teapot's shape, and the transparency effects are realistic. These observations, when corroborated with knowledge about reflective properties on glossy surfaces, confirm the accuracy of reflection alignment and clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparing Image B with Image A, the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body appear consistent, without any evidence of distortion such as stretching or compressing. The elements maintain their relative sizes and alignments, indicating that the image preserves the original proportions. Observations of distortion or misalignment, which would be evident through visual discrepancies, are absent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
