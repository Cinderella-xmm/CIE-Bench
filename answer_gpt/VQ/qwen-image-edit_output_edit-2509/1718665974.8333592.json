    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic textures appear realistic due to the detailed reflection and shadowing on the brass gears and armor pieces. The alignment of these elements shows no visible gaps or misaligned edges, suggesting precise and consistent shapes typical of well-crafted armor. The logical symmetry and coherence of these elements indicate a skilled design, reflecting world knowledge on quality craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clockwork wings in Image B are symmetrically positioned on both sides of the character. The mechanical joints and gear patterns are visible and appear to follow logical engineering principles, suggesting structural coherence. There are no signs of warped or broken geometry, indicating a well-executed design that aligns with principles of symmetry and mechanical engineering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face is not integrated into the glowing orb; the orb appears to be a separate element that does not have visible clock features. This suggests that the elements are distinct, and the glowing orb retains its shape and texture without distortion. Hence, the characteristic described in the question does not match the observed elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background cityscape in Image B presents detailed brass towers with identifiable architectural features, consistent with a steampunk theme. The airships are thoughtfully arranged in the sky with plausible positioning relative to the towers. The consistent lighting and shadowing, augmented by a sepia tone, enhance the three-dimensional effect and ensure no elements appear floating or disconnected.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tone is applied consistently throughout the image. Visible details in the character's clothing, mechanical elements, and the background cityscape are preserved, with careful attention to contrast and coloration. This coherence ensures that the critical features are highlighted without any fading, discoloration, or contrast loss, contributing to the image's overall aesthetic appeal.",
