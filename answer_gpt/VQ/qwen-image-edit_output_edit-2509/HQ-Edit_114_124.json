      "question": "Does the unfurled scroll form of the map maintain smooth, continuous curvature without jagged edges or distorted grid lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scroll's edges appear smoothly rolled and continuous, avoiding any jagged or irregular shapes. The grid lines on the map maintain their alignment, without distortion, suggesting a precise and careful enhancement of the scroll layout. This is evident from examining the structure of scrolls, which are commonly unfurled in a continuous roll form. Thus, the curvature appears appropriately smooth.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spokes of the ship's wheel evenly spaced, structurally intact, and consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the original compass material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be a ship's wheel is the compass, which retains its structural integrity and material consistency. Compared to Image A, the compass-like object retains its metallic texture, and the layout of the spokes (the compass points) seems evenly spaced and maintains thickness similar to the original compass material seen in Image A, ensuring visual consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explorers are shown as small silhouettes, effectively scaled in proportion to the map, signifying their place within a travel-themed narrative. Their placement along a travel path marked by red dots suggests a journey, ensuring they are likely positioned along plausible, historical travel routes. The explorers do not obscure key geographical labels, as they are carefully situated to respect the mapâ€™s detail, aligning with typical considerations of map illustrations where human figures are used to dramatize historical exploration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography aligned with the vintage aesthetic, free from pixelation or blurring, and positioned so that it does not obscure major elements such as the compass or continental outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in Image B, set prominently at the top, 'The Voyage of Discovery,' is styled to maintain a vintage feel, consistent with the theme. It appears clear and well-rendered, without pixelation or blurring. The placement of the text does not interfere with the major elements, such as the compass or outlines of continents, ensuring legibility and unobstructed visibility of the map details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red dotted lines in Image B form a continuous path across the map, visually suggesting an exploration route. They are carefully drawn to align with plausible historical exploration paths, avoiding overlapping landmasses or key symbols on the map. This design decision helps maintain the integrity of the map's geographical imagery while signifying historical navigation paths that explorers might have taken.",
