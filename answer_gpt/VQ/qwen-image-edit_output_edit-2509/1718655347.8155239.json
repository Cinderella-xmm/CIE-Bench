      "question": "Are the golden threads on the moon evenly distributed and seamlessly integrated into the circular shape without visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted with stylized embroidery featuring golden threads. The threads are distributed around the circular shape of the moon, creating a distinct artistic style that resembles sun rays. These golden threads appear to be evenly distributed and are well-integrated into the circular outline of the moon. There are no visible breaks or distortions in the embroidery pattern as per typical embroidery art standards, which ensures a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the interlocking geometric shapes on the mountain peaks align properly with the original ridge lines and maintain consistent scale and depth without floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks are decorated with geometric shapes created from golden threads. These shapes are interlocked into the design of the mountains. Based solely on Image B, the geometric shapes appear to be well-aligned with the original mountain outlines. The interlocking patterns follow the contours and ridges of the mountains accurately, maintaining a consistent scale and depth. There are no floating or disconnected segments in the pattern, providing a coherent and well-integrated design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the embroidery patterns on the red trees aligned with their original positions and shapes, and do they display consistent thread density and direction without visible flaws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict red trees; it focuses on golden and silver embroidery designs within a natural landscape, suggesting a shift from realistic depictions to a symbolic or abstract artistic style. Consequently, there are no embroidery patterns for red trees to analyze for alignment or consistency, as the artistic rendition omits such elements entirely.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the silvery-blue silk strands follow the natural curvature of the water body and show smooth transitions between sections without abrupt changes in thickness or direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water body is represented with intricate embroidery using silvery-blue silk strands. These strands are carefully crafted to follow the natural flow and curvature of the water, simulating the natural movement of a water body. The transitions between sections in the embroidery are smooth, with a consistent thickness and fluidity, avoiding any abrupt changes that would disrupt the visual coherence of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water all share a consistent artistic style and lighting response without creating visual dissonance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cohesive visual composition where different elements like the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, and silk-water adhere to a unified artistic style characteristic of embroidery. The artistic elements are harmoniously integrated, sharing a consistent use of lighting and design. The embroidery's style—characterized by its intricate stitching and uniform color palette—ensures that each element complements the others without causing visual dissonance, resulting in a coherent overall aesthetic.",
