      "question": "Are the guitar and microphone depicted in a chibi-style 3D design while maintaining their original shapes and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar and microphone appear to have been transformed into a 3D rendering, but they do not exhibit the exaggerated proportions or simplified features characteristic of chibi-style designs. Instead, they maintain realistic shapes. World knowledge of chibi style indicates that it often includes oversized heads and smaller bodies or features, which is not the case here. Therefore, the transformation retains more of a realistic 3D look rather than a chibi style.",

      "question": "Does the floral arch with soft pastel tones blend naturally with the scene, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral arch is designed with soft pastel tones and appears to integrate well with the setting. The petals and leaves are smooth and consistent with what would be expected in a digital or staged floral design without evident digital artifacts or unrealistic textures. This suggests a seamless blending into the scene, supported by uniform lighting and visual consistency in world knowledge of digital graphics.",

      "question": "Are the rose petals scattered across the floor visually credible and consistent with the lighting and shadows in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rose petals in Image B are scattered across the floor and appear to be appropriately scaled and shaped in alignment with the rest of the scene. The lighting on the petals corresponds with the overall direction of the light source, ensuring the shadows fall naturally on the floor, which is consistent with real-world expectations of how light behaves in a setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the modified lighting create a warm, intimate ambiance without introducing unnatural highlights or shadows on the guitar, microphone, and other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and creates a warm atmosphere, typical of an intimate setting. There are no harsh or unnatural highlights or shadows visible on the guitar, microphone, or other elements such as the amp and floral arch. This consistency in lighting suggests a professionally executed scene, adhering to the principles of lighting design in 3D environment rendering.",

      "question": "Do the guitar and microphone retain their structural consistency and visual credibility despite being transformed into chibi-style 3D designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "As previously noted, the guitar and microphone are rendered in a 3D style in Image B, but they remain realistic rather than taking on a chibi style. Thus, they retain their structural consistency, indicating skillful rendering while maintaining visual credibility. Chibi-style typically alters proportions significantly, which is not observed here as the proportions have remained true to their real-world counterparts.",
