    "Question": "Q1: Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?",
    "explanation": "In the provided edited image (Image B), there are no spectacles visible on the bear, so there is no issue of deforming fur or reflections. The question may be hypothetical or does not apply based on the current image content.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",
    "explanation": "The edited image does not exhibit any added aging features such as wrinkles in the bear's facial expression. The rendering of the bear's facial area appears smooth and lacks unintended distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
    "explanation": "The speech bubble in the left panel of Image B is clearly positioned above the bear, connected to its mouth through a tail-like extension. It doesn't obscure or distort the nearby fur details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
    "explanation": "The transformation chart in the right panel of Image B depicts the life cycle of fish and does not appear within the bear's mouth; it is shown within the water beneath the fish. The chart's positioning is unrelated to the bear's anatomy.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
    "explanation": "The transformation chart is illustrated with the fish's life stages aligned horizontally in an underwater setting. However, the absence of explicit shadows or depth cues means the chart's integration with the river surface lacks depth consistency with the scene.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
    "explanation": "The fact box is placed near the bottom of the chart in the right panel, away from critical elements like tree trunks or the active area of the river. It is effectively positioned to not interfere with key details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The text in both the speech bubble and the fact box of Image B has clean edges and presents no apparent pixelation or aliasing artifacts, indicating clear rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
    "explanation": "The hues in the edited image appear consistent with the overall color grading of a natural forest scene. The blue hues in the water and brown-green tones in the background do not deviate significantly from a natural setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bear’s fur and the water splashes maintain their visibility and detail, with the added speech bubble and transformation chart not obstructing these features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?",
    "explanation": "Both panels in Image B are appropriately situated in a format that fits within the frame, without any cut-off of significant features such as the bear's legs or the tree line, maintaining full compositional integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
