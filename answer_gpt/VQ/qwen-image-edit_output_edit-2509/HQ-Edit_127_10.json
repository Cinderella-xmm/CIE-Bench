    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains two distinct tiers: the upper tier with buildings, including the Eiffel Tower, and the lower tier with trees and a park-like setting. There is a glass dome separating these two tiers, creating a clear and visible layer division. The perspective and scaling appear consistent as the Eiffel Tower and accompanying structures fit well within the confines of the globe, and the separation between the sky and ground within makes the separation more evident. The separation suggests a deliberate layered structure, contributing to a cohesive and proportionate representation in a confined space.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in the upper tier of Image B, including the Eiffel Tower, appear to have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients. These effects mimic the appearance of metallic surfaces reflecting light, which generally enhances the realism of the scene. There are no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches, allowing the image to maintain depth and a sense of light interaction across the structures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and bushes in the lower tier of the snow globe exhibit irregular shapes and varying densities and heights, closely resembling a natural park setting. They do not display repeating textures or symmetrical patterns which is typical for artificial arrangements, suggesting a deliberate design choice to simulate a natural and organic environment. The variation in shape and form adds to the authenticity of the lower tier's appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silvery flakes within the snow globe in Image B are scattered throughout the space between the upper and lower tiers. They have soft edges, slight blurring, and their opacity varies, suggesting depth and movement. This mimics the appearance of snowflakes wafting through the air inside a snow globe, thereby enhancing the scene's three-dimensional depth and dynamic quality.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B is depicted with detailed cobblestones, each individually rendered with visible grout lines and surface variations, adding to the realism and texture of the structure. Moreover, the street lamps are proportionally sized and are evenly spaced along the path of the lower tier, contributing to an orderly and aesthetically pleasing design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower depicted inside the snow globe maintains structural integrity with correct lattice patterns expected from the well-known design of the landmark. The scaling across the Eiffel Tower is uniform, with no visible indications of sections that are stretched or compressed. These factors contribute to an authentic representation that matches the known architectural structure of the real Eiffel Tower.",
