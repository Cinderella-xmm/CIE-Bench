      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or visible edges where the forest background was replaced with the city balcony and skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a city skyline with a noticeable transition from the original forest setting in Image A. To assess unnatural textures, we examine the edges around the bird and perch to ensure seamless integration into the new cityscape. There are no visible edges or unnatural textures indicating that the editing was clean and precise.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bird and the branch it stands on blend well with the city balcony setting, maintaining their structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is noticeably perched on the railing of a city balcony, which differs from the branch in Image A. To evaluate blending quality, we consider the bird's positioning, shadowing, and interaction with the railing. Although the bird and original branch are now depicted on the balcony, their presence remains visually cohesive with the setting without distorting structural consistency.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the texture and structure of the branch remained intact and undistorted after replacing the forest background with a city balcony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comparison, Image A shows a branch in a natural setting, whereas Image B replaces the branch with a city balcony rail. As a result, the branch itself is not present or preserved in Image B, meaning there is no distortion of the branch structure since it has been fully replaced.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and relative sizes of the bird, branch, and city skyline appear physically plausible and natural in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the bird on a city balcony railing with an urban skyline background. To assess plausibility, we consider the relative size of the bird against the balcony and distant skyline. The bird's proportion to the balcony and skyline appears consistent with real-world scale, ensuring a physically plausible and natural composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shadow play on the bird, branch, and cityscape match naturally, contributing to the overall realism of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows similar warm light casting on the bird and balcony, resembling the effects from Image A's woodland light. The cityscape background in Image B appears consistent with this lighting, suggesting a harmonious and natural lighting integration into the scene, contributing to realism.",
