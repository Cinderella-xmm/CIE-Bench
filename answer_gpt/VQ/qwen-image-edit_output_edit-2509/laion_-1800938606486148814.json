    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent upper material of the shoe features clean and smooth design lines without signs of pixelation or jagged edges. The opacity doesn't have inconsistencies and maintains a uniform appearance across the entire surface, typical in high-quality digital renderings where attention is given to material effects. This conclusion is drawn from observing the seamless transition of colors and patterns, which is a common characteristic of well-rendered digital designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neon blue glow around the Swoosh evenly distributed with smooth transitions and no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into neighboring surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon blue glow surrounding the Swoosh appears to be evenly distributed, maintaining a smooth gradient without abrupt color changes or leakage into adjacent areas. This effect suggests a well-executed rendering process, where lighting effects are uniformly applied and isolated to the intended design elements, avoiding any unintended light spread.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital screen on the strap properly aligned with the strapâ€™s curvature, showing clear and stable animation content without pixelation or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the digital screen integrated into the strap aligns precisely with the curvature of the strap. The animation content displayed is clear and crisp, absent of pixelation or visual noise, which indicates careful consideration in the design to ensure clarity and stability of the digital elements within the contours of the shoe design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the digital shoe box exhibit consistent geometry and metallic reflection patterns without warped edges or misaligned holographic layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the digital shoe box that does not have distinct representation in comparison to Image A, which is purely a comparison of two overall shoe designs. However, observing the materials and reflective surfaces of the shoe in Image B, the consistent geometry and accurate depiction of metallic reflections signify a well-rendered image without warping or misalignment present visually.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the shoe box evenly spaced and aligned with the surface contours, without repeating anomalies or misregistration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there isn't a traditional shoe box, the geometric patterns outlining the shoe itself are meticulously applied. The patterns conform to the shape and structure of the shoe seamlessly, without showing irregularities or misalignment, which is typical in a properly executed digital render where all design elements maintain harmony with the product's physical dimensions.",
