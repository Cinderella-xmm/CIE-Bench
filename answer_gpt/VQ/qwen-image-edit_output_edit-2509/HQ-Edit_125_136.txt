    "Question": "Q1: Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted in a simplified cartoon style, typical for illustrations aimed at explaining complex topics in a more digestible manner. The helmet, suit segments, and life support pack are illustrated with smooth lines and shapes consistent with the conceptual forms they represent. They retain the essential geometric structure associated with astronaut suits, such as a round helmet, segmented body suit, and rectangular life support pack, all without visible jagged or broken edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spacesuit is depicted without detailed texture, as is typical for simplified, cartoon-like illustrations meant to emphasize broad concepts or actions rather than precise physical details. The absence of detailed textures means the focus is on clarity of form and function. Therefore, the simplified texture is uniform and free of any unnatural patterns or artifacts, aligning well with illustrative intents.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the accent gold colors are thoughtfully used to highlight specific textual elements and design accents such as step headings and certain parts of the representation of the space station. The colors are well-defined and do not bleed into unrelated areas, serving to draw attention and distinguish these elements without compromising overall image clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronautâ€™s limbs or the station structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the directional arrows are prominently displayed between the steps, showing a clear movement from one element to the next. They are straightforward and do not interfere with or overlap the illustrated astronaut's limbs or the structure of the space station. This effectively communicates the sequence of actions without causing confusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the text 'Step 1: Prepare, Step 2: Navigate, Step 3: Operate' at the bottom edge of each frame for clarity, without overlapping any significant parts of the Moon or ISS. The text is easily readable, with a clean presentation that is free of distortion or shadow effects, serving its purpose of providing additional information without distraction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
