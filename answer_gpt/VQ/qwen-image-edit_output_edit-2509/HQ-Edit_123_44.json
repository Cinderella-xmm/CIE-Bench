    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case appears smooth and clear with no visible scratches or distortion. There are visible reflections, but they are natural and consistent with a glass surface. These observations result from the combination of visual observation and common knowledge regarding the characteristics of high-quality glass display cases.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather accents and brass corners appear to have realistic textures and respond well to the lighting, indicating they are accurately rendered materials. The seams are not visible, and there are no floating effects, which suggests that the materials are properly attached and portray a cohesive design. This analysis combines visual detail with the understanding of how such materials should appear in high-quality renderings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved emblem on the display case in Image B is clearly defined, with reasonable depth and shadowing. However, it does not blend naturally into the glass surface as the emblem is attached to the leather portion of the case, not the glass. The detailed analysis combines visible cues from the image and the typical presentation of emblems on a stand or base rather than directly on glass.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds inside the glass case in Image B are visually separated from the aircraft, and appear with soft, volumetric textures that do not exhibit clipping or unnatural transparency. The observation combines visual cues of separation and realistic cloud representation, understanding the typical attributes of miniaturized cloud effects in display settings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the propellers are depicted with motion blur that suggests rotation, and they are properly aligned with the engine nacelles with no deformation or clipping against the display case. This reasoning derives from recognizing motion blur effects common in rotating aircraft components and observing their alignment and interaction within the scene.",
