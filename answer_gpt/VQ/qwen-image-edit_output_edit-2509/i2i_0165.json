      "question": "Does the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo appear smooth and well-integrated without any unnatural edges or blurring around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo is assessed for integration into the overall image. The placement and size of the logo are balanced with the refrigerator's surface area. Observing the edges, there are no visible artifacts, blurring, or pixelization, suggesting that the integration was executed with precision. The logo matches the sharpness and clarity of the surrounding elements, creating a smoothness that makes it look like a natural part of the refrigerator.",

      "question": "Is the custom label on the top shelf placed appropriately, without distorting the surrounding items or creating visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The custom label is located at the top part of the refrigerator in Image B. Examination of its placement shows that it fits well without any spatial distortion. The label doesn't overlap with any existing items on the shelf nor does it lead to any visual imbalance in its vicinity. It appears naturally integrated without interfering with or altering the perception of nearby objects.",

      "question": "Are the texture and details around the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label consistent with the rest of the refrigerator's surface, avoiding any noticeable loss or alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the consistency of texture and detail around the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label is assessed. The surface of the refrigerator maintains a uniform appearance, with no notable differences in color or texture where the text is integrated. This consistency helps the text to appear as though it was part of the original design, suggesting no noticeable alterations or mismatches due to the edit.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label maintain appropriate scaling relative to their surrounding elements, appearing neither too large nor too small?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Checking the proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and custom label in Image B reveals that they are well-balanced relative to their environment. The sizes are appropriate and in harmony with the dimensions of the refrigerator and shelf. The scaling appears natural, avoiding dominating the scene or being too diminutive, which contributes to their authentic look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shadowing on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label correspond logically to the light source, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment of lighting and shadowing on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label in Image B shows that they align with the overall lighting within the refrigerator. Light appears to be emanating from the interior lighting of the fridge, and the logo and label reflect this by not casting unnecessary shadows or having inconsistent lighting, thus appearing naturally integrated without drawing unwarranted attention.",
