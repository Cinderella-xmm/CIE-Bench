      "question": "Does the white chiton with gold accents on the woman’s body show natural fabric folds and lighting consistency, without visible pixelation, texture repetition, or unnatural stiffness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white chiton with gold accents in the edited image appears to be well-rendered, with natural fabric folds that suggest movement and texture. The lighting on the fabric is consistent with the warm tones of the environment, avoiding pixelation and texture repetition. The fabric drapes naturally around the woman's body, and there is no visible stiffness, which suggests that it was carefully crafted to mimic a realistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the classical Greek-style waves and laurel leaves in the woman's hair consistent in shape, density, and lighting with the surrounding environment, and do they avoid unnatural clumping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the waves and laurel leaves are depicted in a manner that complements the Greco-Roman theme of the attire. The shapes are consistent with well-known motifs from classical Greek art, maintaining a density that allows for a cohesive integration into the woman's hair. The lighting matches the golden tones of the sky and landscape, avoiding any appearance of clumping or floating that might detract from the classical aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the trees and animals in the background retain recognizable forms while being rendered in a golden, stylized manner consistent with classical Greek pottery art, without distorted proportions or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows trees and animals stylized in a manner reminiscent of classical Greek pottery art, characterized by golden hues and simplified forms. The proportions of the trees and animals are maintained, and their appearance is cohesive with classical art styles, avoiding any distortion or fragmented geometry. This contributes to a harmonious backdrop that supports the scene's classical theme.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky rendered with coherent cloud formations and directional lighting that matches the overall illumination of the scene, avoiding artificial seams or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in the edited image features dramatic cloud formations consistent with the lighting direction, which originates from the halo effect of the sun. The shading of the clouds integrates seamlessly with the overall scene, with no visible seams or inconsistencies that would indicate artificial rendering. The illumination complements the warm palette of the scene, enhancing the atmospheric depth.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands and feet anatomically correct, with five fingers per hand and natural joint positioning, and does her posture reflect plausible human motion without deformation or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's hands and feet appear anatomically correct, with each hand having five fingers and positioned in a graceful manner. Her joints are naturally positioned, reflecting plausible human anatomy. Her posture, with one hand raised and the other gently holding the fabric, reflects fluid motion that is anatomically sound, without signs of deformation or unnatural stretching.",
