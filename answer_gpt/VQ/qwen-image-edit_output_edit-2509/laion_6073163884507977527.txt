    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome encloses the entire scene, including the house, trees, and ground. Based on common sense, transparent glass usually allows for clear viewing without distortion unless intentionally designed otherwise. The scene elements appear to retain their original proportions and positions under the dome, indicating no distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?",
    "explanation": "Visual analysis of Image B shows pathways formed by mossy green areas that follow the contour of the landscape, connecting different elements and blending seamlessly with the surrounding ground textures. World knowledge suggests pathways should appear integrated with the terrain to maintain natural aesthetics, and the image confirms such blending.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the appearance of the shrubs matches well with existing vegetation, sharing similar sizes, shapes, and texture. Based on common horticultural knowledge, consistent scaling and texture are crucial for visual harmony. The shrubs fit into the scene in a visually coherent manner, suggesting consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the lake with clear edges and a reflective surface. The reflection provides depth and interaction between the lake and surrounding elements, such as the bridge and greenery. Common sense dictates reflections enhance realism in water surfaces, and their presence indicates correct positioning and integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B features fairy lights arranged to follow tree branch shapes, emitting a gentle, uniform glow across the scene. Generally, well-placed lights should complement shapes and provide soft illumination, which these fairy lights accomplish. Their even distribution without bright spots indicates proper light placement and effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the bridge span the lake with stable supports and connect directly to the ground on both sides without floating or tilting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bridge is anchored to the ground on both sides of the lake, appearing stable and level. Bridges must visually connect to their terrain to appear functional and stable. The bridge's integration into the scene without signs of floating or imbalance corroborates this principle.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) rendered with materials and lighting that match the rustic, natural aesthetic of the original scene?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows added elements, such as the dome, lake, bridge, and lights, incorporated into the scene with materials and lighting that complement a rustic atmosphere. Consistent use of texture, color, and illumination maintains the original aesthetic. Within context, these features adhere to a harmonious design strategy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
