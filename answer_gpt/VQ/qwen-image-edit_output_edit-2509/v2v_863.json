      "question": "Does the chibi-style elephant maintain its identifiable traits like tusks and large ears without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style elephant is depicted as a cute, cartoonish version of an elephant which typically retains recognizable features such as large ears and tusks. From the visual cues, the elephant has large, floppy ears and visible tusks, and these features are consistent with how elephants are generally represented in a simplified or cartoonish style. Therefore, there are no unnatural distortions seen in the key features of the elephant.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the elephant's skin accurately represented in the chibi-style 3D rendering without any loss or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi-style 3D rendering of the elephant, the skin appears smooth and lacks the intricate texture that a real elephant has, which is typical for this style focused on simplicity and cuteness. This choice does not translate to a loss or unnatural appearance since the chibi style inherently does not strive for hyper-realism, focusing instead on exaggerated form and features that convey character simply and endearingly.",

      "question": "Do the earthy hues and organic textures on the cereal box appear natural and consistent with the theme of environmental harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box in Image B features a green and brown color scheme with a design that implies connection to nature, using earthy hues that often symbolize environmental themes. The presence of text and visual design elements like plants and a globe-toting elephant suggests practicality for a nature-oriented product. The image composition, therefore, aligns well with the concept of environmental harmony.",

      "question": "Does the chosen environment (rustic kitchen countertop or market stall) complement the cereal box and chibi elephant mascot without any visual inconsistencies or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The environment appears to be a rustic or naturalistic setting, suitable for a cereal product emphasizing nature and harmony, with wooden elements that add warmth and authenticity. It provides an organic backdrop that complements the green and brown theme of the cereal box and chibi elephant mascot. The cozy and homey aesthetic is consistent, with no visible inconsistencies or distortions observed in how the elements are combined.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi elephant, cereal box, and environment maintained without any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the chibi elephant, cereal box, and the surrounding natural environment are balanced and coherent. The scaling of the elephant to the cereal box is plausible given the cartoonish context. No visual distortions are present; the elements feel integrated cohesively with realistic spatial positioning. The depiction remains charmingly exaggerated yet believable within the stylistic guidelines of chibi rendering.",
