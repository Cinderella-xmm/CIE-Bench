      "question": "Does the lighting on the man and the pineapple appear consistent with the new aged blackboard background, without introducing unnatural shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting remains warm and consistent on both the man and the pineapple, matching the tones of the aged blackboard background. The warm, directional lighting highlights the texture of the pineapple and contours of the man's coat, offering a harmonious and natural blend with the blackboard's surface. This suggests a careful editing process where shadows and highlights were adjusted to ensure consistency across the objects and background in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural edges where the man and the pineapple meet the new aged blackboard background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the transition between the man, pineapple, and the blackboard appears smooth and well-integrated. There are no visible artifacts or harsh edges where these elements meet, indicating that the edited background was carefully placed behind the main subjects. The precision in this blending supports the notion of a professional and meticulous editing process in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the chalk-written equations and galactic sketches on the new blackboard background integrate naturally with the man and the pineapple, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, the chalk equations and galactic sketches are visually balanced and well-positioned relative to the man and the pineapple, maintaining a coherent structural relationship. The style and placement of the chalk drawings provide a cohesive thematic element that complements the foreground subjects without appearing disjointed. This seamless integration suggests thoughtful compositional planning and execution in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the proportions and details of the man and the pineapple been preserved, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the man and the pineapple retain their realistic proportions and intricate surface details. The texture of the man's coat and the pattern on the pineapple's skin appear crisp and clear, indicating that the scale and finer elements have been preserved in the editing process. This suggests an accurate and detail-oriented approach in maintaining the integrity of the original subjects in the edited version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the texture of the new aged blackboard background complement the man and the pineapple, without introducing any unnatural or conflicting textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an aged blackboard background that enhances rather than conflicts with the texture of the man and the pineapple. The matte finish and subtle visual noise of the blackboard align with the overall aesthetic, ensuring coherence in the imageâ€™s texture palette. This indicates that careful consideration was given to choosing a background texture that would complement rather than clash with the primary subjects.",
