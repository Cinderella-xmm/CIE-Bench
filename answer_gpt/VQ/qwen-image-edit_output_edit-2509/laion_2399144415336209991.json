      "question": "Are the enhanced beads on the bride's shoulder straps evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the fabric's surface without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the bride's shoulder straps are consistently styled with a cartoon look, appearing evenly spaced and following the curvature of the straps without noticeable detachment or unnatural sharpness. The beads maintain a cohesive and smooth alignment with the fabric, which is typical in cartoon illustrations where details are simplified yet retain their integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged lapel of the groom's suit proportionally consistent with the rest of the jacket, and does it retain a smooth edge without jagged lines or distorted angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lapel of the groom's suit is proportionally consistent with the cartoon style, reflecting the overall design and structure of the jacket. The edges are smooth, with no visible jagged lines or distorted angles, which is common in cartoon representation where clean lines are used to maintain a streamlined appearance.",

      "question": "Do the hands in the \"holding hands\" pose have five fingers each, correctly aligned joints, and natural skin texture without distortion or overlapping limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style simplifies the physical attributes but maintains the necessary anatomical structure such as five fingers. The joints align naturally and there is no distortion or overlap, which is characteristic of well-executed cartoon designs where anatomical accuracy is retained in a simple form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped border is designed to encase the cartoon couple neatly without intruding upon their bodies or garments. The gold trim and floral engravings are clearly defined with distinct lines and no blurring, supporting the clear definition expected in cartoon art styles.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonized features of both the bride and groom exhibit uniform styling, with consistent line work and shading that seamlessly integrate their depiction. The transitions in texture are smooth, which is typical as cartoons aim to harmonize all elements within a scene.",
