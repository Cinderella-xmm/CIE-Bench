    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal shards appear to be sprouting from the cactus, well-aligned along the ribs, and spaced out evenly. They do not cluster or overlap, maintaining a uniform distribution that follows the natural form of the cactus. This alignment suggests a deliberate and organized placement, possibly enhancing the visual appeal and emphasizing the cactus's geometric structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
    "explanation": "The glyphs on the cactus in Image B closely adhere to the rib lines, creating a structured arrangement that respects the cactus's geometry. The glow is soft and coherent, ensuring the glyphs remain clear and legible against the cactus surface. There is no excessive brightness that causes overexposure or halo effects, maintaining a balanced illumination throughout the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal is depicted as resting on a sandy desert surface, not a wooden surface. The pedestal appears fully grounded, with no visible edges that suggest floating or clipping. This suggests a seamless integration into the environment, which provides a stable foundation for the cactus pot.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
    "explanation": "The amber eyes in Image B are symmetrically placed near the center of the cactus, embedded naturally along the ribs. They exhibit internal illumination, giving lifelike quality without warping or distorting the surrounding cactus tissue. This careful integration maintains the structure's visual integrity while adding an intriguing, mystical element to the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
    "explanation": "The vine tendrils in Image B wrap around the pedestal and extend gracefully downwards, showcasing a natural curve. They connect seamlessly to both the pot and the base, adhering to natural growth patterns without appearing as if they are floating or unnaturally rigid. This presentation conveys a lifelike quality, suggesting a realistic interaction between the plant elements and their environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
