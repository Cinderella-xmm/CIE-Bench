    "Question": "Q1: Does the creature added to the image appear naturally integrated with the temple and surrounding jungle, without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, what could be perceived as a creature does not exist. Instead, there is a decorative frame and text. The temple structure and jungle appear as the main focus, without any creature visible. Therefore, the integration question regarding a creature does not apply as no creature is present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the creature's design reflect the temple's shape and textures accurately, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distorted geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B centers on a temple structure surrounded by a jungle and features a decorative vase or capsule in the foreground. There is no creature design present in Image B that needs to match or mirror the temple's shapes and textures. The question is not applicable in this case because the creature is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature's feet visually consistent with the temple's architectural details and natural elements, without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
    "explanation": "The focus in Image B is on a temple and surrounding jungle, along with a decorative orb or capsule in the foreground. The orb's design contains intricate patterns and coloration, which harmonize visually with the temple and jungle setting. No creature is present to compare elements at its feet, but the orb itself seems consistent with the overall theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the addition of the creature and the custom-designed orb maintain the scene's overall authenticity and natural appearance, without disrupting the harmony of the jungle and temple setting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the emphasis is on the temple, jungle, and a decorative orb or capsule. There is no creature included in this scene. The capsule and the temple appear well-integrated into the jungle setting, maintaining harmony without appearing out of place or disruptive.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the creature's invented name and elemental type displayed clearly beside or beneath it, without interfering with the visual quality or introducing any distracting elements?",
    "explanation": "The text 'INVENTED NAME' and other descriptors are present in Image B and are displayed below the temple and above the orb. There is no creature visible; instead, the decorative text exists in a separate visual space below the illustrative elements, suggesting context or detail without interference in visual quality or creating distractions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
