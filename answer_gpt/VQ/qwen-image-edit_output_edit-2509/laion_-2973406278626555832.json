    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Panel 1, the background is illustrated in a typical laboratory setting, with scientific equipment displayed. In this cartoon illustration style, depth and lighting are indicated through shading and the positioning of objects. Since illustrations often emphasize certain elements for clarity, slight abstraction doesnâ€™t imply inconsistency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not clearly depict the vape device being held in a natural angle or proportion, as it's an illustration not concerned with depicting hand-holding realism. Visualizing accuracy in hands holding the device is incomplete here compared to Image A, showing a real-world hand grip.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Panel 1, the cartoon style depicts the vape device with intentional simplicity, which may not reflect real transparency or surface reflections. The primary focus seems to be educational, so details like pixelation and reflections are abstracted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The components in Panel 2, while simplified, do appear in a layout indicative of typical vape device internals. Components and paths are logically outlined, and though simplified, they maintain plausible connections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels, the text bubbles are strategically placed so they do not interfere with key graphic elements such as facial features or important details. Text follows a logical reading direction typical of comic style, maintaining clear readability.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a hand holding the vape device; it focuses on the illustration of the vape device and its components. Thus, the illustration inherently lacks this detail, making comparison with Image A disengaged from representation realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clean boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, with no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B) there is no photographic figure depicted. The panels are entirely illustrated without reference to a different medium like photography, ensuring consistency within the cartoon's illustrative style.",
