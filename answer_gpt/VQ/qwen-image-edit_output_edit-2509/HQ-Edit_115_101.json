      "question": "Does the cylindrical glass body maintain consistent curvature and transparency, with the embossed patterns clearly visible and proportionally scaled across the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a rectangular bottle with embossed patterns on its surface. The patterns are clearly visible, and the curvature of the bottle seems consistent with no apparent distortion. The transparency of the glass is well-maintained, allowing the patterns and the liquid inside to be seen clearly, indicating proportional scaling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the label \"Timeless Reserve\" centered within the circular area, with Roman numerals uniformly positioned along its perimeter and matching the font style and size of the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label 'Timeless Reserve' is precisely centered within a circular area. The Roman numerals are uniformly positioned around the perimeter of the circle. Both the font style and size appear to match those in Image A, creating a coherent design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top ring now resemble a functional bottle cap with a cork stopper that has a natural porous texture, and are the gold accents seamlessly integrated without visible seams or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bottle cap design with a gold ring and a cork stopper. The cork appears to have a natural porous texture, typical of cork materials. The gold accents on the cap are seamlessly integrated, with no visible seams or lighting inconsistencies, which enhances the realism of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental scrollwork patterns preserved with full depth and clarity across the curved glass surface, showing no signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental scrollwork patterns on the glass surface are preserved with detailed depth and clarity. They are consistently visible throughout the bottle, with no signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation, indicating careful attention to maintaining quality during the editing process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glass bottle align with the lighting direction of the scene, and are there no visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities at the boundaries between the bottle and the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass bottle with reflections and shadows that are aligned with the lighting direction, consistent with the shadows on the background wood. There are no visible seams or ghosting, and the boundaries between the bottle and wood are smooth, indicating a seamless integration into the scene.",
