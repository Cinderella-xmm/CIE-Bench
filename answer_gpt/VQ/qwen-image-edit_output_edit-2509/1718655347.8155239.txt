    "Question": "Q2: Do the interlocking geometric shapes on the mountain peaks align properly with the original ridge lines and maintain consistent scale and depth without floating or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks are decorated with geometric shapes created from golden threads. These shapes are interlocked into the design of the mountains. Based solely on Image B, the geometric shapes appear to be well-aligned with the original mountain outlines. The interlocking patterns follow the contours and ridges of the mountains accurately, maintaining a consistent scale and depth.

Consequently, there are no embroidery patterns for red trees to analyze for alignment or consistency, as the artistic rendition omits such elements entirely.",
    "answer": "No"
