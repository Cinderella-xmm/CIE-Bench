      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all six dolls proportionally scaled with consistent body structure, showing no distorted limbs, oversized heads, or irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls depicted are of varying sizes intended to illustrate the concept of nesting dolls. The proportions such as the head size in relation to the body and no distorted or uneven limbs are standard for nesting dolls. They maintain a consistent body structure suited to their design without irregular shapes or oversized features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all six dolls clearly display the original figureâ€™s beard, headwear, and distinctive robe patterns in a simplified but consistent manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls shown do not display features like the beard, headwear, and robe patterns that are evident in the traditional style image of the original figure. Instead, they have simplified facial features characteristic of dolls without such specific traits.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the dark-wood desk textured realistically with visible grain, proper shadows, and correct scale relative to the dolls, and is it fully grounded beneath them without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The desk has a visible dark wood texture and grain, which gives it a realistic appearance. The scale is consistent with the size of the dolls, and the placement is well-aligned, showing the dolls resting on the desk without any indication of floating.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the robes on the dolls exhibit smooth, curved folds consistent with a breeze, without jagged lines, unnatural stretching, or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls exhibit painted designs characteristic of traditional nesting dolls, rather than fabric robes that would exhibit folds. There are no jagged lines, unnatural stretching, or broken textures due to their painted nature.",

      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls depicted do not include physical hands with fingers but are painted figures commonly found on nesting dolls. Therefore, the question about fingers doesn't apply to the form represented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls exhibit a consistent application of the orange and blue colors typical of traditional nesting dolls. The colors are uniform across the doll figures, without any visible bleeding, mismatched tones, or gradients.",
