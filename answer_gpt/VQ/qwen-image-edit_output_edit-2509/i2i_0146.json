      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image of the zebra shows a stylized, cartoon-like representation rather than a realistic one. Its stripes are more uniform and simplified compared to a real zebra. Real zebras have varied stripe patterns that are more intricate. In this stylized depiction, the stripes are consistent with cartoon art style but not with natural patterns one would find on a real zebra.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the zebra is depicted in a cartoon style which often stylizes features to be more expressive or exaggerated. The ears are upright, but the overall style is not naturalistic. Comparing to a real zebra, the representation in the edited image lacks realism, yet maintains a straightforward upright position consistent with cartoon imagery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a zebra in a cartoon style with exaggerated features, such as larger eyes and a more compact body compared to the natural proportions of a real zebra. While the limbs and body are proportionate within the cartoon context, they do not reflect realistic zebra proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a smooth coat texture typical of digital or cartoon art, free from pixelation or artifacts. While this texture is not realistic in the sense of mimicking a real zebra's coat with all its natural variations, it fits perfectly into the stylized, clean aesthetic of the cartoon design presented.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the environment around the zebra is part of the cartoon depiction. The ground is a flat, single color, indicating it is not meant to represent natural grass but rather a stylized background element typical of cartoons. There are no artifacts, but it does not maintain a natural appearance as it aims for a different artistic effect.",
