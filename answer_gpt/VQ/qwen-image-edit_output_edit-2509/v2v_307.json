        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style bandage inside the packaging appears to have a consistent and coherent structure.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the realistic bandage outside the packaging shows detailed fabric and adhesive surface textures. The image showcases clear textures without any visible digital artifacts, which contributes to a lifelike depiction of a bandage. The details in the texture support a high-quality visual presentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the packaging design, including the isometric perspective and the label \"HEALING ESSENTIALS,\" integrate naturally into the scene without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The isometric perspective of the packaging in Image B appears well-integrated into the scene. The label 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is placed neatly, and the overall design maintains coherence with typical product packaging visuals, providing a natural and believable appearance, without any distortions or strange angles that might disrupt visual credibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the chibi-style bandage within the packaging logically consistent with the realistic bandage outside, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both the chibi-style bandage inside the packaging and the realistic bandage outside, their proportions and placement appear logically consistent. The chibi bandage is depicted in a stylistically exaggerated form typical of chibi figures, while the realistic bandage's dimensions and form remain true to life. This comparison suggests a deliberate design choice rather than any distortion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials for both the packaging and the realistic bandage in Image B are depicted in a way that is consistent with their intended purposes. The packaging material looks like standard box material, and the realistic bandage shows appropriate textures and colors. Both elements appear free from any unnatural artifacts, ensuring they look plausible and fitting for their uses.",
