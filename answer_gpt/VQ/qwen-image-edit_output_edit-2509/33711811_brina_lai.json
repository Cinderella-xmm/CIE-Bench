    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the jagged wing structures formed from the mountain peaks have smooth transitions between rock and ice, and do they follow the natural slope and ridge lines without abrupt geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks have been transformed into large, feather-like wing structures. The transition between the rock and ice is replaced by a new texture simulating feathers, and even though it retains some flow to resemble natural slopes, these wings do not maintain a consistent transition typical of natural geographic features. The geometric shape of the wings contrasts with natural mountain formations, suggesting abrupt modifications.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale-like patterns on the lake surface uniformly spaced and reflective, with no visible repetition, pixelation, or mismatched light reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake surface is transformed into a pattern of scale-like textures that are reflective. These scales are arranged uniformly and consistently without repetition or pixelation issues, maintaining a fluid reflective quality that aligns with a reflective water surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the peninsula resemble a continuous, tapering tail with natural curvature and surface texture, and are there no sudden breaks or unnatural bulges in its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peninsula is transformed into a winding tail formation. It maintains a natural, smooth curvature and surface texture that resembles the flow and gradual tapering of a snake's tail, without unnatural breaks or bulges disrupting its shape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the house structures reshaped into a linear metallic spine that lies flat on the ground with consistent material shading and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house structures are not transformed into a continuous linear metallic spine. Instead, they appear intact without significant reshaping or transformation into a spine formation, indicating no such alterations as described.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the cloud eyes have clear, symmetrical pupil and iris structures, and are they seamlessly integrated into the existing cloud layer without visible borders or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formations incorporate large eyes with pupils and irises. The eyes are clear and symmetrical, and they blend seamlessly into the surrounding cloud forms, avoiding visible borders or color discontinuities, which gives them an integrated appearance within the existing cloud layer.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the grass fur consistently aligned in a single direction across the field, with natural-looking flow and no clumped or artificially drawn streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what once was the grassy field seems to be transformed into a fur-like texture with a consistent direction across the area. It suggests a uniform structure akin to flowing fur without clumping or streaking that might appear artificial.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, duplicated textures, or lighting mismatches between the transformed elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, fur) and the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while several elements are transformed, such as scales, wings, and fur, the integration is quite seamless within this newly crafted environment. There are no obvious seams or duplicated textures, and the lighting appears to be consistent with the overall scene, indicating careful blending of these elements into the image.",
