      "question": "Do the pastries in the edited image maintain their original shapes without distorted or stretched forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastries, including the cookies, galettes, and madeleines, appear to have maintained their original shapes. By analyzing Image B, these pastries retain their round and oval forms without signs of distortion or stretching, as common sense would dictate that pastries should have consistent, specific shapes to appear appetizing and recognizable. Therefore, the pastries seem to be in their intended shapes.",

      "question": "Are the bread slices' internal textures clearly visible and consistent with real bread, or do they appear overly stylized with uniform patterns that lack natural variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread slices exhibit a uniform texture with clearly defined edges and lack the natural variation typically found in real bread. The internal textures appear overly stylized, as seen by their consistent color and pattern, deviating from the common expectation of natural variations such as grain or holes one would typically observe in actual bread. Thus, they appear stylized.",

      "question": "Do the muffin liners show clear geometric patterns that still align with the shape of the muffins and do not float or detach from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the muffin liners display clear and colorful geometric patterns. These patterns align with the shape of the muffins, covering their bases and sides, which suggests proper attachment to the muffins. The visual consistency between the liners and muffins indicates that they do not float or detach and maintain a coherent connection.",

      "question": "Is the checkerboard pattern applied uniformly across the tray surfaces without breaking the perceived depth or causing unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the checkerboard pattern is applied uniformly across the tray surfaces. The pattern follows the contours and edges of the trays, maintaining a consistent flow without taking away from the trays' perceived depth or creating an unnatural flatness. This application relies on observed uniformity and seamless integration of the pattern with the tray structure.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract shapes in the background positioned in a way that matches the depth and alignment of the original cup stack, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, abstract shapes form a colorful background, but they bear no resemblance to the alignment and logical depth seen in the cup stack from Image A. Instead of reflecting logical alignment or matching depth, they form a separate and unaligned background feature. These abstract patterns do not mimic the cup stacks' positioning or contribute to depth alignment, indicating a divergence from the original alignment concept.",
