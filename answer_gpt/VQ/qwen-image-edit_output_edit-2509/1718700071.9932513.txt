    "Question": "Q1: Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "The curls in the hair are detailed with consistent marble texture, which showcases natural variations in depth and surface detail. The marble rendering technique implies a careful attention to material consistency, avoiding artifacts like blurring or inconsistent shading, which would be noticeable if present. Based on the analysis of the visible curls, no such artifacts are apparent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "The ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders appear to maintain anatomical alignment with the central figure's musculature. The carvings flow seamlessly along the natural contour of the torso, without noticeable gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions. This observation is based on the visual symmetry and coherence within the marble design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "The angelic figures are depicted with clear outlines that are consistent with the overall theme and design. Their proportions appear natural and coherent relative to the central figure, maintaining depth through the sculptural representation in marble. There is no visible distortion or fragmentation, supporting a well-rendered background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
    "explanation": "The image is uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette consistent with marble sculpture, featuring smooth gradients that capture the shading typical in marble. There are no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas, which suggests that the conversion to monochrome is complete without artifacting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "Both hands of the central figure display exactly five fingers each. The fingers are articulated with natural joint representation and realistic proportions, capturing the anatomical accuracy expected in marble sculptures. There are no signs of fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending.",
    "answer": "Yes"
