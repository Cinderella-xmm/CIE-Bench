      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the elephant have clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the glass display case has clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections, observe the visual cues indicative of high-quality glass. The edges should appear uniform and straight. Reflections, if any, should be consistent with the environment and show no signs of distortion, such as wavy lines or inconsistent curves. From Image B, the case appears to be well-crafted with neat and smooth edges, and any reflections are appropriate and natural. Therefore, through visual checks combined with knowledge of how high-quality glass behaves, the case does not exhibit any unwanted artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the metallic resin details on the elephantâ€™s armor consistently textured and reflective, showing no unnatural glossiness or broken patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the armor in Image B involves inspecting the texture and reflective qualities indicative of metallic resin. Consistency across the armor implies even texture, which means patterns should not appear jagged or irregular. Natural reflectiveness should allow light to bounce in a manner akin to metallic surfaces without exaggerated gloss that could suggest artificial editing. Reflectivity showing varied depths rather than flat surfaces further suggests a realistic appearance. The armor in Image B exhibits these qualities, with no breaking in patterns or gloss inconsistencies, suggesting that the resin details are well-rendered.",

      "question": "Are the silk-gold banners located at the four corners of the glass case, properly anchored, and displaying natural fabric draping and color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating the silk-gold banners involves checking for realistic textile draping and color shifts. Silk typically hangs easily, conforming to gravity, and its color appears rich and deep, shifting slightly with light angles. In Image B, the banners appear connected neatly at four corners, visibly hanging with natural folds consistent with silk. Their color shows natural variation, not appearing flat or monotone. Using knowledge of fabric behavior and light interaction principles, the banners achieve realistic visual anchoring and variation.",

      "question": "Do the layered mountain silhouettes in the background show gradual opacity and depth, with no sharp edges or inconsistent transparency levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Depth perception in layered mountain silhouettes is determined by the gradual transition of opacity and smoothness of edges. Natural landscapes show gentle fades and graduations due to atmospheric perspective, where distant objects appear less defined. In Image B, the mountains exhibit such gradual layering. No sharp edges or abrupt transitions occur, and transparency balances opacity shifts tangible in natural settings. This analysis corroborates understanding of visual depth in landscapes, and demonstrates realistic portrayal of mountains.",

      "question": "Are the bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges realistically integrated into the rocky surface, with natural leaf textures and root placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For realistic tree integration, note the placement of roots wrapping or resting upon surfaces in a believable manner. Leaf texture should mimic real foliage, without pixelated or unnatural outlines. Observation of Image B reveals the trees fitting gracefully upon the rocky base, roots seemingly connected with the ground. Leaves maintain smooth edges, showing verdant details indicative of true plant textures. The seamless integration relies on understanding of natural horticultural patterns and recognizable vegetation traits.",
