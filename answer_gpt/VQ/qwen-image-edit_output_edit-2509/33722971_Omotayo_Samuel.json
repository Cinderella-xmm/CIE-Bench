      "question": "Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features added to the suitcase, such as eyes, appear proportionate and harmoniously integrated onto the suitcase surface. The features follow the general shape of the suitcase without causing any visible distortions. Considering the recognition of faces and objects, these features are placed in a way that respects the structure of the suitcase, preventing unnatural appearances.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure have five fingers per hand, with natural hand shape and joint alignment, and no anatomical deformities or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the figure's hands appear to possess the normal count of fingers with natural alignment in terms of shape and joints. No visible signs of anatomical deformity or missing limbs are present, given common human characteristics related to hand structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture applied smoothly across all surfaces without visible seams, repetition, or unnatural lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there appear to be no indications of velvet texture, as the materials consist mostly of leather and other surfaces. The application of textures, given their non-velvet nature, seems consistent and smooth without visible seams, unnatural lighting, or texture repetition. Velvet typically has a distinct appearance, and no such texture is visible here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the world map backdrop properly aligned with the scene’s perspective and does it integrate seamlessly without warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The world map in Image B integrates effectively with the scene's perspective, maintaining proper alignment without warping or clipping. The map's design follows a curved projection that suggests a globe, fitting the cabinet or display case in which it is mounted without transition faults. Scene setting and angles often dictate such perspective adherence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the display case fully enclosing the scene with correct proportions, no clipping of elements, and realistic glass transparency or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case properly encloses the scene elements, including the figure and suitcases, without any noted clipping issues. The proportions adhere to expectations of a display case design without overlap faults, and glass elements exhibit transparency and reflections typical of real-world glass cases.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all fine details (e.g., stitching, hair, texture edges) preserved and free from blurring, ghosting, or pixelation after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the fine details such as stitching on clothing and details on the suitcases and figure appear clear and well-preserved without visible blurring or pixelation. Hair texture and other meticulous components retain clarity, indicative of high-quality editing that maintains sharpness and detail orientation.",
