    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?",
    "explanation": "The metallic texture on the packaging is depicted with a smooth and consistent gradient of colors, indicating a thoughtful application of highlights and reflections. This suggests careful attention to the light source direction, as the gradation simulates the reflective properties of metal rather well. The absence of patchiness or overly shiny areas points to the skilled use of visual effects to enhance realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scannerâ€™s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?",
    "explanation": "The holographic display is executed with an effect that highlights the edges and layers, giving it a 3D appearance that aligns well with the shape of the scanner. It features depth and translucency, setting it apart from an ordinary 2D overlay. This helps maintain harmony and alignment with the scanner's design, lending a futuristic feel to the packaging.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "The grid lines observed in the packaging display consistent spacing and orientation, contributing to a cohesive design. They run parallel to the edges of the scanner and packaging, forming unbroken patterns. The smoothness and uniformity of these lines indicate an absence of digital artifacting such as jagged edges or interruptions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?",
    "explanation": "The tech-themed icons and branding on the packaging are distinctly visible, properly scaled, and placed carefully. They appear in corners and sides of the packaging without interfering with essential scanner features like the control panel or paper path. This placement minimizes visual clutter and maintains the functional clarity of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?",
    "explanation": "The transformed packaging mirrors the original scanner's dimensions and spatial relationships well, keeping the components like the paper feed slot and control panel in proportion. This alignment suggests adherence to the scanner's physical design, avoiding distortion or misalignment, thus preserving the product's functional integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
