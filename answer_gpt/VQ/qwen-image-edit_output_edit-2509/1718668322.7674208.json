      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the shoulder and chest armor are rendered with a metallic sheen that accurately reflects light, contributing to a sense of depth and realism. The light reflections are consistent with how light would naturally interact with polished metal surfaces, showing gradients of brightness and color. This avoids any appearance of flatness or excessive shininess that might result in an unnatural look.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The joint areas of the armor in the edited image appear to align well with the underlying anatomy of the body. There are no noticeable geometric distortions or unnatural gaps that would disrupt the continuity of the armor or indicate misalignment. This suggests careful attention to maintaining anatomical accuracy in the armor design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic hair strands in the edited image are depicted as continuous and flowing, with each strand maintaining consistent color gradients and reflective properties. The strands do not appear to break or clump together unnaturally, contributing to a realistic and coherent appearance that mimics how metallic wires would behave.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image appears as a uniform and neutral gray tone. There are no visible remnants from an original setting or any inconsistencies in the lighting, providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that focuses attention on the main subject without distraction.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the transitions between the armor, hair, and background are smoothly integrated. There are no visible artifacts such as pixelation or mismatched edges that would disrupt the overall cohesiveness of the image. This seamless integration contributes to the polished and professional appearance of the edit.",
