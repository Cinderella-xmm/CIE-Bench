    "Question": "Q1: Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the tabletop features a gear-like surface with intricate engravings and patterns consistent with the steampunk aesthetic. The metallic sheen is uniform across the surface, and the details are crisp and well-defined with no visible blurring or jagged edges. This observation stems from the clear visibility and consistent detailing, typical of high-quality steampunk design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the piston-driven limbs are evenly distributed around the central column, demonstrating symmetry typical in engineered structures. The limbs appear proportionally scaled to fit the steampunk theme, with joints clearly defined. There are no apparent bent or broken segments, indicating a robust and intact structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, steam vents are visible along the column, evenly spaced and integrated into the central structure. They appear properly embedded, aligning with the aesthetics of a well-engineered steampunk design, without signs of detachment or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows cog patterns and dials on the base, crafted with precision and intact geometric shapes. The spacing is uniform, and the details are complete without overlapping or missing parts, reflecting careful design in line with typical steampunk machinery aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the design includes brass and copper accents distinct from the silver metal due to their unique color and reflectivity. The differentiation is clear and consistent with no unnatural gradients or texture artifacts, adhering to typical steampunk styling that contrasts different metals.",
    "answer": "Yes"
