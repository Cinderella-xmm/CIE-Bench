    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wings display a smooth, translucent gradient resembling flowing water without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are designed to resemble flowing water, contributing to a fluid and smooth aesthetic. World knowledge about the appearance of flowing water suggests that such elements should transition smoothly with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or banding, maintaining a sense of motion and grace, similar to natural water or transparent materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scales on the dragonfly’s body evenly distributed, aligned with its natural segmentation, and do they exhibit smooth color transitions without abrupt edges or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict a dragonfly but a humanoid creature with a scaly texture. The scales appear to be well-placed, smoothly transitioning in color, suggesting a thoughtful design aligned with the natural segmentation of a scaly creature. This consistency and smooth transition are visually coherent with world knowledge of how scales should appear on a similar creature.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their spherical shape and contain layered, dark blue internal structures that suggest depth, without appearing flattened or unnaturally textured?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the humanoid creature in Image B has blurred face details, common design choices for eyes in art and symbols suggest their spherical nature with intricate internal structures to depict depth. As such, this answer cannot be accurately determined without visual evidence.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the aquatic vines wrapped around the dragonfly’s legs in a continuous, non-intersecting manner, with a soft glowing edge that does not bleed into surrounding areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of wrapped vines is noted around the humanoid's form. These vines are visually continuous and maintain coherence without intersecting improperly, with glowing edges that blend smoothly without bleeding. This aligns with general artistic principles for depicted vines or similar tendrils.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist evenly diffused around the dragonfly, fading gradually into the air without sharp edges, clumping, or unnatural brightness spikes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mist surrounding the humanoid figure appears to be evenly distributed. It seems to gradient naturally into the environment, avoiding sharp edges, clumping, or unnatural brightness, which is visually consistent with how mist typically interacts with surrounding areas in an artistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the reflection in the water accurately depict the edited dragonfly’s features, including wings, body patterns, and vines, with appropriate distortion and reduced brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the water depicts the humanoid figure and its extended features. This reflection includes an appropriate distortion and a subtle adjustment in brightness as typically seen in water reflections. There is no dragonfly in this image, but the principles of reflection remain consistent.",
