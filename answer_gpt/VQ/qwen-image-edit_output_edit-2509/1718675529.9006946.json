      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns along the shoreline consist of smooth, continuous geometric curves without jagged or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited depiction of waves displays a clear stylistic approach characterized by the use of smooth, geometric curves which contrast the more natural form seen in Image A. These curves are continuous and do not exhibit jagged edges or interruptions. This stylized approach is indicative of artistic design choices that emphasize fluidity and simplification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the palm trees along the right side of the beach represented as clean, straight vertical lines without irregular gaps or misplaced branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are stylized with vertical lines that are clean and consistent, avoiding any irregular gaps or misplaced branches. The artistic rendering in Image B focuses on symmetry and simplification, aligning with stylized art forms which tend to favor more abstract representations that maintain order and clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without visible distortion or mismatched edges between adjacent cloud shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents clouds in an abstract and stylized pattern, emphasizing symmetry and repetition. These clouds form geometric shapes that reduce the complexity present in Image A's more natural and varied cloud forms. The depiction in Image B is intentionally symmetrical, minimizing distortion or unmatched edges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire scene uniformly rendered in muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, with no areas exhibiting bright or out-of-place colors such as vivid cyan or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a palette that predominantly features muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, consistent with artistic design choices that aim for a cohesive and harmonious color scheme. There are no noticeable areas of bright cyan or yellow that would disrupt this uniform aesthetic, aligning with the pattern and color approach of stylized illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the rocks on the sandy shore appear proportionally consistent with the surrounding terrain, and are they positioned in a way that aligns with the slope and texture of the beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation of rocks follows an artistic abstraction and stylization that does not aim to maintain strict proportions or positioning alignment with realism. Thus, while they are part of the scene, their relationship with the beach's slope and texture is more aligned with the artistic style rather than strict proportional consistency.",
