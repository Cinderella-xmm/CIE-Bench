    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cabin’s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the use of brushstrokes, the cabin’s structural elements like the roof, walls, and windows are well-defined and display consistent geometry. This implies precision in the depiction of architectural features, ensuring that each element maintains its straight edges and proper alignment to create a cohesive structure. Therefore, the edges are geometrically consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fir trees demonstrate vertical orientation and the typical layered structure of tree branches even when expressed with loose brushwork. The brushstrokes are used to convey texture and color variance, but the trees retain their characteristic upright form and characteristic foliage layering, indicative of a group of trees. Thus, they remain consistent with natural fir tree structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke from the chimney does rise upward but curves and spreads in a swirling manner rather than straight, suggesting natural movement influenced by wind or air currents rather than a consistent, straight path. This implies a deviation from straight ascent in the depiction of smoke dispersal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow appears evenly distributed across various surfaces, including the roof, ground, and branches. The texture is rendered in a manner that simulates the natural accumulation of snow, with gentle contours and consistent placement, suggesting a plausible winter scene. The depiction aligns with common snowfall patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B around the windows and eaves appears integrated into the scene, using soft brushwork that avoids harsh outlines or excessive glow, contributing to a harmonious look throughout the painting. The illuminations enhance the visual warmth without disrupting the overall stylistic approach maintained through brushwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground elements like the fence and small trees are positioned in a way that visually places them closer to the viewer compared to the cabin and background trees. The arrangement adheres to spatial principles, contributing to a depth perception aligning with natural viewing conditions, where nearer objects appear larger or more detailed.",
