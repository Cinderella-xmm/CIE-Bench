    "Question": "Q1: Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the schematic outline of the wallet is depicted with closed geometric shapes, maintaining accurate proportions. The lines are smooth and exhibit no jagged edges, ensuring the structure is visually coherent and complete. The use of outline sketches typically aims to simplify the depiction while retaining the essential form. As such, the wallet maintains a neat and precise appearance without missing lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?",
    "explanation": "The lines in the schematic diagram of Image B are uniformly thin and continuous, contributing to a clean and professional presentation. There are no observable smudges, texture, or inconsistent thickness that would suggest the presence of artifacts. This level of precision is important in schematic representations to ensure clarity and accuracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text annotations for 'USD,' 'QAR,' and 'INR' are aligned next to their respective banknote illustrations, with a clear distinction between them and the wallet slots. The annotations do not overlap with the banknotes or disrupt the layout of the wallet, ensuring that the visual presentation remains orderly and the information is easily accessible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the exchange rate charts and country economy icons aligned horizontally or vertically in a balanced manner, with no floating or misplaced elements that disrupt visual flow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the exchange rate charts and country economy icons are positioned consistently, aligned in a structured manner. There's no indication of floating or misalignment that would disturb the visual flow. The elements are integrated in a balanced format, allowing for an easily navigable depiction of information related to currency and economy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the visible banknotes (USD $20, QAR 10, INR 50) retain clear denominations, readable text, and intact designs without blurring, stretching, or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while the banknotes illustrated in the infographic are schematic and not exact replicas, the denominations are suggested through placements and accompanying text annotations, which are clear and readable. The illustration does not suffer from issues such as blurring, stretching, or pixelation, which typically affect design coherence. Instead, it focuses on clarity and symbolic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
