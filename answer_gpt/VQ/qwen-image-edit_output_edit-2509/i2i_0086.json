      "question": "Does the golden butterfly appear naturally lit and integrated into the scene without disrupting the existing light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly is positioned above the mirror. The lighting around the mirror creates a warm glow, which is also reflected on the butterfly. This integration makes it appear naturally lit, as the light source, intended to softly illuminate the mirror, also appears to illuminate the butterfly without any noticeable shadows or light source disruption. Given the consistency in lighting, the appearance of the butterfly is well integrated with the ambient light.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the material and texture of the golden butterfly consistent with the surrounding surfaces, avoiding any visible unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly has a metallic gold texture that contrasts with the matte surfaces of the mirror and the surrounding area. Although there is a material difference, the butterfly's texture appears smooth and well-crafted, avoiding any unrealistic or artificial appearance that may suggest a lack of consistency. The intention seems to be decorative rather than an exact match with surrounding textures. It integrates well within real-world expectations of decorative embellishments.",

      "question": "Is the shape of the golden butterfly structurally coherent and free from distortion, maintaining proper geometry as it appears above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly’s shape is structurally sound, with symmetrical wings and realistic detailing. There is no visible distortion or irregularities in its structure when compared to real butterflies or artistic renderings. Its form is proportionate and nests neatly into the mirror’s size without appearing stretched or compressed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the position of the golden butterfly above the mirror contribute positively to the overall composition without creating visual discontinuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is centrally placed above the mirror. This positioning draws the eye naturally as a focal point, complementing the circular mirror and maintaining symmetry in the composition. It adds an artistic element without clashing with the bathroom’s design elements. The butterfly’s placement does not exhibit any visual imbalance or discontinuity, suggesting a well-considered composition.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the golden butterfly been preserved, ensuring clarity and sharpness in comparison to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly exhibits intricate detailing, visible in its wing patterns and body morphology. These details are sharp and clear, consistent with the clarity of other elements in the scene, such as the vase and the sink. There is no evident blur or loss of detail, indicating high-resolution preservation comparable to the rest of the image.",
