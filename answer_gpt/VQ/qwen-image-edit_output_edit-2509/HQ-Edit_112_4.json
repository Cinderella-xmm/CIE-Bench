    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the birdâ€™s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird inside the glass dome appears realistically proportioned, akin to a real bird's anatomy. The feather structure aligns with natural observations of birds, such as the detailed wings and the smooth curvature of the bird's body. The absence of any distortions or exaggerated features suggests careful attention to anatomical accuracy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B shows transparency and smoothness, typical of glass material. The reflections and refractions appear consistent with the curvature of the dome and the lighting, providing a clear view of the contents without distortion or pixelation. The absence of visible seams ensures the realistic portrayal of a glass dome.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden perch displays realistic grain, simulating authentic wood textures. It is positioned directly under the bird, suggesting stable support without visible gaps or misalignment. The combination of texture and positioning implies a realistic perch scenario.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ivy vines in Image B are curved naturally, with leaves spaced appropriately along the dome's structure. There is no visual overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird, suggesting a natural arrangement consistent with leafy plant dynamics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crafted leaves and tree stump in Image B are proportionately smaller compared to the bird, reflecting accurate scale relative to the whole scene. The texture details are visible, displaying authenticity and the elements are neatly positioned on the moss-covered base without misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss-covered base in Image B exhibits a variation in color and texture akin to organic growth. This natural variation in texture avoids sharp edges or uniform areas, preventing an appearance of digital pasting and maintaining realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are consistent with the light source positioned in the upper right. The shadows show soft gradients accompanying the natural fall of light without mismatched highlights, indicating a coherent representation of light interaction in the scene.",
