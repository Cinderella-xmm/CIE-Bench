      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the metallic wing structures exhibit uniform reflective properties and smooth surface transitions without visible seams or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing structures, which appear metallic, show a detailed design with engravings and ornamentation. The lighting and reflections are consistent across the surface, indicating smooth transitions without visible seams or texture repetitions. This suggests that the wings have been carefully integrated and rendered to appear natural and part of a cohesive design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leg-like structures derived from the minarets proportionally consistent with the rest of the structure and do they show natural curvature and joint-like articulation without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leg-like structures resemble minarets but have been stylized to resemble legs. They are well-proportioned in relation to the central structure and demonstrate natural curvature. The articulation points and the curvature look deliberate, avoiding stretching or warping. This suggests a design that ensures coherence and stability in appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central jewel reflect light and cosmic patterns in a way that matches the direction of sunlight and surrounding environment, without appearing to float or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central jewel in Image B visually simulates depth with cosmic patterns and reflects light matching the surrounding celestial setting. The integration of the jewel into the structure and the harmony in lighting ensures it doesn't appear to float disconnectedly, and it casts shadows that are consistent with the overall environmental lighting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing patterns confined to surface-level details, following architectural lines, and do they emit light that blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh glows or obscuring textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing patterns and ornate designs enhance the structure's surface, carefully following architectural lines. The emitted light from these elements integrates smoothly with the ambient environment, blending with the surrounding illumination without creating harsh glares or overwhelming the textures. This attention to detail ensures that the glowing effects enhance rather than obscure the overall design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the junctions between the original building and the transformed elements such as wings, legs, or jewel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the transition areas between the original architectural elements and the transformed features like wings, legs, and jewel reveal clean integration without visible seams, blurring, or color mismatches. This seamless blending suggests highly detailed rendering work ensuring continuity in texture and color.",
