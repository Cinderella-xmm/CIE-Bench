    "Question": "Q1: Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's anatomical features are outlined by monochrome line drawings that aim to trace its actual shape accurately. The lines appear to follow the contours of the butterfly properly, maintaining anatomical structures without overlapping or causing geometric distortions. World knowledge of butterfly structure supports the assessment that these lines are correctly aligned, reflecting the natural anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pink petals appear to be added elements to complement the butterfly's depiction. They maintain consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment with the surrounding natural elements, indicating seamless integration into the flora. World knowledge about floral textures and shadow behavior supports the view that the petals do not display seams or artificial edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text boxes are strategically placed around the butterfly without interfering with the main subject or the floral elements. They are visually balanced across the composition, ensuring readability and maintaining the integrity of the image's aesthetic layout, without obstruction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the vibrant blue color of the butterflyâ€™s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The vibrant blue of the butterfly's wings in Image B is consistent across the entire image. Despite the overlay of anatomical lines, the color maintains its richness without discoloration or loss of detail. World knowledge of color preservation in digital editing confirms this consistency and uniformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
