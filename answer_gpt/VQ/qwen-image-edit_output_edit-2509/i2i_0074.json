      "question": "Do the added text elements such as titles and headings appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or disrupting the surrounding design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text elements such as the title 'IDEAL HOME' are overlaid on the room scene. The integration appears clumsy and disrupts the design because the fonts do not blend with the bedroom image's elegant and subtle aesthetics, introducing a stark contrast. The text overlays of various sizes create a distraction, suggesting that they do not harmonize naturally with the underlying image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and placements of the newly added text elements appropriate, ensuring they do not distort the geometric shapes or disrupt the roomâ€™s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text elements are placed in a manner that overlays significant portions of the bedroom image. The title is large and dominates the top space, while other sections of text at the bottom overlap with the bed and side tables. Their placements interfere with the room's layout, disrupting the visual harmony, and are disproportionate, making them seem imposed rather than naturally integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the style and material used for the text modules match the room's decor, maintaining a cohesive look without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the style of the text, predominantly in bold and non-matching typefaces, clashes with the room's peaceful and minimal aesthetic, which is centered on wood and neutral colors. The text modules do not maintain a cohesive look and instead appear stark and out of place, contrasting the serene decor of the bedroom.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the magazine cover design elements, when placed over the bedroom image, seem visually credible and avoid unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magazine cover elements have been placed over the bedroom image, yet they create an unnatural effect due to their harsh contrast and size. These text elements do not appear credibly integrated into the design of the room, as they overpower rather than complement the existing decor, suggesting a lack of harmonious integration across the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details within the added text elements (titles, headings, and price recommendations) preserved, ensuring their clarity and legibility without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, many of the text elements, especially those beneath the title, lack clarity and legibility, some letters appear distorted, and overall, the text seems low-definition compared to the rest of the image. This results in a degraded appearance, affecting readability and presenting an unpolished aspect of the added elements.",
