    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the figure are designed in an exaggerated style often seen in artistic sculptures, where proportionally elongating the body parts conveys elegance and movement. They are stretched out gracefully without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments, thus maintaining a coherent flow throughout the limbs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boots and leg areas feature a stylized design with distinct geometric patterns. These patterns are applied uniformly with clean edges, as is typical in a well-crafted sculpture, showing no signs of overlapping or fragmentation, maintaining aesthetic accuracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a uniform bronze metallic sheen across all elements of the figure, including skin and boots. Such consistency in the texture and color gradient is typical of metallic sculptures, ensuring there are no patches where mismatched materials appear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
    "explanation": "The pose in Image B conveys a sense of dynamic movement typical of expressive sculptures, with arms extended and balanced body alignment. Despite the artistic exaggeration, the weight distribution still appears natural for the stylized form, without floating limbs or unnatural overlaps.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the extended hand displays exactly five fingers, which follow the expected anatomical spacing and curvature to fit the stylized depiction, without indication of extra digits or fusion between joints.",
    "answer": "Yes"
