    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the piano exhibit a uniform caramel color with visible white and gold icing details that resemble real edible decoration, without unnatural textures or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a piano that, upon closer examination, shows a consistent caramel color across its surface. The details, such as the white and gold icing patterns, are intricate and resemble real edible decoration, typically seen on items like gingerbread cookies. There are no visible digital artifacts or textures that seem unnatural for an object designed to appear as a realistic, edible model. The visual cues align well with a traditional decorative style, ensuring the perception of authenticity in the edible design.",

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the lighting interactions in Image B, the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the direction of the light from the chandelier. These shadows appear soft and naturally diffused, consistent with how light typically behaves when interacting with solid objects and smooth surfaces. The piano's placement and the shadows it casts are congruent with the light source, enhancing realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
