      "question": "Do the swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower maintain consistent geometric continuity without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling cloud-like structures can be seen woven through the tower, seeming to be part of its structure. The edges of these clouds are smooth, and their integration with the architectural elements is coherent, suggesting careful design and manipulation. The absence of sharp, unnatural breaks or jagged edges confirms a seamless incorporation of these elements with the building.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent runes aligned with the wood grain and carving details, and do they emit light without creating unnatural halos or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, runes are overlaid on the wooden parts of the tower, glowing with luminescence. The runes are precisely aligned with the vertical and horizontal grains of wood, indicating thoughtful placement. The emitted glow appears soft and natural without distinct halos or pixelation, ensuring a harmonious visual match with the carving details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shimmering crystal spires reflect light naturally, showing subtle variations in transparency and surface highlights consistent with real crystal under daylight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal spires in Image B are intricately designed, capturing and reflecting daylight similar to real crystals. Variations in transparency and surface highlights are present, indicating a complex interplay of light, a characteristic feature of crystalline structures. This suggests an effective representation of real crystal under natural lighting conditions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing celestial orbs centered and securely attached to the tips of the spires, maintaining proportional scale and alignment with the architectural axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, celestial orbs are positioned around the tips of the spires. These orbs appear to be centered and deliberately placed, aligning with the structural axis of the tower. Their scaling is proportional to the size of the spires, suggesting careful consideration of balance and fit within the architectural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the silver spiral trees maintain three-dimensional volume and proper shadowing, appearing solid rather than transparent or two-dimensional?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver spiral trees in Image B exhibit a dynamic form with shadowing consistent with a three-dimensional volume. The interplay of light and shadow on the spirals gives them depth and solidity, preventing them from appearing flat. This visual treatment suggests well-crafted artistry aimed at ensuring these elements appear substantial and realistic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ghostly bird apparitions semi-transparent with smooth feather outlines and consistent motion direction, without fragmented or duplicated body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ghostly bird apparitions possess a semi-transparent quality, adding to their ethereal appearance. The outlines of their feathers are smooth, and their forms appear coherent and continuous, without signs of distortion or duplication of parts. Their motion direction is consistent across the image, contributing to a uniform and believable portrayal of movement.",
