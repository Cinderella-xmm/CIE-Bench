    "Question": "Q1: Does the man’s head position and hand placement near his ear form a plausible and anatomically correct pose that conveys a contemplative state without distortion or unnatural joint angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's head position and hand placement suggest a typical contemplative gesture. His head is slightly tilted downward, and his hand is near his ear, a common pose for someone lost in thought. The arm and hand are positioned naturally without any evident distortion or awkward angles, allowing for an anatomically realistic and coherent portrayal.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the new background elements (urban structures, lighting, and text) visually consistent with the monochrome tone and do they blend naturally without abrupt edges or conflicting textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of urban structures typical of a noir setting, featuring elements like dark silhouettes of buildings and a lit window. The monochrome tone is consistently applied throughout these elements, ensuring a smooth and natural blend. The text 'Cooka Nor' and thought bubbles are also integrated with the same grayscale, maintaining visual coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the thought bubbles properly aligned with the man’s head, drawn with consistent line quality, and free from pixelation or overlapping distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubbles are positioned near the man’s head, as expected in visual storytelling when depicting thoughts. The line quality appears consistent, with smooth edges and no pixelation or misalignment with the character. This ensures they fit naturally within the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the man’s figure cast a consistent shadow or interact with the billboard surface in a way that preserves spatial depth and avoids floating or disconnected appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's figure is depicted in front of an indoor setting with a table, creating spatial depth through the interaction of light and shadow. While the billboard surface is absent in this version, the setting suggests a cohesive environment where his figure does not seem to float or disconnect from its surroundings.",
