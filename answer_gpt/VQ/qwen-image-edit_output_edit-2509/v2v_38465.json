      "question": "Are the pandas holding the surfboards seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas appear to be standing on the beach while holding surfboards. Their textures seem smooth and well-blended with the scene, with no visible artifacts or sharp edges that suggest unnaturalness. The lighting on the pandas and surfboards matches the sunset setting, helping achieve a seamless integration. This perception is based on the absence of glaring visual inconsistencies and the coherence in lighting and shadows.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards held by the pandas maintain their original shape and proportions without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfboards in Image B appear elongated and symmetric, retaining their streamlined design typical of surfboards. They mimic the dimensions and form seen in Image A, the original picture, indicating consistency and lack of distortion. The comparative analysis confirms that the surfboards maintain their size and shape without deformity.",

      "question": "Do the pandas' postures and positioning appear natural and consistent with the beach and sunset environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are shown standing upright on the beach, each holding a surfboard beside them at a slight angle. This posture is akin to how humans would realistically pose alongside their surfboards at the beach. Their positioning aligns with the visual expectation in a beach setting, where individuals prepare to surf during sunset, suggesting a natural integration given the context.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the sunset and beach setting remained intact and visually credible without any alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the same beach and sunset scene as Image A, evidenced by the unchanged horizon, ocean, and colors typical of a sunset. The ambiance, lighting, and reflections on the water and beach surface have not been altered, retaining the scene's original visual credibility. Comparing both images confirms the consistent portrayal of the sunset and beach environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas' sizes relative to the surfboards and the environment proportionally realistic and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pandas in Image B appear proportionate to the surfboards, holding them in a manner similar to how humans would. Their size relative to the surfboards and the beach environment remains balanced, as pandas are sizable animals, fitting within the frame naturally without appearing too large or small. This is reinforced by comparing it to the human figures in Image A where proportions are consistent.",
