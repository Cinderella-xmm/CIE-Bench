    "Question": "Q1: Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited stylized seating icons are positioned above silhouettes of people sitting. From the visual depiction, these icons appear isolated and do not overlap actual entities depicted in the image, such as individuals. Given the stylized nature of the icons in Image B, shadows or consistent interaction with the sun's illumination are not implied due to the illustrative format.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
    "explanation": "The cool green tones in Image B are uniformly applied as part of the stylistic theme of the infographic, focusing on a simplified, illustrative aesthetic.
