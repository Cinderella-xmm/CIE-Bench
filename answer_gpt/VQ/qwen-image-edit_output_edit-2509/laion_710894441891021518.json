      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the butterfly wings formed from the branches have smooth, continuous outlines without visible breaks, warping, or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings formed from the branches are visually smooth and continuous, showcasing well-crafted outlines without any apparent breaks, warping, or misaligned segments. The wings are artistically integrated into the structure of the branches, illustrating a seamless design. This kind of smoothness indicates an adept design process typically associated with digital artworks or high-quality physical models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent patterns on the butterfly wings evenly distributed with soft edges and no visible digital artifacts like halos or sharp contrast jumps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent patterns on the butterfly wings exhibit a smooth and balanced distribution. The colors blend subtly without sharp transitions or visible artifacts like halos or contrast jumps that might disrupt the pattern's organic appearance. Such even distribution ensures a harmonious aesthetic that is often a sign of meticulous editing or rendering techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing eyes and antlers positioned in a way that respects the original branching structure, with no unnatural overlaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing eyes and antlers are naturally embedded within the branching structure, exhibiting a harmonious alignment with the rest of the figure. The antlers smoothly extend, complementing the aesthetics without any unnatural overlaps or disconnected elements, indicating an integration that respects the organic form of the sculpture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stone base retain natural stone texture, including subtle variations in color and surface depth, without appearing uniformly flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone base shows intricate texture, with subtle variations that mimic natural stone depth and color. These features prevent the base from appearing flat or overly artificial and demonstrate the attention to detail typical of high-quality models or sculptures. This natural texture is crucial for creating a realistic and convincing aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark-like textures on the trunk flow continuously along its contours without sudden breaks, unnatural ridges, or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bark-like textures on the trunk demonstrate a consistent flow along its contours. These textures are naturally scaled, without sudden breaks or ridges that would disrupt the visual harmony of the piece. Such continuous flow is indicative of a well-crafted design, focusing on maintaining realistic organic patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the remaining leaves, soil, and root structures clearly visible and undistorted, with no blurring, loss of edge definition, or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no traditional remaining leaves, soil, or root structures as the design has shifted from a bonsai plant to an elaborate sculpture. The emphasis is on the artistic elements. However, the base and surrounding features, where applicable, retain clarity without distortion or loss of detail, characteristic of high-resolution imagery or professional modeling.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements cast subtle ambient light on nearby surfaces, and do shadows from the wings, eyes, and antlers align with the sceneâ€™s lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing elements like the eyes and luminescent patterns on the wings appear to cast a soft ambient light that interacts subtly with nearby surfaces. Shadows from the wings, eyes, and antlers are coherent with the overall lighting direction, suggesting a deliberate and controlled editing process to ensure realistic lighting effects in the scene.",
