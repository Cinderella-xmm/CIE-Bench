      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is adorned with curvilinear patterns that are characteristic of Art Nouveau style.

This demonstrates a successful integration of the background with the main elements, avoiding any visual disruption.",

The button stands out sufficiently for functionality while maintaining the delicacy often associated with this style, showing effective design integration.",
