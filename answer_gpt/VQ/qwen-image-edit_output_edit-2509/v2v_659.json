      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a 3D chibi-style mascot wearing a crown and holding a bowl of cereal. Generally, the transition from a real-life figure to a chibi style can introduce slight exaggerations or modifications typical of pop culture representations, such as enlarged heads and simplified body shapes. These changes are expected, not usually considered distortions. The presence of a crown and other elements suggest a stylistic adaptation without blatant distortion of structural features.",
