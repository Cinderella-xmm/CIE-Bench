      "question": "Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the facial area has been blurred and pixelated intentionally, so it does not retain a natural skin texture or coloration. This editing choice introduces artificial features like pixelation indicative of unnatural editing. Thus, the facial skin does not retain a smooth, consistent texture due to these modifications.",

      "question": "Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents an angel adorned in elaborate garments. Visual inspection shows that the materials exhibit appropriate draping and fold depth, with the clothing fitting naturally with the body contours. There are no floating or disconnected elements, suggesting successful integration of the garments.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the wings appear as subtle, layered highlights that follow the natural curvature of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or breaking feather edges?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the wings with gold accents that mimic subtle highlights. These follow the natural feather curvature without glaring highlights or disrupting feather edges. They blend well within the image's lighting scheme, illustrating careful highlighting.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial background integrates smoothly with the angel figure. The lighting direction matches across the image, with transitions between the figure and the background being seamless, showing consistency without abrupt edges or depth mismatches.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B exhibit natural joint alignment with five fingers clearly visible on each hand. The hands show appropriate skin texture and shadowing consistent with realistic contours. There are no signs of extra digits or swelling.",
