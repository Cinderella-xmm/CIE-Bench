    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wingâ€™s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the sheet music is overlaid on the orange sections of the butterfly's wings. Upon examination, the musical notes are placed within the natural sections created by the wing's vein lines, suggesting that the patterns are integrated thoughtfully. The continuity and placement align with the natural structure, preserving the texture and appearance of a real butterfly wing, and no obvious artifacts or disruptions are visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's antennae extend smoothly from the head, displaying a natural curve without any breaks, kinks, or discrepancies in length. This suggests a harmonious and realistic depiction in line with how actual butterfly antennae appear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "These flowers surround the butterfly and their petals contain elements resembling musical notes, highlighting a design merging motifs and natural forms. However, despite this creative choice, the overall shape, curvature, and thickness of the petals are consistent with what one would expect from real flowers, maintaining realistic traits while being imaginatively modified.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the elements, including the butterfly and surrounding flowers, are arranged in a harmonious circular layout, creating a balanced composition. The distance and angles seem deliberately set for symmetry, enhancing the visual appeal without making any element seem out of place or disproportionate.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text rendered with smooth, continuous strokes and no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text 'Monarch's Garden Symphony' is displayed at the top of the image in a stylish font. Upon inspection, the strokes of the text appear smooth and continuous, without any notable aliasing or jagged edges. The rendering quality matches the high standard seen throughout the image, supporting clarity and a professional finish.",
