      "question": "Does the character's 3D chibi appearance maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is designed in a chibi style, which typically means exaggerated, cute proportions such as a larger head and shorter limbs. Based on this style, the character maintains a cohesive and credible appearance without unnatural distortions. This is consistent with the chibi style, which often includes specific proportions for aesthetic purposes.",
