      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot figures in Image B have humanoid forms with proportioned limbs and heads that do not resemble the cylindrical form of batteries. The design is sleek and futuristic, suggesting inspiration from advanced robotic aesthetics rather than maintaining the cylindrical shape of batteries. Therefore, from a design standpoint, the figures are proportionate and structurally coherent for humanoid robots, without reference to any battery form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the robot figures made from the batteries rendered with a consistent metallic texture that mimics copper and black materials without visible artifacts like checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the robot figures in Image B exhibit a smooth, metallic texture reminiscent of advanced machines and robots, rather than directly mimicking copper or black materials specifically tied to batteries. There are no visible artifacts such as checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections present in the rendering, suggesting a high-quality texture consistent throughout the figures.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cityscape in Image B is depicted with a gradient sky that complements the futuristic vibe and is layered behind the robots correctly. The light source in the background appears aligned with the illumination on the robots, creating a coherent scene where lighting and atmospheric conditions are in harmony.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital screen in Image B shows text that is clear and legible, with smooth edges and a design that integrates with the overall sci-fi theme of the illustration. The ambient lighting matches the rest of the scene, and there are no signs of pixelation or distortion, indicating a seamless integration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the robot figures, title, and digital screen is done thoughtfully, with each component occupying its own space without overlap. This ensures that all elements remain legible and distinct, maintaining a clear and organized layout.",
