    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the body shapes of both elephants smoothly transformed into curved bottle forms without visible breaks or unnatural bends in their silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects appear to be bottle-shaped, reflecting a smooth transformation with no irregularities or awkward bends. The curvature is consistent with typical bottle designs, suggesting a natural and seamless transition from the elephant forms in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant ears appear as gold-trimmed bottle caps with smooth edges and no misalignment or deformation compared to the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The objects in Image B have features mimicking elephant ears, styled as bottle caps. These are gold-trimmed and visually consistent with their surroundings, showing no signs of misalignment or deformation relative to the structure, maintaining coherence and symmetry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants replaced with a clear, evenly distributed glass mosaic pattern that reflects light naturally without artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a glass mosaic pattern on the object surfaces. This pattern is evenly distributed and reflects light in a way that appears natural, lacking any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies in how the reflection should occur in real-world conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brand logo and fragrance name label clearly visible along the trunks without stretching, warping, or overlapping with other features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design incorporates clear branding elements placed prominently on the frontal area. These are not located on trunk-like regions but are clearly visible without warping or unintended overlap with other design features, ensuring legibility and aesthetic consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the gold trim, glass mosaic patterns, and bottle surfaces exhibit consistent lighting and reflection behavior that aligns with real-world material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold trim and mosaic patterns in Image B show consistent lighting and reflection behavior appropriate to their materials. The lighting matches typical reflections expected on such surfaces in reality, indicating attention to detail in portraying real-world material properties effectively.",
