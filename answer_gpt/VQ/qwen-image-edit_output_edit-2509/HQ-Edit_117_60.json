      "question": "Are the sails rendered as smooth, polished walnut with visible and consistent grain patterns that mimic real wood, without artificial sheen or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails display a clear, consistent grain pattern typical of wood, suggesting they are rendered as polished walnut. The grain appears natural and uniform, like genuine wood material, without signs of artificial sheen or repeated texture. This gives credibility to the conclusion that the sails mimic real wood effectively without unnatural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hull display deep, textured carvings that resemble individual walnut planks with natural variations in thickness and spacing, preserving the original boat’s silhouette without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull in Image B is intricately carved, revealing texture akin to working with walnut wood. The carvings suggest the semblance of planks with subtle variations, without compromising the shape or outline of the boat from Image A. The silhouette remains intact, appearing undistorted, which supports the conclusion about texture detail and natural plank representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the boat positioned on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that is properly grounded and aligned with the boat’s base, without appearing to float or disconnect from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boat in Image B is shown atop a pale beige pedestal that visually connects with the base, ensuring grounding integrity. The pedestal does not create an impression of the boat floating or being misaligned from the surface, indicating proper positioning and alignment.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wood tones across the sails and hull show natural variation in color and reflectivity under the ambient light, without uniformity or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the wood tones across the sails and hull appear to vary naturally, as expected with organic walnut wood, under the ambient light conditions. The wood shows changes in color and reflectivity naturally, free from uniformity or exaggerated highlights, consistent with realistic wood behavior.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all structural elements such as the mast, rigging, and deck preserved in correct alignment and proportion relative to each other, without stretching, bending, or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the boat's structural elements such as the mast, rigging, and deck, all in correct alignment and proportion, closely resembling those in Image A. There is no visual distortion, stretching, or absence of parts, ensuring that the boat's integrity and realistic depiction are maintained.",
