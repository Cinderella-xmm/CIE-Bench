    "Question": "Q1: Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "The raised leg and upper arm in Image B are depicted with smooth, continuous lines, indicative of an artistic style that prioritizes fluidity and grace. This is consistent with the approach often taken in illustrations to convey elegance in movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the colors of the figure's clothing and the surrounding environment (sky, sand, water) unified in tone, with no abrupt shifts or clashing hues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tones are soft and harmoniously blended, with the figure’s clothing and the environment depicted in complementary shades of green and blue. The colors transition smoothly in this artistic representation, enhancing visual coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?",
    "explanation": "The depiction in Image B shows an exaggerated but balanced pose, common in illustrative art, where the neck and torso align in a way that suggests flexibility. The arms are drawn with graceful arcs, avoiding abrupt angles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?",
    "explanation": "The textures in Image B are smoothly rendered, with shading that complements the overall illustration style. There is a lack of pixelation or smearing, as the art is likely digitally created with a clean finish.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hand appears stylized, adhering to an artistic style that captures the essence rather than anatomical precision. However, the fingers seem well-positioned and avoid visual errors, with all five digits visible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the shadow beneath the figure aligned with the sun’s position in the sky and does it taper naturally toward the horizon?",
    "explanation": "The shadow in Image B is artistically crafted to reflect the sunlight, cast directly beneath the figure, and tapers off naturally, consistent with how shadows behave under direct light conditions like a setting sun.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible halos, jagged edges, or blending errors along the outline of the figure, particularly around the raised leg and arm?",
    "explanation": "The outline in Image B is smooth, typical for digital illustrations, which usually avoid issues like halos or jagged edges through precise rendering techniques. The transitions between colors are seamlessly executed.",
    "answer": "No"
