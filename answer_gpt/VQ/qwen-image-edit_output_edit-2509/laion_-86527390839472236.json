    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a tall, rectangular silhouette with smooth, continuous vertical sides and no visible warping or collapsed edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, using visual examination, the transformed object appears with a tall, rectangular silhouette similar to a traditional perfume bottle. Its sides are smooth and continuous without visible warping or collapsed edges, showing a consistent geometry and structure that effectively replicates typical characteristics of such bottles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the retractable handle replaced by a metallic spray nozzle that appears seamlessly attached to the top of the vessel, with no visible seams or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the top of the bottle where typically a nozzle would be found on a perfume bottle. While the retractable handle is removed and replaced by an object resembling a traditional perfume bottle cap, there is no visible spray nozzle present. The cap provides a look of continuity with the top of the bottle, but it does not suggest a functional nozzle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fabric panels replaced with translucent purple-tinted glass that shows uniform translucency and clearly defined embossed linear patterns matching the original seam locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the object is transformed into a glass vessel with a purple tint, and the translucency is uniform across its surface. However, there are no embossed linear patterns on the translucent glass visible in the original picture. The transformation encompasses a uniform smooth glass surface instead.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the logo positioned near the top center of the front face and rendered as a clean, subtle etching on the glass surface without any visible digital artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the logo is indeed positioned at the top center of the bottle's front face. It appears as a clean design etched directly into the glass, with no visible artifacts or blurring, suggesting careful rendition and integration into the glass surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the four wheels replaced with identical decorative caps at each corner of the base, appearing as solid, polished elements without exposed mechanical parts or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features wheels that resemble those in Image A, maintaining their mechanical appearance and location at each corner. They are not replaced by decorative caps but rather kept as the suitcase-like element in the perfume bottle design with visible mechanical concept preserved.",
