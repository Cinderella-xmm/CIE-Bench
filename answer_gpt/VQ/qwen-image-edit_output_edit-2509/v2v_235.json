    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer in the chibi style maintains expected proportions where the limbs, torso, and head have a consistent relationship similar to human anatomy. The analysis involved evaluating the symmetry and positioning of the limbs and body, which retain expected human proportions without visible distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing elliptical portal visually credible, with no obvious artifacts where it meets the realistic dance studio environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing elliptical portal fits seamlessly into the dance studio background without visible artifacts or mismatches in lighting, suggesting a convincing integration of portal elements within the scene. The soft glow and gradient lighting reflect on the surrounding surfaces naturally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dancer's hand extending towards the viewer retain natural textures and details, with no more than five fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's hand visible in the foreground shows a smooth surface consistent with the stylized 3D chibi design. It presents no additional fingers or unnatural features, maintaining expected anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world consistent with the dancer's pose, contributing to a natural and visually plausible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting surrounding the dancer's portal is vibrant and enhances the dancer's pose, contributing to a unified perception of the scene. The spotlights relate proportionally to the pose, creating realistic casts and reflections expected in such an environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal positioned in a balanced manner that enhances visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is analyzed for its spatial arrangement, which follows a 2:3 aspect ratio. The portal forms an oval center piece, balancing the dancer's pose, ensuring that elements occupy spaces naturally to maintain visual credibility and symmetry.",
