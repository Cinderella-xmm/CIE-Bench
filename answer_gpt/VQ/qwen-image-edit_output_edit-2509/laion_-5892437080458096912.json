      "question": "Does the gold necklace at the neck area have smooth, continuous lines without jagged edges or pixelation, and does it integrate seamlessly with the surrounding skin and garment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold necklace can be evaluated by looking at its outlines, which appear smooth and continuous, suggesting the absence of jagged edges or pixelation. Additionally, it is important to assess how the necklace visually integrates with the skin and garment: it appears to sit naturally and smoothly against the body, without any evident disruption or mismatch, indicating seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the golden satin material on the gown uniformly textured with consistent light reflection, and do the geometric embroidery patterns follow logical symmetry and spacing without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden satin material on the gown in Image B appears uniformly textured, as evidenced by the consistent reflections of light across the fabric, indicating consistency in texture and material. Furthermore, the geometric embroidery is symmetrical and evenly spaced, maintaining logical patterns that are not distorted, indicating a high-quality representation of textile artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the exposed shoulders anatomically accurate with natural skin tone and texture, and are the Greek motifs clearly defined and properly aligned with the shoulder structure without overlapping or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the exposed shoulders in Image B reveals that they are depicted with natural skin tones and consistent texture, reflecting an understanding of human anatomy. The Greek motifs adorning the garment are also carefully defined and appear to be aligned with the contours of the shoulders, following the body's structure without distortion, overlapping, or warping. This reflects a well-executed alignment with the figure.",

      "question": "Does the background scene feature coherent lighting, realistic proportions of olive trees and columns, and a seamless integration with the figure’s silhouette without visible edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background scene includes olive trees and columns that exhibit realistic proportions, matching natural expectations for such elements. The scene's lighting is coherent, evidenced by consistent shadows and illumination throughout. The seamless integration with the figure’s silhouette, without visible edges or signs of misalignment, illustrates a cohesive composition between the background and the foreground figure.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand near the waist have five distinct fingers with natural joint angles, smooth skin texture, and proper shadowing consistent with the light source, without any added or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand near the waist in Image B possesses five distinct fingers, which are arranged with natural joint angles reflecting typical human anatomy. The skin texture is smooth, and shading on the hand corresponds appropriately to the apparent light source in the image, accentuating the three-dimensionality and natural shadowing expected. There are no added or missing digits, confirming anatomical accuracy.",
