      "question": "Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vases have a marbled ceramic finish with patterns that appear fluid and natural. The marbling displays a smooth transition across the surface, which is characteristic of a quality marble finish without texture breaks or odd repetitions that would imply artificial manipulation. These observations use world knowledge of how authentic marbling typically appears—random yet aesthetically balanced.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the branding decals on the vases are visible and appear to be proportionately scaled, which means they fit well within the space they're applied to. They are aligned with the surface curvature without signs of distortion or warping. To deduce this, I consider how decals typically adhere to surfaces—smoothly following the curvature when expertly applied.",

      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the gold leaf accents on the vases display realistic highlights and distinct edge definitions. With knowledge of metallic foils, I understand that such materials often catch light uniquely, creating highlights that should match the curvatures and contours of the vase. The highlights and definitions in Image B support the idea that these accents are realistically applied.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the cross-sectional illustration depicted on the packaging box accurately mirrors the internal petal arrangement observed in the actual vases. There are no evident mismatches in geometry or layering defects, indicating a faithful representation. I use the logic of consistency between an illustration and its physical counterpart to make this assessment.",

      "question": "Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze typography on the packaging box seen in Image B is clear, with letters that are evenly spaced and free from any blurring or shadows that could reduce legibility. This observation aligns with the expected clarity and precision that should be present in quality printed typography, especially for a premium product's packaging.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vases in Image B appear symmetrical and maintain their original proportions. For comparison, Image A shows similarly shaped vases, so no unusual stretching or compressing is visible in the edited image. Comparing the symmetry and proportions with the original using structural consistency leads to this conclusion.",
