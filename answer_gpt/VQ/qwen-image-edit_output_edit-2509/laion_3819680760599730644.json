      "question": "Is the lens area transformed into eyes with smooth, symmetrical shapes and natural-looking reflections, without jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens area has been creatively transformed into eyes. The eyes have smooth, symmetrical shapes, which are essential for cartoon characteristics. The reflections are designed to look natural and add life to the character, maintaining a smooth transition without any jagged edges or lighting inconsistencies. This transformation is consistent with the creative intention of anthropomorphizing the camera in a 'chibi' style.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons on the top of the camera have been artistically reshaped into brows.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explorer's hat is placed on top of the camera, aligned in a way that suggests it's worn by the camera character. The lighting is consistent across the hat and the rest of the image, indicative of a coherent light source. There are no visible gaps or unnatural overlaps with the camera body, demonstrating a professional blending and positioning.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower part of Image B shows a part of a backpack attached to the camera 'character.' The shadows and placement give the impression of a realistic attachment, which aligns with the cartoon nature of the image.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
