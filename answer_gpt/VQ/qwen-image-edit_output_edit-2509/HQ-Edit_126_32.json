      "question": "Do the luminescent ferns in the canopy have consistent, organic shapes and smooth gradients that resemble real plant growth patterns without pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the canopy is adorned with luminescent ferns that appear to have smooth, organic shapes. The gradients within each fern look continuous, resembling realistic plant growth patterns. There are no visible pixelation issues or jagged edges, indicating a smooth editing process. The consistent luminous quality further enhances the natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver tribal patterns on the bark aligned with the natural contours of the trunk and free from floating, misaligned, or unnaturally sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunk is adorned with silver tribal patterns. These patterns follow the natural contours of the trunk, seamlessly integrating with its shape, and do not appear to be floating or misaligned. The edges of the patterns are smooth, consistent with the organic design, and do not exhibit any sharp or unnatural edges.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the translucent wings extending from the canopy smoothly connected to the treeâ€™s branches, showing gradual transparency and consistent layering without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, translucent wings are visually extending from the canopy. They are smoothly connected to the branches without any abrupt visual disconnects or seams becoming apparent. The transparency of the wings appears gradual, maintaining consistent layering, and there is no evidence of geometric distortions that break the visual cohesion of the wings with the rest of the tree.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glass-like fibers forming the trunk exhibit realistic light refraction, consistent thickness variation, and continuous flow without abrupt breaks or unnatural twists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a tree trunk composed of glass-like fibers. These fibers display realistic light refraction, drawing on how light typically interacts with glass surfaces. The variation in thickness appears intentional and smooth, enhancing the organic feel of the design. There are no visible abrupt breaks or unnatural twists, maintaining a consistent flow throughout the trunk structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils extend from the tree base into the ground with smooth curvature and consistent luminosity, without intersecting the grass unnaturally or showing flat, non-continuous surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing tendrils emanate from the base of the tree, extending smoothly into the ground. They exhibit a consistent luminosity, shining uniformly without any jagged fluctuation in brightness. The tendrils curve naturally and elegantly, without intersecting the grass unnaturally or presenting any flat or discontinuous surfaces.",
