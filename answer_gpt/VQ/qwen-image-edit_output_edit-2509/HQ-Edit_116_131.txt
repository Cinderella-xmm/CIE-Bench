    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral patterns on the qipao clearly defined with consistent outlines and no broken or distorted petals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the qipao are well-rendered with a stylized approach typical of animation or graphic art. The outlines are clear and consistent without any visible distortions or breaks, reflecting a neat and complete design. The stylized nature supports the idea that the patterns are intentionally and coherently created, maintaining the integrity of each floral element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the jade-patterned clasps align correctly along the central seam and display consistent shape and size without deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jade-patterned clasps are graphic elements that are symmetrically aligned along the central seam of the qipao design. They appear proportionate and consistently shaped, indicative of a digitally replicated pattern typical in illustrations. This aligns with the expected uniformity and precision in graphic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the color distribution across the qipao uniform, with no visible banding or abrupt transitions between hues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color distribution is depicted with smooth and harmonious transitions between colors. This is achieved using digital gradients which ensure that any blending of colors appears seamless and without abrupt changes, typical of vector graphics where uniformity in color application is deliberate.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the detachable writing sections placed with clean edges and consistent lighting, and do they appear anchored to the garment rather than floating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the detachable writing sections have cleanly defined edges that blend indirectly with the design of the qipao. The sections appear integrated into the composition, suggesting a deliberate anchoring effect using shadows and alignment, avoiding the 'floating' appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand show five fingers with normal spacing, natural curvature, and no extra or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents an illustrative style, focusing mainly on the qipao and its design rather than a detailed representation of human anatomy. The hand does not feature prominently and is not included in Image B; hence, this aspect doesn't apply.",
    "answer": "No"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all elements of the qipao and added components proportionally balanced and spatially coherent without stretching or compression?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish style of representation retains symmetry and proportional balance throughout the qipao's design and additional components. Illustrative styles ensure that elements maintain their designed proportions, preventing any apparent stretching or compression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
