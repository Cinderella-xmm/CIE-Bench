    "Question": "Q4: Are the pastel colors applied uniformly across the forest floor and foliage without creating unnatural color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of fine details like moss texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel colors are applied evenly across the forest floor and surrounding foliage. Given the cartoon style, there are no instances of color bleeding that would appear unnatural for this type of illustration. There is no pixelation visible, and although the style does not include detailed textures like moss (as it is more stylized), it retains an appropriate consistency within the intended design.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the speech bubble positioned at a plausible distance from the fox, with correct shadowing and edge blending that matches the lighting and depth of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is positioned above the fox, maintaining a standard distance one might expect in this type of cartoon illustration. Since the image is stylized and does not closely follow real-world lighting and depth, shadowing and edge blending are not explicitly detailed. However, the placement and design of the speech bubble are consistent with typical cartoon conventions.",
