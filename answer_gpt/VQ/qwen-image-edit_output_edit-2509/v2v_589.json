        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls have a bright lime-green color similar to the soccer cleat and tennis ball in the first image. This indicates a consistent color theme, and there are no apparent artifacts that would deviate from this consistency. The visual information suggests that the nesting dolls successfully carry the same vibrant color and texture without any disturbances.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
