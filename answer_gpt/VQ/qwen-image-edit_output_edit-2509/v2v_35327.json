      "question": "Does the gold banana appear naturally integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold banana is stylized and set against a surreal backdrop. The banana's sheen and texture are consistent with a metallic or gold-painted appearance common in artistic renderings. Without directly comparing to Image A, the banana in Image B integrates aesthetically with the surrounding surreal elements, suggesting intentional artistic stylization rather than accidental artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the liquefying textures applied to the blue figure natural, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue figure exhibits a fluid-like texture that is consistent with a surreal art style. The textures add an organic flow without appearing chaotic or disruptive. There's no evident loss of detail such as in the fingers or shoulders, indicating the transformation maintains a deliberate style while preserving overall form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the fantastical background maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, without any broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B presents swirls and flowy elements that align with its surreal style. These elements appear consistently integrated with no abrupt discontinuities or broken geometric shapes. The textures and colors complement the gold banana and blue figure, providing a cohesive visual narrative.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of elements in the surrealist-style painting maintain visual credibility and avoid any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, as a surrealist artwork, plays with exaggerated and fluid shapes but stays visually coherent within its artistic realm. The arrangement of the banana, hand, and background flows without appearing distorted or mismatched against each other, preserving artistic integrity.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the banana retain its natural appearance, with the correct number of fingers, natural lines, and textures conforming to ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand retains a natural appearance despite the artistic styling. The hand maintains the correct number of fingers and a believable grip on the banana, with textural details consistent with the transformation done on the figure. The design respects ergonomic principles as observed in typical human hand movements.",
