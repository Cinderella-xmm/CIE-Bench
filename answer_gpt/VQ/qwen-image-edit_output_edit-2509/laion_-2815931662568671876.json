      "question": "Does the monocle added to the tortilla chip maintain a consistent size and shape relative to the chip, and is it seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocle is placed over one of the tortilla chip's eyes, which implies that it should logically be a fitting size for that feature. It visually aligns with the chip and does not appear disproportionate in size. The integration looks natural, with no visible shading errors or artifacts that would indicate poor editing. The drawing style also matches the illustrative look of the comic, making the monocle part appear as if it belongs within the same animated world.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound proportionally sized and shaped like a realistic hand, with no more than five fingers and natural joint lines, and does it appear to emerge naturally from the guacamole without breaking its texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the appendage that appears like a hand coming from the guacamole is illustrated in a stylized form, typical of animated cartoons. The hand is drawn with three fingers, which is often seen in cartoon depictions to simplify anatomy while maintaining recognizability. While it is not proportioned like a realistic human hand due to the three fingers, it still fits within the context of a cartoon. The guacamole around the hand does not show disruptions in texture consistent with the cartoon style. Thus, the hand emerges as naturally as expected within the illustrated world.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spice rack positioned behind the tortilla chip in a way that respects perspective and shadow direction, and does it blend naturally with the existing background without visible seams or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spice rack is part of the illustration behind the character wearing the monocle. When considering cartoon perspective, perfect alignment isn’t necessary as the artistic style allows for exaggerated views and playful distortions. Therefore, the spice rack in Image B appears consistent with the illustratively stylized interior environment. There are no visible seams or color mismatches that would signal it being artificially inserted separately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mini flag banners aligned horizontally and evenly spaced above the table, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the light source, without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag banners over the table are part of the cartoon setting. They follow a horizontal orientation that matches the visual angle of the scene. The spacing between flags seems regular and fits the stylized criteria for a cartoon party scene. There are no overt signs of being digitally pasted as they blend well with the illustrative background, though subtle shadows or 3D effects aren’t necessary in this artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole been adjusted to pastel shades without losing their inherent textures or becoming unnaturally pale or washed out, maintaining visual credibility as edible items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tortilla chip and guacamole exhibit bright, colorful shades typical of cartoon illustrations. Their textures are simplified but recognizable: tortilla chips are depicted as crispy surfaces, and guacamole retains a simply textured look. The colors are vibrant—which aligns with the energetic and whimsical atmosphere often designed for fun and engaging comic panels. The colors are bright, capturing the essence of edible items in the context of this visual style, though not exactly pastel.",
