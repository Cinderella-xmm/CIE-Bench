      "question": "Do the added decorative green leaf graphics around the fruit platter appear natural without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green leaf graphics are placed around the fruit platter as part of the design elements for the packaging. The leaves have smooth edges, consistent color, and a texture that matches typical graphic design standards. This suggests they are intentionally stylized for visual appeal and fit seamlessly with the overall design. There is no indication of any artifacts or awkward textures that would make them appear unnatural.",

      "question": "Are the shapes and arrangements of the fruits in the platter consistent and unaltered, avoiding any distortions or unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the arrangement of the fruits—such as kiwi, orange slices, blueberries, and watermelon—is symmetrical and neatly organized, consistent with a typical presentation in food packaging. There are no visible signs of stretching, warping, or distortion of the fruit shapes, indicating they appear natural and unaltered.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition between the light green gradient background and the fruit platter look natural without any abrupt edges or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B transitions smoothly from a light green gradient to the fruit platter. There are no visible lines or abrupt edges dividing the two elements; instead, the gradient provides a soft backdrop that complements the platter, suggesting a natural transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures and details of the sliced kiwi, banana, and other fruits are clear and well-defined, with colors accurately representing what one would expect these fruits to look like. The detailing is consistent, without any signs of pixelation or degradation, preserving their natural appearance.",

      "question": "Do the added green leaf graphics contribute to the visual credibility of the packaging design without disrupting the overall balance and harmony of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green leaf graphics added to Image B surround the fruit platter in a way that enhances the packaging design by emphasizing the natural and healthy theme. They do not overwhelm or clash with the central image of the fruit platter but instead provide a cohesive frame, maintaining visual balance and harmony.",
