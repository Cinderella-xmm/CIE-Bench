        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine, although chibi-style, appears to maintain the general proportions and posture of a human figure climbing a ladder. The limbs and body are in a natural pose, reflective of climbing, without any visible distortions or unusual deformations that would detract from its representation. This suggests careful attention to maintaining a realistic posture even in a stylized format.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "explanation": "In Image B, the ladder and window are rendered within the constraints of the diorama's space. They appear properly proportioned relative to the figurine and the surrounding context.
