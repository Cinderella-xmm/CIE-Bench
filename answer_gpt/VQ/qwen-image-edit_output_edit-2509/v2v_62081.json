      "question": "Are the black ink strokes used for the gentleman's hair natural and free from unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black ink strokes used for the gentleman's hair appear deliberately stylized in an expressive manner typical of ink drawings. The strokes are bold and clear, showing intentional artistic choice without visible artifacts or unnatural textures. The variation in ink density contributes to a natural flow characteristic of brushwork.",

      "question": "Do the facial features and cravat depicted with grey washes maintain structural consistency and appear visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grey washes used for the facial features and cravat demonstrate a sense of depth and dimension that aligns with traditional painting techniques. The anatomy appears to be consistently represented with the stylized choice typical of art rather than photorealism, maintaining visual credibility.",

      "question": "Does the antique white paper ground have a subtle texture that enhances the natural appearance without causing any visual distractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paper ground in Image B has a subtle texture that is typical of high-quality art paper. This texture is soft and consistent, which enhances the overall aesthetic of the image without being overly prominent or causing distractions. The antique white color provides a neutral backdrop that complements the ink and washes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the darker ink outlines representing the wooden frame coherent and do they avoid breaking the geometric shapes of the original frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ink outlines act as a decorative border rather than a direct representation of a wooden frame. The brushwork is loose and expressive, intentionally deviating from a linear geometric presentation to create a more dynamic visual effect. While this breaks the geometric form seen in traditional frames, it maintains coherence within the artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the ink strokes of the hair, the grey washes of the facial features, and the background smooth and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transitions in Image B are smooth, with ink strokes and grey washes merging naturally into the background without obvious discontinuities or artifacts. This results in a harmonious composition where different elements blend seamlessly, indicative of skilled technique in ink wash painting.",
