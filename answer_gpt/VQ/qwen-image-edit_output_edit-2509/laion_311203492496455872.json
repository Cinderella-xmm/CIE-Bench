      "question": "Does the transformed hairstyle retain a consistent volumetric structure without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the cotton candy swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle is designed to mimic the look of cotton candy, with soft, rounded swirls. The structure appears to maintain a consistent volume, and there are no visible jagged edges or breaks in the swirls, which indicates a smooth and cohesive design. Combining this observation with the understanding of how cotton candy typically appears suggests that the effect is deliberate and well-executed.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the suit with a glossy surface. The colors are vibrant and bright, giving the suit a bold appearance.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an oversized tie that is visually striking, but it aligns well with the collar and neck area.
