    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's limbs and torso appear well-proportioned with appropriate joint articulation, reflecting a typical human posture even within a stylized context. The suit follows natural body lines, and there is no noticeable distortion in limb size or positioning that would suggest unnatural articulation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the tuxedo and fur jacket with textures that have enough fidelity to suggest depth and material qualities. The tuxedo has a subtle sheen typical of formal fabric, and the fur jacket displays variability in texture that implies physical believability.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the FIA logo and sponsor names are visible and legible, maintaining proper formation with clear text and logos. They are positioned against a uniform background which enhances their clarity despite the stylized setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold ribbon-like border in Image B is complete, maintains an even shape, and appears consistent in thickness around the stamp's perimeter, suggesting a well-defined and symmetrical design element indicative of quality framing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed logo on the blue envelope in Image B appears with consistent depth and subtle shadowing, enhancing the 3D aspect of the embossing. The texture maintains a realistic appearance that suggests genuine embossing instead of a flat or poorly rendered effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stamp's shadowing and perspective are handled in such a way that it aligns with the envelope surface, creating the illusion of physical attachment. The perspective is consistent with a realistic setting, reinforcing this visual attachment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals appear to have five fingers on each hand. The hand shapes are natural, showing no signs of deformation or missing digits, indicating typical anatomical depiction consistent with human physiology.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
