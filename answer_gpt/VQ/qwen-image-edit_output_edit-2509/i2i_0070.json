      "question": "Does the African savanna at night blend seamlessly with the existing train and tracks, without any unnatural edges or contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is set against a backdrop of an African savanna at night. The blending of these elements focuses on how naturally the landscape transitions behind and around the train and tracks. Observing the edges where the train and tracks meet the savanna, there should be no glaring differences in lighting or texture that would suggest a layering effect. The editing appears seamless as there are no visible unnatural borders or inconsistencies between the train, tracks, and savanna.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stars and the Milky Way depicted naturally, without any artificial or pixelated textures disrupting their appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the stars and the Milky Way requires careful observation of the clarity, consistency, and naturalness of these celestial elements. The sky should appear smooth, devoid of pixelation or disruptive textures that would suggest digital manipulation. The stars and Milky Way in Image B indeed appear smooth and natural, with a realistic distribution that does not distract or create an impression of artificial enhancement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks correspond logically to the new nighttime savanna setting, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing Image B requires understanding how the lighting would realistically interact with the environment in a nighttime savanna setting. The train and tracks should be subtly lit or shadowed to reflect the limited light available at night. The coherence of shadows and highlights should match the starry backdrop, and Image B seems to maintain this by not having any improper lighting or mismatched shadow positions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the train relative to the vastness of the African savanna and the starry sky proportionally correct and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In evaluating Image B, the train's size compared to the expanse of the African savanna and vast sky must seem logical. The scale should make sense so that the train does not appear too small or excessively large against the backdrop. In this case, the train retains a believable size, suggesting it fits naturally within the landscape, without dominating the scene or appearing oddly diminutive.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the train been preserved without degradation or introduction of unnatural textures during the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B needs a thorough inspection of the train's features, such as surface details, textures, and outlines, to determine if any detail was lost or altered during editing. The image retains the intricate features of the train without exhibiting blurriness or added textures that seem misplaced due to digital editing. The detailed clarity of the train is indeed preserved.",
