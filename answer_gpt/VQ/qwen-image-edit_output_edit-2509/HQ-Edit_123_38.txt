    "Question": "Q1: Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke effect is used as part of the artistic representation of the gymnast. The blue brushstroke effect is applied in the background and complements the figure. Despite the brushstrokes around the figure, they do not interfere with or obscure the outlines of the limbs, head, or torso, which maintain clear and defined edges. This artistic choice ensures the main figure is distinct and intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are painted in an artistic style which emphasizes shape and color rather than anatomical precision. While the hands are stylized, they clearly have five fingers each. The joint alignment is exaggerated, typical of stylized art, and does not reflect the realistic joint positions or skin texture. The emphasis is more on aesthetic flow rather than anatomical accuracy.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the elongated legs form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet without abrupt bends or discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are depicted with smooth, continuous lines, forming a graceful curve from the hips to the feet. The focus on fluid movement is typical in stylized art, and there are no abrupt bends or breaks in the contour of the legs, enhancing the elegance of the pose.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the blue and silver gradients smoothly blended across the leotard and skin, without visible banding or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gradients of blue and silver on the leotard and skin are illustrated with smooth transitions in color. This artistic style gives a sense of depth and dimension, which is achieved without visible color banding or unnatural highlights, maintaining an even visual flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the swirling ribbons and stars placed around the figure in a manner that follows the direction of movement and does not intersect with the body or balance beam?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ribbons and stars are stylistically placed to suggest motion around the gymnast. They do not intersect or obscure the figure or the balance beam, thus enhancing the dynamic feel of the image while preserving the clarity of the main subject.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the matt-finish panel with rounded corners fully visible around the image, without cutting off any part of the gymnast or background?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the gymnast's representation on a card-like format with rounded corners that are part of the artistic design. The corners and edges of the card are all visible, and importantly, no part of the gymnast or the decorative background is cut off or extends beyond these edges, ensuring the composition remains intact within the design limits.",
    "answer": "Yes"
