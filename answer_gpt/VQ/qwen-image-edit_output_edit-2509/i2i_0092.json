      "question": "Does the seaside café tabletop setting blend naturally with the table surface, avoiding any noticeable break in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop setting includes elements that should blend seamlessly with the table surface. When analyzing this aspect, we observe that the textures of the table surface and the placement of the phone holder and glass align well with the lighting and shadow details. The lighting appears consistent across these objects and the table surface, indicating there is no noticeable break in texture or lighting. Common sense dictates that natural blending would result in a harmonious continuity in appearance, which is present here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of sea waves and sunlight reflections accurately depicted, maintaining structural consistency without unnatural breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sea waves and sunlight reflections are visible on the phone screen. For accuracy in depiction, these elements should follow natural shapes and proportions observed in real-life scenarios. The waves appear fluid and follow natural curves, while the sunlight reflections align with typical reflections one would expect from sunlit waters. There is structural consistency without any visible unnatural breaks or distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials of the seaside elements, such as the table, sea waves, and sunlight reflections, appear authentic, free from unnatural textures and visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials and textures depicted in Image B, especially those of the table, sea waves, and sunlight reflections, are expected to mimic real-world appearances without introducing visual artifacts. The table exhibits natural wood grain, the sea waves show realistic fluid dynamics, and the sunlight reflections appear consistent with typical reflective patterns seen in natural sunlight. These elements appear authentic without noticeable visual artifacts, thus appearing naturally integrated.",

      "question": "Are the sunlight reflections on the sea waves consistent with the sun's expected position, maintaining physical logic and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight reflections on the sea waves are an important aspect to consider for visual credibility. These reflections should be consistent with the sun’s position as inferred from the overall brightness and angle of light. The reflections demonstrate an alignment with where sunlight commonly strikes moving water, maintaining expected reflection angle and brightness. This consistency with expected natural light behavior supports physical logic.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the seaside café setting fit naturally on the tabletop, enhancing the image's visual coherence without introducing distracting or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of elements on the tabletop includes the phone holder, glass of water, and scenery seen within the phone screen. To enhance the visual coherence, these elements need to interact seamlessly without disrupting visual flow. The objects are placed with logical spacing and orientation that aligns with the scene’s perspective, avoiding any visual distractions or misplacements. This composition contributes to the overall natural fit of the seaside café setting.",
