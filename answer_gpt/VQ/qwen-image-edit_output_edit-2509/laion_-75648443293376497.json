    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the leather texture across the backpack's main body appear uniformly consistent in grain, color, and thickness without unnatural seams or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the leather texture appears smooth and consistent throughout the main body of the backpack, with no visible seams or patches that disrupt the uniformity. The grain and color maintain a cohesive appearance, which resembles a typical leather finish. World knowledge suggests leather textures should be uniform for quality products. Thus, based on these observations, the leather texture maintains a consistent grain, color, and thickness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the buckle surfaces altered to display a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing and realistic light reflection, without deformed shapes or mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buckles in Image B exhibit a brass-like finish that includes both a tarnished appearance and reflective highlights consistent with metal surfaces. The shapes of the buckles are regular, without any signs of distortion, and the highlights align naturally, which supports the idea of a realistic metal surface finish based on typical metal appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the travel patches positioned on the side pockets with proper alignment to the stitching and fabric contours, showing no warping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows several travel patches on the side pockets which appear properly fixed to the contours of the fabric. The patches do not exhibit any warping or floating characteristics but instead align well with the natural curves and stitching lines of the pockets, indicating careful placement. Using world knowledge of fabric attachment, well-aligned patches should follow contours and avoid distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" text clearly visible on the front flap, properly aligned with the flapâ€™s curvature, and free from jagged edges or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' is prominently displayed on the front flap. It follows the curvature naturally, maintaining alignment and visibility. There is no presence of jagged edges or ghosting effects around the text, which suggests clean integration of text onto a curved leather surface, adhering to typical display norms.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the compass graphic near the base of the backpack rendered with fine, consistent lines that follow a circular pattern and do not distort the surrounding leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass graphic in Image B is drawn with fine, consistent lines in a circular pattern, featuring directions typically associated with compass designs. It is integrated well into the leather texture without causing distortion or misalignment in the leather surface, reflecting accurate graphic rendering based on the standards for graphic placement on textured materials.",
