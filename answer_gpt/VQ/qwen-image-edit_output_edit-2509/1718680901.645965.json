    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the spires and roof layers of the creature aligned with the original building's structure, showing no signs of bending, breaking, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When analyzing Image B, the creature integrated with the architectural spires and roof layers appears coherent. The design of the creature seems to mimic the building's structure in terms of spires and layering. Considering world knowledge about architectural design stability, this shows that the creature's features are well-integrated without any noticeable misalignment. Comparing with Image A, the edited image maintains the architectural continuity possibly intended by blending the building's design into the creature.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the orb at the creature’s feet feature pillars and arches that match the architectural style of the creature and have consistent texture and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orb is seen at the creature's feet, reflecting architectural elements like pillars and arches that match the styling of the building and creature. The texture and lighting on the orb are consistently applied, simulating the materials used in the rest of the image. The hues and shadows from the building and creature subtly mirror on the orb, showing thoughtful integration without spontaneous contrast.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the invented name displayed near the creature legible, properly sized, and positioned without overlapping the creature or water reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the name 'Mangster Catthing Eye' is positioned above the creature and does not overlap with it or the water reflection. It is legible and appropriately sized, suggesting careful placement in relation to the rest of the visual elements without causing distraction or confusion.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the elemental type label (e.g., Mystic, Stone) visible near the creature and styled to match the overall fantasy aesthetic without appearing digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elemental type label, 'Mystic Stone, Regal... 22', shares the same font and aesthetics as the name displayed, blending seamlessly with the image's fantasy theme. There is no indication that the label was added post-design; it maintains consistency in both style and color synchronization throughout the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature’s surface display smooth shading and consistent texture across all architectural elements, with no visible pixelation, blurring, or unnatural color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature’s surface demonstrates a blend of shades and textures reminiscent of the building's architecture, with smooth transitions and vivid details. No pixelation or blurring is noted, which shows quality spotlighting and detailed rendering of the architectural patterns without color inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the creature’s limbs proportionally sized and structurally connected to the main body in a way that suggests physical stability and logical weight distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature’s limbs in Image B are designed within proportion, connecting logically to the main body. The positioning suggests a sense of mass and stability as if the creature shares a solid architectural basis with the main edifice. The structure is aligned symmetrically showing a well-thought-out distribution of weight and stability, akin to sturdy architectural designs.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the water reflection accurately mirror the creature, orb, and any nearby text, showing correct orientation and lighting without warping or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection in the water, as seen in Image B, precisely mirrors the creature, orb, and text with accurate orientation and corresponding lighting effects. The reflection does not exhibit any distortion or ghosting, signifying a cohesive representation of the scene’s visual elements within the reflective surface.",
