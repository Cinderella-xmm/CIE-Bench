      "question": "Do the cascading arms and legs of the water elemental follow natural water flow patterns without abrupt breaks or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms and legs of the water elemental in Image B are designed to mimic the flow of water, with smooth curves and natural extensions that resemble how water might flow when unimpeded. The visual design shows continuity and fluidity without abrupt bends or breaks, ensuring that the elemental's limbs maintain a logical and aesthetic water-like pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the crystalline textures on the cliff faces varied in shape and size, and do they appear embedded within the rock rather than overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystalline structures have been added to the cliff faces. The crystals vary in shape and size, giving a more natural and realistic appearance. The integration into the landscape suggests they are embedded within the rock, which is visually consistent with how crystals might form naturally over time.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the glowing azure pattern emit a soft, diffused light that interacts with the surrounding rock and water without harsh edges or over-bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing azure patterns on the water elemental exhibit a soft, luminous quality, providing a gentle illumination to the surrounding areas. This subtle diffusion avoids harsh edges and overly bright areas, creating a pleasing visual effect that suggests a harmonious interaction with the environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mist and leaf crown transition smoothly from the solid canopy and appear anchored to the landscape with consistent depth and motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mist and leafy elements in Image B transition seamlessly from the solid canopy above, giving the impression that they are naturally arising from or connected to the landscape. This smooth transitioning and visual consistency in depth and motion enhance the cohesive integration of the elements into the environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the whirlpool eyes properly sized, located in a logical position within the waterfall, and do they show realistic spiral motion and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The whirlpool eyes, depicted on the water elemental, are appropriately sized and are located within the elemental's form rather than directly in the waterfall. They give the impression of realistic spiral dynamics, suggesting depth and movement consistent with natural whirlpool patterns. While they do not directly relate to the waterfall, they fit logically within the elemental's design.",
