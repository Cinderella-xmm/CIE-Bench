      "question": "Do the textures and materials of the baseball and glove appear natural and consistent in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, the textures of the baseball and glove maintain a detailed and realistic appearance. The leather of the glove appears consistent with the expected material quality, showcasing detailed stitching and leather gradients, and the baseball displays appropriate seams and leather texture. Using world knowledge about typical materials used in sporting goods, the depiction aligns with expectations for these objects. Therefore, the representation of materials and textures is consistent across various views.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the baseball and glove accurate and maintain their expected size relationships in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dimensions of the baseball and glove seem accurate. The glove is visibly larger than the baseball, which is consistent with real-world size relationships, as gloves are designed to comfortably catch and hold a standard baseball. This proportional accuracy is maintained across top, side, and sectional views, suggesting a correct representation of these objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, around the baseball or glove in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on an analysis of Image B, there are no apparent artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural blending around the outlines of the baseball and glove. The lines and contours appear smooth and coherent, consistent with well-rendered and high-quality illustrations, indicating no visual disturbances that would suggest poor editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove look natural and consistent with the lighting conditions in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the application of shadows and highlights follows the expected behavior under consistent lighting conditions. The areas intended to reflect more light appear highlighted appropriately, and the less exposed areas correctly show darker shading consistent with natural shadows. Thus, all three views maintain logical visual cues corresponding with realistic lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout in each of the three views (top, side, sectional) logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the baseball and glove in top, side, and sectional views, maintaining a credible and logical approach to illustrating these objects. The layout is coherent, representing a standard method of displaying objects in technical drawings or schematics to convey multiple perspectives. This enables a comprehensive understanding of the object's form and functionality, indicative of a logical composition.",
