    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the hat symmetrical and aligned with the brim and crown, without jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the hat have sharp, clean lines that follow the contours of the brim and crown. This indicates that the patterns are carefully crafted and do not exhibit jagged edges or broken lines. Using world knowledge, one expects high-quality pattern designs on hats to be symmetrical and properly aligned; this is evident in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the brim follow the contour of the hat and reflect light naturally, without appearing as flat or detached patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents on the hat’s brim appear to follow the natural curve of the hat and have a consistent shine that suggests a natural light reflection. This is analyzed by observing the uniformity and reflective quality of the gold, which would typically indicate a high-quality finish. Hence, they do not look like flat patches but rather integral parts of the hat design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise, cream, and silver motifs smoothly blended into the fabric, without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motifs in Image B, comprised of turquoise, cream, and silver, appear to be well-integrated into the hat, with no visible abrupt transitions or pixelation. This smooth blending of colors suggests high-quality fabric printing as seen in well-manufactured clothing items, where color transitions are seamless.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the hat avoid intersecting or distorting the natural wave and volume of the hair, maintaining clear separation between the two?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns remain on the surface of the hat without intruding on the hair. This indicates that there is clear separation between the hat and the hair. The design of fashion accessories often ensures that each element remains distinct to avoid visual clutter or distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shape of the hat’s brim and crown preserved with consistent thickness and curvature, without visible warping or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shape of the hat in Image B maintains a consistent and smooth curvature in both the brim and crown. This indicates that there is no visible warping or deformation. In fashion design, especially for hats, maintaining the structural integrity is crucial for aesthetic and functional purposes, and Image B adheres to these expectations.",
