    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi character maintain the same pose and clothing details as the original image without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character adopts a pose similar to that of Image A, with arms raised and one leg bent, capturing the essence of a martial arts stance. The clothing remains consistent with the originalâ€™s all-black attire. The transformation to a chibi style naturally involves the use of exaggerated and simplified features, common in such character design. The uniformity of the clothing is preserved without introducing unrealistic artifacts, staying true to the original posture.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi character's hands and legs match the original image without distortion?",
