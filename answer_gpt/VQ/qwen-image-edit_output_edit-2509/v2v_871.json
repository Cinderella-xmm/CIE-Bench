      "question": "Do the added LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design appear naturally integrated into the scene without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure and the pear-inspired animal design are within a glass cube with a wooden base. The integration into the scene is assessed by examining the presence of consistent lighting, shadows, and absence of visual aberrations or mismatched textures. Given that both figures share similar lighting and shading as their surroundings, and there are no visible edges or inconsistencies with the rest of the scene, they appear naturally integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design logically consistent with the size and scale of the pear and smartphone in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design are assessed in comparison to the known dimensions of a pear and smartphone. LEGO figures are generally smaller, and in this image, they appear proportionally reasonable if the glass cube is seen as a display case, typically scaled for such figures. The pear and smartphone size referentially allow this interpretation, confirming consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the glass cube, matte black base, and nameplate retain their natural appearance and fine details without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cube appears clear and reflects light naturally, characteristic of real glass. The matte black base has even coloration without streaks or pixelation, and the nameplate has crisp detailing which suggests high resolution. These observations indicate the materials and textures retain naturalness without artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the LEGO minifigure, pear-inspired animal, and nameplate within the transparent glass cube create a visually coherent and plausible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interior composition involves checking visual balance and logical arrangement. The minifigure and animal are placed in a manner suggesting intended display, typical in cases of collectibles. The nameplate is appropriately centered, maintaining a coherent composition within the visual and design norms of display cases, enhancing plausibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and background color transition from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone enhance the natural appearance and authenticity of the wooden surface and other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and gradient color background in Image B serve to create ambiance and depth, reinforcing realism. The transitions are smooth, complementing the tones of the wooden surface and tied into the overall aesthetic. This color harmony and lighting effect amplify the naturalness of depicted objects, enhancing both authenticity and visual appeal.",
