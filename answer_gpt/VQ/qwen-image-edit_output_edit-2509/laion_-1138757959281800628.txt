    "Question": "Q1: Are the corners and edges of the hotel building preserved with consistent angles and proportions, and is there a clear transparent boundary (glass) enclosing the scene without warping or breaking the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel is enclosed in a transparent glass box structure with clean and consistent angles, which clearly outlines the dimensions of the building. This box encapsulates the hotel in a way that maintains its proportions without any signs of distortion. The integrity of the glass is intact, with well-defined corners and smooth surfaces. Based on visual cues and understanding of structures encased in glass, there is no evidence of warping or breaking in the depiction of the building within the box.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the water layers in the pool show consistent transparency and refraction, allowing visibility of submerged objects and swimmers without jagged edges or color artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pool water appears to have a consistent transparency, revealing the submerged portion of the building and the pool area below. The edges where the water meets the solid surfaces are clean without any jaggedness. The clarity of the water allows for visibility of submerged items and swimmers, and there are no visible color artifacts present, indicating that the refraction is handled smoothly. This assessment uses the understanding of optical properties of water in contained environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the sunbathers on the lounge chairs have correctly proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, and do the nearby trees display natural leaf density and branching without pixelation or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts sunbathers that appear to be designed in a miniature or model-like style, lacking realistic detail typical of normal human figures. Their limbs are not proportioned naturally, and while clothing details might be suggested, they are generally not detailed. The trees, similarly, seem simplified in their depiction with uniform leaf density and structure. They lack the variance and detail expected in real-life trees and present a uniform texture, resembling synthetic or pixelated patterns.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the greenery flowing from the rooftop follow a continuous, downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points, and does it blend naturally with the building’s exterior without floating or clipping issues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the greenery on the rooftop is depicted as flowing vines that appear to cascade downward naturally with appropriate attachment points at the rooftop. The shadows cast by the greenery suggest a consistent light source and give a realistic depth to its descent over the building. The vines do not exhibit signs of floating or clipping, maintaining a natural appearance as part of the building's exterior. This judgment makes use of the natural laws of how plants behave and attach themselves to structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the beach accessories near the pool edge correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture, and do they have natural material textures (e.g., fabric, plastic)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beach accessories such as beach balls, chairs, and umbrellas appear to be designed to fit within the miniature or model-like setting. However, their sizes might not perfectly match real-world proportions, as they appear somewhat simplified. The textures also appear homogenous and are not realistic; they lack the distinctive textures seen in fabric or plastic materials. Although placed correctly on the ground, the simplified and model-like appearance does not replicate the realistic detail expected in natural material textures.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Do the floating 3D clouds exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene?",
    "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are rendered with a soft, fluffy appearance and smooth gradients, giving them a realistic, three-dimensional look. They are depicted as floating above the building, maintaining a position that doesn’t intersect with the building's structure itself. The lighting on the clouds matches the overall scene, complementing the lighting conditions on the building and surroundings, with subtle shadows indicating a coherent light source direction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
