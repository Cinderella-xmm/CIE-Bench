    "Question": "Q1: Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted as bursting out of the television screen, an effect achieved by the representation of broken glass and digital elements around the character. The edges of the screen breakage appear sharp and natural, matching common visual effects used in media to simulate such an occurrence. This suggests that there are no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures at the boundary.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the addition of the character breaking out of the screen maintain the visual continuity of the background and avoid disrupting other elements in the scene?",
    "explanation": "The composition in Image B is carefully designed, such that the character’s emergence from the screen integrates into the digital-themed backdrop, with elements like broken glass adding to the effect without overwhelming the scene. The disruption is intentional and artistic, maintaining visual continuity as intended.",
