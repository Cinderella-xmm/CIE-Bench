      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature robot model is a scaled-down version of the original robot in Image A. The visual cues such as the structure of limbs and joints seem to maintain proportional accuracy based on a typical scaling down process. The body parts appear to retain their geometric shapes without any visible misalignment or distortion, indicating a careful replication of the original into a miniaturized form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular display case appears transparent and exhibits smooth, clean edges, with the light interacting naturally across its surface. There are no visible jagged edges or artifacts, which would suggest issues with rendering or image editing. The absence of these visual inconsistencies suggests a well-rendered transparent case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robotâ€™s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The details on the robot model in Image B, including potential tiny gears or mechanical details visible under transparent panels, appear to be correctly aligned with the robot's surface. There are no visible signs of overlapping or floating errors which would indicate improper placement or rendering. This suggests careful attention to detail, maintaining the complexity and alignment found in miniature replicas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hexagonal base that possesses a uniform, matte-black finish, indicative of precise geometric rendering with clean edges. The model number text is sharp and appears to illuminate evenly, showing no signs of haloing or distortion, demonstrating proper design and legible inscription.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape in Image B includes elements like tiny trees and ground textures scaled proportionally to the miniature model size, contributing to a coherent spatial composition. The landscape features are consistent with the display case size, and, while there is no notable cityscape visible in Image B, the context logically aligns with the need to ensure spatial consistency in scale and positioning around the presentation.",
