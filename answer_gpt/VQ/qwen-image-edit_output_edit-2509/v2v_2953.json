      "question": "Does the claymation texture applied to the cocktail glass maintain its structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cocktail glass in Image B has a claymation texture, evidenced by the uneven, stylized surface resembling clay rather than a smooth glass finish. The details like the cube patterns mimic the original but are simplified to suit the claymation style. While the stylistic change introduces a texture typical for clay objects, it does maintain structural coherence, adapting the shapes faithfully without introducing unnatural elements. The reasoning is based on the consistent artistic method known in claymation design, which simplifies details while preserving shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ice cubes and liquid in the cocktail retain their visual plausibility and natural appearance after being converted into a claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes and liquid have been transformed into claymation style. The cubes are blocky and solid, while the liquid appears to be a solid poured clay shape rather than a transparent liquid. In claymation, realistic transparency isn't achievable, affecting their natural appearance. Given that they look more like part of the cup rather than separate entities, the conversion loses some visual plausibility typical of real ice and liquid.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the lime slice and straw preserved without distortion in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime slice and straw maintain their geometric integrity, with the lime retaining its wedge shape and the straw its cylindrical form. The claymation style simplifies the textures, but the fundamental shapes are clearly recognizable and undistorted. This is indicative of good claymation practices, where essential shapes are maintained even if surface details are minimized.",

      "question": "Does the background, including the bar counter and bottles, retain its structural integrity and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B, consisting of a bar counter and bottles, is consistent with the claymation theme. The bottles are rendered in simplified, untextured forms with solid colors, distinguishing them from realistic representations but maintaining a coherent visual style typical of claymation. Structural integrity is observed, as there are no disjointed elements that would be considered unnatural for a clay environment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects logically consistent in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects appear to be consistent with those in a realistic setting, even when rendered in claymation style. The size of the glass relative to the napkin and the positioning on the bar counter retains logical proportions, which is crucial in maintaining a believable setting, despite the stylistic change.",
