    "Question": "Q1: Are the stripes on the zebra sharp and distinct without any unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are sharp and distinct. There are no apparent signs of pixelation or blurring, which might indicate poor image editing or low resolution. The clarity of the stripes suggests that the editing process has maintained the natural appearance of a zebra's fur pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the zebra's fur textures appear natural without any visible artificial streaks or patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's fur textures appear natural, without any visible artificial streaks or patterns. The stripes follow the natural curvature of the zebra's body, and there are no signs of artificial manipulation, such as repetitive patterns or inconsistencies in texture, which would suggest an unnatural editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions of the zebra's body consistent and free from any geometric distortions like warping or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the zebra's body seem consistent and correct, with no evidence of geometric distortion such as warping or stretching. The zebra appears in a natural posture that aligns with its expected anatomy, suggesting that the image has been edited carefully to preserve these attributes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the relative position between the zebra and the background grassland remain unchanged and natural?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is notably positioned on a metal platform with a cityscape background, contrasting with Image A where the zebra is on open grassland. Therefore, the relative position between the zebra and the background in Image B is both changed and unnatural as it diverges significantly from a typical grassland scene.",
    "answer": "No"
},

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the grass blades and the zebra's hooves detailed and free from any loss of sharpness or introduction of noise?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene lacks the clear visibility of grass blades altogether due to the presence of a metallic platform. However, focusing on the zebra's hooves, they remain detailed and sharp without noticeable noise, suggesting that the editing process has maintained the clarity of the foreground subject despite the change in scenery.",
    "answer": "Yes"
