    "Question": "Q1: Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, it is clear that the sofa maintains a consistent front view perspective with no visible distortions or unusual geometric shapes. The proportions, such as the height and width of the cushions and the distance between the legs, appear balanced and normal. Given this observation, and since there is no side view depicted in Image B, it is concluded that the sofa maintains its structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric of the sofa is shown from a front view, displaying consistent texture and detail. The stitching, cushion seams, and fabric appear even and natural. As there is no side view in Image B, it's assumed that this consistency holds true across the unseen angles as well.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
    "explanation": "In the front view of Image B, the cushions and legs are aligned properly. The position of the cushions and their relation to the legs present a natural and plausible appearance for this view. Since there is no side view presented, it is assumed that this alignment would be natural if viewed from other angles as well.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B creates shadows on the left side, consistent with a light source originating from the right. This analysis of lighting effects shows natural distribution and consistency within the front view presented in Image B. There is no transition to side view, so consistency is assumed based on the visible view.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
    "explanation": "The artwork in Image B presents vivid colors and realistic brush strokes that give it a tactile appearance. The wall shows no distortions or irregularities in its texture or alignment with the artwork. As such details are clear in the front view, and assuming the same quality holds even if other views existed, it is reasonable to conclude they retain a natural and realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
