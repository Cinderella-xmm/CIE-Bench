    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style warrior retain the long hair and muscled neckline with proportional scaling and without unnatural deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style warrior figure maintains the long white hair seen on the creature from Image A. The hair is stylized but doesn't appear unnaturally deformed, fitting the chibi aesthetic which often includes exaggerated features like larger heads or smaller bodies while maintaining realistic proportions for the hair and neck. The neckline and armor suggest a muscled build. Given the style, the scaling seems proportional for a chibi design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the icy armor transparent with visible internal reflections and no solid or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "The icy armor in Image B exhibits a solid, metallic appearance with some reflective qualities. However, the armor does not appear transparent. The edges are smooth, lacking any jagged or pixelated lines that would indicate digital artifacting. This suggests a stylized representation of ice without focusing on transparency.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the ice shards evenly distributed around the figure, small enough to fit the snow globe scale, and textured like real ice without repeating patterns or floating anomalies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ice shards are positioned symmetrically around the chibi figure within the snow globe, appropriately scaled to fit within the globe. The shards are designed to have a crystalline appearance, with no visibly repeating patterns or floating anomalies, resembling stylized but consistent ice textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the terrain beneath the figure composed of jagged, snow-covered rocks with realistic texture and shadowing, and does the figure rest securely on it without appearing suspended?",
    "explanation": "The terrain inside the snow globe in Image B appears to be a smooth, snowy surface rather than jagged rocks. The figure is positioned securely on this surface, with no visible suspension. The texture and shadowing provide a soft, snowy look rather than a rocky texture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wooden base have consistent wood texture, visible grain, and clearly defined runes that do not appear pixelated or digitally overlaid?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base of the snow globe displays intricate, clearly defined runes around the edge. The wood texture shows a consistent grain pattern, enhancing realism. The design does not appear pixelated, indicating a high-quality rendering without digital overlay issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the snow globe's surface smooth and transparent, with no visible seams or distortions that affect the internal elements' appearance?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B has a smooth, transparent surface that allows clear visibility of the figure and internal elements. There are no visible seams or distortions that interrupt the view, maintaining a cohesive and polished appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the chibi version of the figure’s face preserve the original’s blue eyes, white hair, and facial structure in a simplified but identifiable manner?",
    "explanation": "The chibi figure's face is blurred, so facial features like blue eyes and specific facial structure cannot be assessed. However, the white hair is evident and maintained in the chibi design.",
    "answer": "No"
