      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied to the octopus uniformly distributed without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is shown with a smooth transition of pastel colors, typical of many illustrative styles where colors blend seamlessly to create a visually appealing effect. There are no abrupt shifts or noticeable pixelated edges, which is often observed in digital art intended to be smooth and inviting. The analysis involves observing the surface of the octopus to ensure that the color transitions are consistent and without pixelation.",

      "question": "Do the brush outlines around the octopus follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles without overlapping or breaking at joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outlines in Image B are smooth and follow the natural curves of the octopus's body and tentacles. This can be observed where the tentacles curve and twist, and the lines match these movements closely, suggesting a careful adherence to the organic form of the octopus without overlapping or breaking at joints. Illustrations are typically created to maintain continuity and follow anatomical features naturally.",

      "question": "Are the waves near the shore smooth and consistent in shape, showing natural foam patterns without jagged or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves depicted near the shore are illustrated with smooth and consistent shapes, providing a stylized representation of water. The foam patterns are natural, coherent, and lack any jagged or broken textures which can disrupt the aesthetic seamlessness of the illustration. The depiction follows artistic norms to create visually appealing water movements.",

      "question": "Is the text positioned above the horizon line without intersecting clouds or causing visible distortion in the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is strategically placed above the horizon line within the sky area, maintaining a clear separation from the clouds and keeping the visual focus on the text without causing distortion to the background sky. Text positioning in such posters usually follows design principles to enhance readability and maintain background integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain align with the direction of the sunset light source and maintain depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while it's difficult to assess specific shadow details due to the illustrative nature of the artwork, typically shadows in illustrations are simplified to maintain visual appeal rather than realistic depth perception. The depiction of shadows suggests consistency with an assumed low angle sunset light source, aligning in direction relative to the illustration style, prioritizing visual uniformity over nuanced depth perception.",
