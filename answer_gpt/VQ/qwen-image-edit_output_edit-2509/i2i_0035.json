      "question": "Are the colors of the salad, milk carton, chicken parmesan, and oranges enhanced in a way that appears natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the salad, milk carton, chicken parmesan, and oranges appear vibrant yet natural. The greens of the salad look fresh, the milk carton's color is consistent with a real milk carton, the cheese and sauce on the chicken parmesan have realistic tones, and the oranges are bright but not overly saturated. These elements reflect natural coloring without any noticeable artifacts that would suggest artificial enhancement.",

      "question": "Does the added title \"Today’s Balanced Lunch\" blend naturally into the image without breaking the structural consistency or introducing any distorted elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added title 'Today’s Balanced Lunch' in Image B is positioned at the top in a way that it complements the image's composition. The font and color scheme are chosen to contrast against the background without clashing with other elements. There are no inconsistencies or distortions introduced by this text addition, and it seems seamlessly integrated into the layout.",

      "question": "Do the white outlines applied to the edges of the plate, food items, and text enhance the visual clarity without creating unnatural textures or degrading fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a subtle white outline effect is present that helps to define the boundaries of the plate, food items, and text. The application of these outlines is done in moderation, enhancing the overall clarity and making the elements stand out, particularly against the background. There are no obvious signs of degradation or unnatural textures caused by these outlines.",

      "question": "Is the placeholder for the school logo placed at the bottom right corner with appropriate size and proportion, ensuring it fits naturally within the layout without disrupting the overall balance of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The school logo placeholder in Image B is positioned at the bottom right corner of the image. It is proportionate in size, ensuring it does not overpower other elements. Its placement is strategic, leaving ample space around it to maintain the image's overall balance and layout consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the image been resized and formatted for an A4 vertical layout in a manner that preserves the natural proportions and structural consistency of the plate, food items, and text elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the layout suggests an adaptation to a vertical format by inclusion of vertical elements (like title and logo), the core elements such as the plate with food maintain their original proportions and consistency. The text and logo are aligned to accommodate this format, suggesting that the image fits an A4 vertical layout naturally, without distortion.",
