      "question": "Do the books and diploma held by the owl appear to integrate seamlessly with the owl's body without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the diploma and books appear well-integrated with the owl figure, resembling realistic LEGO elements. The seamless integration and lack of visible artifacts are typical of well-executed digital renderings. This understanding comes from recognizing common characteristics of digitally rendered and sculpted figures where multiple pieces coalesce smoothly without texture conflicts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the graduation cap on the owl's head maintain the structural integrity of the owl's head, avoiding any distortion or unnatural geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The graduation cap on the owl in Image B maintains structural integrity, fitting well on the owl's head, which is characteristic of digital 3D designs that adhere to proportional integrity consistent with the surrounding components. This observation is informed by recognizing CGI characteristics where elements are typically proportionate and geometrically sensible.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the owl's feathers and eyes free from any loss of detail or unnatural textures, preserving their original quality and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the owl's face is deliberately blurred, the rest of the owl's body—particularly the feathers—shows attention to textural detail typical of sculpted LEGO-like representations, maintaining a consistent level of detail without losing textural fidelity in the unblurred areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the image enhance the details of the owl and the added elements without creating any unnatural shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears well-calibrated, enhancing the details without introducing excessive shadows or highlights, allowing elements like the owl and books to appear consistently well-lit and realistic, a trait of controlled digital illustration or rendering practices.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the books beneath the owl free from any unnatural textures or distortions, maintaining a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The books in Image B are depicted with smooth textures, consistent with the standardized appearance of sculpted or LEGO-like digital models. They do not show distortions and maintain the realistic appearance typical in digitally designed models, ensuring uniform texture representation.",
