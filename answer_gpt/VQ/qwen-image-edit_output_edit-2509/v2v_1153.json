      "question": "Do the transformed buildings exhibit smooth, metallic textures without unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings have been transformed to display a futuristic style, featuring sleek, metallic textures. The reflective surfaces and the sci-fi elements on the buildings suggest a coherent metallic appearance. The image shows clear and well-defined lines, typical of metallic structures, without noticeable pixelation or blurring. This implies the transformation has achieved a visually smooth texture.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom trees and traditional architectural features like the pagoda seamlessly integrated with the futuristic buildings without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene where traditional and futuristic elements coexist. The cherry blossom trees and the pagoda are traditional, while the surrounding buildings are futuristic. Despite this contrast, both the cherry blossoms and traditional structures are visually well-integrated with the modern ones. The color palettes complement each other, and the composition harmonizes these elements, making them appear part of a coherent design.",

      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the buildings been preserved logically, ensuring no broken or distorted geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the futuristic buildings maintain logical geometric shapes and proportions. The symmetric layout and proportional scaling suggest careful attention to architectural consistency, avoiding distorted forms. The buildings have a structured and coherent arrangement, indicative of realistic architectural designs.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the buildings, such as window frames and roof edges, clearly visible and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The futuristic buildings in Image B show detailed elements like window frames and roof edges, which are sharp and distinct. The clarity of these details and the absence of aberrant textures highlight a sophisticated rendering of fine architectural elements. The design continuity suggests high-quality detailing without visual errors.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B achieves a balanced and harmonious visual composition by blending futuristic architecture with natural elements like cherry blossoms. The layout feels intentional, with even distribution and thoughtful integration of elements maintaining visual balance. The overall scene creates a credible and aesthetically pleasing depiction within the context of a futuristic setting.",
