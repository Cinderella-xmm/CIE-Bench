    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brushstrokes applied to the man’s clothing and headwrap consistent in direction and intensity, maintaining the pattern’s integrity without distorting the fabric’s shape or introducing pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstrokes visibly align uniformly throughout the man's clothing and headwrap, showcasing uniform direction and intensity. These strokes effectively keep the bold pattern's integrity, as per traditional African attire. The brushstrokes accentuate the colorful designs without any visible distortion or smudging that might compromise the vibrancy or shape of the fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the background blur smooth and uniform across the horizon, with no jagged edges, double contours, or inconsistent color patches that break the continuity of the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background showcases a fluid and cohesive application of paint, mimicking a Van Gogh-inspired style. This is achieved through consistent brushwork, transitioning smoothly across the horizon without breaks, jagged artifacts, or color patch interruptions. The landscape flows seamlessly, capturing the essence of a gently undulating terrain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the drum retain its circular shape and consistent rim structure, with paint layers applied in a way that follows the curvature without flattening or stretching the surface unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drum exhibits a maintained circular form with its rim structure clearly defined. The paint layers are attentively applied, preserving the drum's curvature, a characteristic essential for a realistic portrayal. The strokes do not disrupt the circular geometry or impart any flattening or elongation impact, thus maintaining the instrument's authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the stylized grass and tree forms elongated or curved in a way that suggests motion but still preserve recognizable plant structures, such as upright trunks and branching patterns, without appearing fragmented or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass and tree forms are depicted with brushstrokes that suggest a sense of flowing motion, typical of impressionistic styles. Despite this stylistic choice, the vegetation retains recognizable characteristics. Trees maintain their structure with upright trunks and visible branches, and the grass, though appearing slightly elongated, conveys a coherent idea of a landscape without fragmentation or floating elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display five distinct fingers with anatomically correct spacing and joint alignment, and are the fingers proportionally sized relative to the arms and drum without appearing stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents both hands with clarity, each exhibiting five distinctly visible fingers. The anatomical alignment of joints is precise, with appropriate spacing, presenting a correct ergonomic relationship among fingers, arms, and the drum. This attention to detail ensures the fingers appear proportionate and naturally positioned, avoiding any semblance of distortion.",
