      "question": "Do the vertical towers now resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture and leaf coverage, without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the previously geometric and metallic structure of the vertical towers has been transformed to mimic organic, tree-like limbs. These limbs have a bark texture and are covered with foliage, seamlessly integrating into the forest surroundings. There are no visible seams or distortions, which adds to the natural appearance. The transformation effectively replaces the rigid engineering structure with a design that exhibits natural textures and forms as seen in nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches now formed into a continuous ribcage structure with natural curvature and spacing, free from broken or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arches in Image B have been edited to resemble a ribcage structure, which is continuous and evenly spaced, mimicking what one might find in skeletal formations in nature. This transformation involves a smooth and coherent design, free from interruptions or misalignments, differentiating it from any previous segmented or geometrically repetitive pattern evident in man-made constructions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the suspension cables been replaced with vine-like tendrils that show natural growth patterns, such as twisting or clinging, and do they blend with the forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suspension cables from Image A have been replaced with tendrils that resemble vines. These vine-like structures exhibit natural growth patterns, such as twisting and clinging to surrounding elements. They appear integrated into the forest environment, suggesting an organic origin and blending harmoniously with the forest setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bridgeâ€™s foundations now consist of moss-covered roots extending into the stream, with natural branching and tapering, rather than solid stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the foundations of the bridge have been creatively modified to resemble roots, covered in moss, extending into the water. Unlike the solid stone foundations in Image A, these edited features display characteristics of natural roots, including branching and tapering, integrating it into the forest floor and stream naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bark-textured head structure with two glowing emerald eyes positioned at the top of the bridge, with the glow confined and not causing light bleed or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the location that previously featured structural elements, a transformed head structure composed of bark textures, with two distinct glowing emerald eyes, is visible. The lighting of the eyes is confined and controlled, ensuring that there is no excessive light bleed or unnatural highlights affecting the surrounding area, which is consistent with a controlled luminous effect typically added for emphasis in digital artwork.",
