    "Question": "Q1: Do the biscuit panels on the building walls exhibit uniform texture and color without visible cracks, patches, or unnatural grain patterns?",
    "explanation": "The biscuit panels on the building walls in Image B appear to be crafted with a consistent texture and color. In gingerbread house designs, uniformity is typically achieved by carefully cutting and baking the dough, ensuring that there are no cracks or irregularities. The visual appearance of these panels shows no evident defects such as patches or inconsistent textures that would indicate damage or poor design, reflecting a well-crafted gingerbread facade.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the sugar-glazed dome smoothly curved with consistent color and reflective properties, and does it align correctly with the base structure without appearing warped or misproportioned?",
    "explanation": "The dome on the gingerbread building in Image B is smoothly curved, and its sugar glaze exhibits a consistent color and slight sheen that is typical of sugary decorations. Its alignment with the base structure appears proportionate and symmetrical, without any indication of warping or disconnect. A well-made gingerbread dome would naturally reflect such characteristics, ensuring a realistic and aesthetically pleasing appearance.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the icing patterns on the windows and doors clearly defined, evenly applied, and positioned within the frame boundaries without overlapping or deforming the original window/door shapes?",
    "explanation": "The icing patterns in Image B are neatly applied and follow the contours of the windows and doors precisely. They are clearly defined without blurring and are within their respective frames, maintaining the integrity of the shapes. Correct icing application on a gingerbread house involves careful piping to avoid overlap or distortion, ensuring that the decorative elements complement the underlying structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the tree trunks and branches maintain natural branching patterns, and are the sugar-coated leaves evenly distributed without clumping or floating effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks and branches mimic natural growth patterns, with branches extending outward from the trunk in a realistic manner. The sugar-coated leaves are evenly distributed along the branches, without any unnatural clustering or floating appearance. Such even distribution and natural patterns suggest a meticulous attention to detail, typical in crafted edible decorations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the marble slab extend continuously under the building and surrounding area, with consistent lighting and reflection, and no visible gaps or distortions at the edges?",
    "explanation": "The marble slab in Image B appears to extend seamlessly beneath the gingerbread building and its immediate surrounding area. The lighting and reflection on the marble surface are consistent across its visible extent, lacking any noticeable gaps or distortions that could disrupt the slab's continuity. This creates a realistic base, as expected in well-rendered or designed settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
