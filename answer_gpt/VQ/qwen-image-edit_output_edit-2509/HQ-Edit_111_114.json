      "question": "Are the limbs of the man and the components of the scooter proportionally coherent and free from geometric distortion such as elongated arms, bent knees, or misaligned wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's proportions and the scooter's components appear natural and proportional. The arms are appropriately aligned, the knees are not bent awkwardly, and the wheels are not misaligned, suggesting a realistic depiction without geometric distortion. Based on the visual cues and common knowledge of human and scooter anatomy, the proportions are coherent.",

      "question": "Do the sepia tones cover all areas evenly without visible color banding, blotchy patches, or loss of detail in textures like fabric, stone, or foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes sepia tones uniformly across the image. The texture of the fabrics, the cobblestone pavement, and foliage details remain clear and distinguishable without color banding or blotchiness. The sepia effect is consistent, maintaining detailed textures effectively.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges transition smoothly into the white background. There are no abrupt lines or masking artifacts, indicating a well-executed fading effect that creates a coherent and aesthetic border.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The art-nouveau frame in Image B is placed effectively around the primary image without any overlap or intrusion into the scene depicted. It doesn't interfere with the scooter or background structures, ensuring the integrity of the visual elements within the frame.",

      "question": "Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blank writing area is well-aligned directly beneath the primary image. It is horizontally level and does not interfere with the scooter's base or the ground line, providing a clean area for writing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment texture in Image B is evenly distributed without affecting the clarity of fine details. There is no blurring or ghosting that obscures elements like the man's beard or window shutters, indicating a consistent application of texture.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcards are depicted in a realistic stack with visible shadows and overlapping edges. However, there is no visible twine wrapped around them, which would suggest physical binding. Therefore, the depiction falls slightly short of conveying a fully realistic physical set of postcards.",
