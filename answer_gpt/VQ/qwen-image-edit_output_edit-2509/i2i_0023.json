      "question": "Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy's head appears slightly enlarged compared to the birds, creating a caricature or cartoon-like appearance consistent with stylized illustrations. In stylized art, proportions often deviate from real-world norms, but are typically adjusted to maintain coherence and avoid noticeable distortion relative to each other. Given Image B's artistic style, the enlarged boy's head and shrunken birds are proportionate and structurally coherent within this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the block colors used for the boy's skin tone and feather textures appear clean and uniform, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a distinct approach using block colors for the boy's skin tone and bird textures, typical in vector art or simplistic graphic design. These colors are applied evenly and uniformly, with no gradients or shading, which fits within the style's aesthetic preferences. There are no visible unnatural artifacts as block colors are intended to simplify and unify colors inside the art style used.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the white outlines around the boy and birds smooth and consistent, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "White outlines are a defining feature in stylized or vector illustrations to separate elements clearly. In Image B, these outlines are consistently smooth, with no evidence of jagged edges or breaks, ensuring coherence and clarity in element separation, which enhances the overall clean aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds are transformed into minimalist illustrations lacking intricate details. While 'fine details' are abstractly retained through color and form representation, the texture resembles flat color blocks typical in simplified vector graphics. They do not appear pixelated as the intent is for clarity through simplification rather than high detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition with the enlarged boy's head and shrunken birds appear balanced and neatly arranged, providing visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a strategic arrangement with the boy central and birds evenly distributed around him, contributing to balanced composition. The enlarged head, symbolic positioning and uniformed spacing among the elements provide a neat and visually credible integration aligned with artistic design conventions.",
