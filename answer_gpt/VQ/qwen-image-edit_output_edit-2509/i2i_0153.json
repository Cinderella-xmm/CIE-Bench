      "question": "Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a cartoon-style truck, where the proportions and geometric shapes are simplified intentionally as part of the art style. Unlike Image A, which shows a realistic truck with precise proportions, Image B is designed with exaggerated features typical of cartoon illustrations, but still maintains a coherent appearance without any broken geometric shapes. The truck appears proportionally correct for its cartoon design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish style simplifies surfaces and textures significantly, eliminating realistic details like metallic reflections and intricate patterns seen in Image A. Instead, smooth color fillings and simplistic lines replace realistic textures, aligning with cartoon aesthetics. There are no unnatural artifacts within this art style, and the level of detail corresponds with typical cartoon production, fitting expectations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bright, solid colors for the truck's cab without gradients or realistic lighting effects. While this might not match material colors found in reality, cartoons typically employ vivid colors without concern for realistic contrast. Such choices feel consistent within the context of a cartoon, avoiding abrupt or unnatural contrasts against the truck's other elements. The red cab is uniformly colored, consistent with its artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features simple trees and a clear sky, matching the cartoon style of the truck. Compared to the realistic setting in Image A, which has detailed foliage and lighting conditions, Image B's background complements the truck in style and simplicity, preserving scene authenticity within the cartoon context. There are no distracting or inconsistent elements that disrupt the visual harmony between the truck and its surroundings.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the truck's wheels in a simple, round form without signs of distortion or misalignment. While lacking the intricate details of tread and reflections seen in Image A, the wheels in Image B are structurally logical for a cartoon truck design. They appear properly positioned relative to the truck body, supporting the overall visual credibility within its stylized context.",
