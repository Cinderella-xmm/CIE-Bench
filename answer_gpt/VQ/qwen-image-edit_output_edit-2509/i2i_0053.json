      "question": "Do the bananas retain a natural curvature and texture, avoiding any obvious distortion or unnatural shapes after being redrawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are drawn with a smooth, consistent curve that is typical of the natural shape of bananas. The redrawn image simplifies the texture to fit a cartoon style, but the overall shape retains the recognizable form of bananas. The curvature looks natural; therefore, even with the cartoon simplification, there is no obvious distortion or unnatural shape.",

      "question": "Does the wooden base and metal stand preserve their material properties and structural coherence, without introducing unnatural textures or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base and metal stand are redrawn in a simplified cartoon style, which inherently lacks the textural nuance present in real materials. However, their shapes are maintained without breaking geometric coherenceâ€”the base looks circular and planar, and the metal stand retains its arch shape. The simplification does not introduce distortion; the coherent structure helps maintain material recognition.",

      "question": "Are the bold outlines around the bananas and stand clear and consistent, contributing to the chibi-style aesthetic without being overly thick or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines are indeed bold, clear, and consistent. These lines fit the chibi-style aesthetic, maintaining a playful and cartoonish appearance. They are neither overly thick nor uneven, allowing for pleasant visual continuity and coherence across the image.",

      "question": "Does the green hill background integrate seamlessly with the foreground elements, maintaining proportional logic and visual coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green hill background is drawn in a simple, cartoonish style that complements the foreground elements. It does not appear out of place as it matches the overall color palette and aesthetic theme, giving a light-hearted and balanced composition. The proportional logic with the elements in the image keeps everything cohesive visually.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details on the bananas, such as the tips and edges, been preserved in the cartoon redraw, avoiding any loss or distortion that affects the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fine details such as the tips and edges of the bananas are less pronounced due to the chibi-style simplification, which is typical of such artistic choices. While the details are simplified, the bananas' defining features, like shape and orientation, are preserved in a way that maintains their recognizable appearance in the context of the cartoon style. However, the reduced detail is consistent with the artistic style and does not distort their natural appearance.",
