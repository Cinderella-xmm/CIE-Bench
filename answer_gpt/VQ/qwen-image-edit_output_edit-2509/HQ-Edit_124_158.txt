    "Question": "Q2: Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet and wood materials of the settee exhibit realistic textures that align with real-world objects. The velvet shows a rich, plush texture with consistent lighting, and the wood has intricate detailing that reflects light accurately, without pixelation or visible seams that would disrupt the illusion of realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "The velvet curtains in Image B display plausible fold patterns indicative of real fabric behavior. They cast soft shadows that contribute to the scene's depth and are seamlessly integrated into the background, showing no signs of floating or misalignment that would break the immersion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The gilded columns in Image B are well-scaled and aligned with the perspective of the scene, enhancing the sense of depth and dimensionality. They possess reflective surfaces that interact naturally with the ambient lighting, without any observable artifacts such as blurring or jagged edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hanging mouse portraits are distinct and appropriately sized within the context of the scene. They appear to be supported by strings, casting realistic shadows that ground them within the scene, free from visual glitches or texture errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
