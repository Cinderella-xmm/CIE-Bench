    "Question": "Q2: Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seated figureâ€™s limbs and joints are portrayed in a cartoonish manner, especially since it features exaggerated eyes which is common in caricature styles. This artistic choice can lead to some anatomical distortion. However, the limbs do not exhibit severe distortion in angles or lengths that break the cartoon's stylistic element. As the figure is cartoonish yet proportionate within its style, the limbs appear to be in line with this approach.",
