      "question": "Does the added poem text blend naturally with the image without causing any visible distortion to the background or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the poem text has been added to the bottom right corner. The addition of text does not alter or distort the background or the subject (the bird and branch), indicating that the integration has been performed cleanly. The image remains intact, suggesting the text blends well into the background without introducing visual distortions to the crucial elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is positioned in the bottom right corner, away from the primary subject of the bird perched on the branch which is on the left. This placement ensures that the text does not cover any vital parts of the bird or the branch, maintaining the image's structural consistency and allowing for uninterrupted viewing of the main subject.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the font and size of the added poem text appropriate, maintaining readability while not overpowering the natural elements of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font size and style used in Image B are appropriate; they are clearly readable against the relatively uniform and darker background in the bottom right corner. Additionally, the text remains subtle enough to not overshadow the vibrant and detailed subject (the yellow bird), thus maintaining a balance between readability and visual dominance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the added poem text exhibit a smooth texture that aligns with the lighting and shadow of the original image, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The poem text appears to be smoothly integrated into the scene, without any visible signs of pixelation or incongruous texture. The lighting in the text area seems consistent with the rest of the image, as it does not clash with the ambient lighting and shadows, resulting in a seamless addition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the final composition, including the added poem text, retain a balanced and harmonious visual layout without disrupting the natural feel of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the poem text at the lower corner of Image B complements the existing visual flow, maintaining balance without drawing excessive focus away from the bird. The harmonious placement and well-matched font style and color contribute to preserving the natural aesthetic of the image, achieving a balanced composition.",
