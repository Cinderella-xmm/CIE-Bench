      "question": "Does the marble texture beneath the teapot exhibit natural veining and color variation without abrupt edges or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble texture in Image B appears smooth with natural veining patterns typical of real marble surfaces. This natural pattern includes color variations and subtle transitions without any abrupt edges or repetitive artificial patterns that would suggest a digitally manipulated texture. The veining follows unpredictable paths and fades naturally into the surrounding surface, which is characteristic of genuine marble.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transparent label positioned on the teapotâ€™s body with uniform opacity and no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the label on the teapot appears to have consistent and uniform opacity across its surface, matching the material properties of the metal it is applied to. There is no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges, meaning the text is clear and sharp, indicating a clean integration without digital artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the gold monogram on the lid align with the surrounding engravings in terms of depth, shadow, and metallic finish, without appearing raised or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold monogram on the lid in Image B is in harmony with the surrounding engravings. It maintains a consistent metallic finish that matches the reflective and shadow characteristics of the lid. This alignment suggests that the monogram is well-integrated and does not appear raised or superficially applied, maintaining depth uniformity with the existing designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the box positioned adjacent to the teapot with correct perspective and scale, and does it feature consistent engraving patterns and material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box is positioned next to the teapot with a perspective that aligns correctly with the teapot's placement. The relative size and proportions of both objects suggest a realistic scale. Additionally, the box features consistent engraving patterns that match the material appearance of the teapot, creating a cohesive visual style and suggesting they belong to the same product line.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the teapot and box consistent with the light source direction and do they match the ambient lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows cast by the teapot and the box in Image B correspond well with the light source direction, as evidenced by their positions and lengths. Both shadows are indicative of a single light source and they complement the overall ambient lighting, neither too sharp nor too diffuse, maintaining coherence with the scene's illumination.",
