      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the scarecrow’s body exhibit a consistent glossy finish across all areas where straw was replaced, without visible seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the packaging of a Halloween set with a scarecrow illustration. Since the focus is on the packaging, the image does not explicitly depict the scarecrow outside of the box to evaluate any finish changes or material replacements on its body. Therefore, the information to conclude about the presence of a glossy finish or any texture mismatches on the scarecrow's body outside of the illustration isn’t available through visible analysis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hat structurally intact and proportionally consistent with the original, featuring a clearly defined opening at the top that allows for candle placement without distorting its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarecrow's hat in Image B is shown on the packaging illustration, and there is no additional depiction of a hat directly associated with a candle placement feature. The clear defined opening relevant for a candle placement is not visible or discussed; the candle visible is placed in a separate glass holder with its own mini-hat accessory. There’s no connection indicating that this is directly related to the scarecrow’s hat.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LED string lights positioned along the scarecrow or packaging in a way that emits soft, localized light without causing unnatural bright spots, flickering effects, or visible wiring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LED string lights are placed around the box. The light emitted appears soft and localized, providing subtle illumination that enhances the scene without creating unnatural bright spots or visible wiring. The string lights complement the packaging aesthetically, suggesting a deliberate and well-distributed light placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crow figurine resting stably on the top edge of the box, aligned with gravitational logic, and matching the size and proportions of the birds seen in flight in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crow figurine in Image B appears stable on the box's top edge, suggesting a reasonable balance in line with gravitational logic. The size is notably larger compared to the birds shown in flight on the packaging illustration, indicating a lack of direct proportional matching with the package illustration birds.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the packaging surrounding the scarecrow have clean edges, consistent material shading, and proper shadow alignment with the light source, indicating a solid, three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B indicates a well-designed packaging box with clean edges and consistent shading. The shadows cast align with the light source from the LED string lights, enhancing the three-dimensional effect and reinforcing the box's structural solidity. It appears realistic and three-dimensional.",
