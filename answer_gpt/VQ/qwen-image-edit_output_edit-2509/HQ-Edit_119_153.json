      "question": "Does the crystal cloche have smooth, continuous curvature with natural light refraction and no visible seams or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cloche covering the birdhouse exhibits smooth curves and the light reflects naturally across its surface, indicating a continuous curvature. There are no visible seams or jagged edges, which suggests polished craftsmanship and the use of a high-quality material typical of a well-made glass dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sapphire-colored shingles uniformly textured and do the gold details follow the roofâ€™s architectural contours without appearing artificially painted or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shingles on the roof in Image B have a consistent sapphire color and texture, which indicates a uniform application across the surface. The gold details align well with the architectural features and contours of the roof, showing no signs of detachment or artificial appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flower beds at the entrance have natural plant textures, correct scale relative to the birdhouse, and sit flush with the ground surface without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flower beds at the entrance exhibit textures that resemble real plants, maintaining a realistic scale in relation to the birdhouse. The flowers are integrated into the scene without appearing to float or clip through the ground, indicating attention to detail in their positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the woodland creatures visible only through the window openings, positioned behind glass, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict woodland creatures visible through the window openings or behind glass. Therefore, this question does not apply as described; there are no creatures to observe features such as shadows or positioning.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the grassy mound have natural undulations, consistent grass coverage, and a seamless transition to the birdhouse base without gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy mound in Image B shows natural undulations, mimicking the appearance of a real grass surface. The coverage is consistent, and it transitions seamlessly into the base of the birdhouse without any noticeable gaps or sections that appear to float, resulting in a cohesive integration into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all added elements (cloche, flowers, creatures, mound) respond to light consistently with the same direction and intensity as the original birdhouse and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, elements including the cloche, flowers, and grassy mound respond to the ambient light in a manner consistent with the birdhouse and the background. However, as there are no woodland creatures present in the image, it confirms that this element does not apply here. The light and shadow directions are consistent across visible elements, supporting a coherent lighting environment.",
