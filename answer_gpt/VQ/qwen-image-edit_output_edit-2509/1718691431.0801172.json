      "question": "Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox mask is examined for symmetry and proportional alignment of facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. From the visual information, the mask appears uniform, with both eyes positioned at equal distances from the center. The nose and mouth parts, although abstract in a mask, do not appear stretched or deformed. This symmetry indicates a careful design typical of aesthetically pleasing masks.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono replaced with clean, geometric motifs that follow consistent lines and shapes, without blurred or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's kimono is analyzed for the presence of clean and geometric motifs replacing the floral patterns. The motifs display consistent lines and shapes, clearly defining them against the fabric without blurring or fragmentation. This precision suggests deliberate design alterations to enhance the geometric theme of the edited image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is analyzed for its color transitions on the kimono and mask, which display a smooth and seamless blend between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones. There are no visible color bleeds or disruptions in shading, demonstrating skillful color grading commonly used to maintain visual harmony in edited images.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drape and fold of the kimono in Image B are closely examined for any unnatural alterations. The fabric maintains a realistic and natural structure, showcasing gentle folds and drapes typical of traditional kimonos. This reflects accurate preservation of physical properties despite potential digital modifications.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the surfaces of both the fox mask and kimono are smooth and coherent, without any jagged edges or pixelation. The absence of texture seams or rendering errors indicates a high level of refinement, suggesting meticulous attention to detail in the editing process.",
