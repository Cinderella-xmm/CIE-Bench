    "Question": "Q1: Does the characterâ€™s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the cartoon style, the character's face retains natural proportions and smooth contours. This is typically managed by ensuring features such as the nose, mouth, and general facial outline are kept balanced and proportionate, avoiding common pitfalls like exaggerated or minimized parts which often appear in purely cartoon depictions. Given the half-cartoon depiction, proportions appear to be adjusted to maintain a natural and balanced look.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is depicted with a shape that is consistent with a real book. The pages are uniformly thick and the edges are aligned, maintaining a realistic geometry without distortion. This suggests careful attention to its representation, ensuring it remains plausible and recognizable despite the transformation into a cartoon style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves have a consistent drape with folds that align with the natural behavior of fabric under gravity. The lighting and shadow depth also appear consistent with these folds, maintaining a realistic representation of how light interacts with textile surfaces. This indicates a good understanding and application of textile behavior in the illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden filigree details on the buttons are rendered clearly, with no visible artifacts like jagged edges or mismatched reflections. The integration with the surface of the button appears seamless, indicating careful crafting in the details that aligns with realistic depiction in a stylized manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the library shelves are transformed into a background that resembles a wooden frame. The wood grain is consistent across the surface, and the edges are aligned properly, providing depth cues that maintain spatial logic. There are no visual signs of broken geometry, indicating a thoughtful and coherent transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
