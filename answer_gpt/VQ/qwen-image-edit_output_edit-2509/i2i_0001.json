      "question": "Does the keychain appear to be naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain features smooth and consistent coloring throughout, characteristic of a high-quality soft rubber material. This continuity suggests it is naturally integrated. Additionally, there are no visible anomalies, such as mismatched outlines or color bleeding, ensuring that the texture and visual integration appear normal.",

      "question": "Are the keychain's features consistent with the chibi-style representation of the subject, preserving structural coherence and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi designs typically emphasize exaggerated, cute proportions with a simplified form. The keychain has a rounded, simplified form with large eyes and a small stature, which are characteristic traits of the chibi style. These features maintain visual coherence and adhere to the stylistic expectations of a chibi figure.",

      "question": "Does the keychain maintain essential details that make the subject recognizable, avoiding distortions such as broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Essential identifying elements such as the blue headscarf, golden hanging fabric, and green clothing are prominently featured in the keychain design. These elements ensure that the subject remains recognizable, even in a stylized format, indicating that there are no distortions or broken geometric shapes.",

      "question": "Are the materials of the keychain, specifically the soft rubber texture and bold black outlines, accurately represented without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain shows a smooth and matte surface indicative of soft rubber, with bold black outlines delineating each part of the character, typical of keychain styles. The texture is consistent with expectations for rubber, and there are no signs of unnatural textures such as glossiness or inappropriate shading.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver keyring is appropriately sized for the keychain, neither overwhelming it nor appearing disproportionately small. The keyringâ€™s attachment is practical and maintains visual plausibility, fitting well within the expected proportions of a typical keychain accessory.",
