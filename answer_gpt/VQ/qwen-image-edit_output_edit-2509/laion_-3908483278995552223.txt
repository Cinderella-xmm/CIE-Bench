    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "The 3D model of the Aquatic warrior exhibits well-proportioned limbs and body structure. The armor fits naturally, and there are no visible distortions or exaggerated features. The visual cues suggest a realistic and anatomically correct representation based on common depictions of warriors in similar armor.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
    "explanation": "The metallic blue surfaces of the armor demonstrate natural light reflections, providing depth and a realistic appearance. The varied lighting and shadow effects contribute to avoiding a flat or uniform coloring, enhancing the armor's visual appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
    "explanation": "The trident is correctly positioned in the warrior's hand, with the appropriate scale relative to the figure. It shows a natural angle without bending or truncation, consistent with typical depictions of similar weapons held by characters in a confident stance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
    "explanation": "The dome enclosing the model exhibits smooth curvature and consistent transparency. There are no visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies, which suggests a high-quality rendering typical of well-designed enclosures for display models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
    "explanation": "The coral reef base is textured with natural-looking organic patterns and is scaled appropriately. It supports the model proportionately, without appearing undersized or oversized, fitting well with the theme and ensuring realistic underwater ambiance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "The swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths. They exhibit smooth movement without abrupt breaks or floating fragments, enhancing the dynamic water element and its seamless integration with the aquatic theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "The hand holding the trident has five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure. There are no extra digits or unnatural bends, which aligns with realistic hand anatomy for holding objects securely and comfortably.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "All elements including the model, dome, base, and currents are spatially aligned and layered accurately. They exhibit a cohesive and integrated display without any floating or disconnected parts, maintaining a seamless presentation typical of high-quality 3D models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
