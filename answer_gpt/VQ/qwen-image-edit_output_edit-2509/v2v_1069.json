      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition from the ceiling fan to the snow globe maintain structural coherence without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling fan is encased within a snow globe. The structure is coherent, with the fan centrally placed and surrounded by small snowflakes. The textures look natural as the fan retains its metallic sheen, and the globe's surface is smooth and free from any visible distortions or unnatural textures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the fan preserved within the snow globe's interior, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan inside the snow globe retains its fine details, such as the metallic texture and the design of the blades. The details appear sharp and clear, which suggests that there is no loss of detail or presence of unnatural textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the exterior setting with soft lighting and a warm background complement the snow globe scene naturally, enhancing the overall realism and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soft lighting in Image B creates a warm, inviting atmosphere. The background is softly focused, drawing attention to the snow globe. The lighting complements the scene by casting gentle shadows and highlights, enhancing the realism and cohesive appearance of the snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the snow globe and its contents physically plausible, with no distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The size of the fan relative to the snow globe in Image B appears proportionally sound. The snow globe has a rounded, regular shape, and the fan fits well inside without appearing cramped or distorted. Geometric shapes are intact, suggesting plausibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the light passing through the snow globe create delicate shimmering effects on nearby surfaces that appear authentic and do not disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light interacts with the snow globe to produce subtle shimmering effects. These effects are consistent with how light refracts through glass and interacts with the snowflakes, enhancing authenticity without disrupting the scene's authenticity.",
