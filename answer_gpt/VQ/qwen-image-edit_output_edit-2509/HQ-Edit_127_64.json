    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited stylized seating icons are positioned above silhouettes of people sitting. From the visual depiction, these icons appear isolated and do not overlap actual entities depicted in the image, such as individuals. Given the stylized nature of the icons in Image B, shadows or consistent interaction with the sun's illumination are not implied due to the illustrative format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble graphics in Image B are designed to symbolize conversation rather than physically interacting with any human forms or clothing present in the stylized setting. They are appropriately sized, giving prominence to the idea of exchange without obstructing any walking silhouettes, which are uniformly depicted.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The camera icon in Image B is located alongside a silhouette suggesting the Eiffel Tower, scaled to complement the representative graphic form without introducing distortions or edge artifacts. The simplified nature of the icon achieves a conceptual representation rather than literal accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical split line divides the infographic layout rather than the realistic scene portrayed in Image A. It is centered within the illustrative content's framework and does not intersect or disrupt strategic visuals like the Eiffel Tower or any hedges within its creative context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cool green tones in Image B are uniformly applied as part of the stylistic theme of the infographic, focusing on a simplified, illustrative aesthetic. The tonal application does not aim for realism as in Image A, avoiding detailed depiction of natural scenes. The design choice accommodates graphical consistency without explicit artifacts like color banding.",
