      "question": "Are the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs free from unnatural textures and maintain detailed edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes are made of a crystal-like material that appears faceted and reflects light in multiple directions, which is characteristic of crystals. The edges of these crystal silhouettes are well-defined, following a geometric pattern commonly seen in crystal structures. Therefore, while the texture is not 'natural' in the organic sense, it is consistent with the property of crystalline materials, which supports the idea of detailed edges free from unnatural textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs integrate naturally with the background and the bench, without creating visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the couple as crystal silhouettes seated on a bench. The integration appears seamless as the silhouettes are appropriately seated on the bench, and there are no visible breaks between the silhouettes and the bench or immediate background. The sunlight effects on the crystal further enhance their natural integration by coherently aligning with the ambient lighting. This suggests that the integration is visually intact without breaks.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs realistic and consistent with human anatomy, avoiding exaggerated or distorted forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the crystal silhouettes maintain proportions that align with typical human forms in terms of posture and size, resembling the seated couple in a natural manner similar to Image A. The structural outline aligns with realistic body proportions, with no parts appearing exaggerated or distorted, ensuring consistency with human anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the crystal material used for the silhouettes of the couple's backs appear three-dimensional and transparent, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal material in Image B is depicted with facets that reflect and refract light, offering a clear three-dimensional aspect. This translucency allows background elements to be partially visible through, or reflected upon, the crystal, adding to the natural realism and depth characteristic of transparent materials, enhancing the overall natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs still convey the impression that the couple is seated naturally on the bench, maintaining spatial coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the couple's crystal silhouettes in a seated position on the bench similar to the original Image A, maintaining spatial coherence. The shadows and light interact with the crystal material in a realistic manner that maintains the impression of them being seated naturally, consistent with the lighting and perspective of the bench.",
