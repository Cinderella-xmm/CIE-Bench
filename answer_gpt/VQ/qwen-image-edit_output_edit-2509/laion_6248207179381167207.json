      "question": "Are the silver and turquoise geometric patterns evenly distributed across the handbag's surface without visible misalignment, stretching, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the silver and turquoise geometric patterns appear to be well-distributed across the handbag's surface. The patterns are consistent and uniform, with clear and well-defined shapes that do not show any misalignment or stretching. The vividness of the turquoise color and the precision in the silver accents contribute to a high-quality visual impression without pixelation. Comparing this with Image A, which features a traditional Louis Vuitton monogram pattern, the edited pattern maintains high standards in distribution and precision.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic accents on the leather straps appear seamlessly integrated, with no sharp edges, inconsistent shading, or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows metallic accents on the leather straps that appear to be smoothly integrated into the design. These accents do not have sharp edges or inconsistent shading that would suggest poor editing. The highlights and reflections on the metal elements are consistent and realistic, enhancing the overall cohesion of the design. World knowledge informs us that seamless integration is necessary for maintaining the luxury aesthetic of high-quality handbags. Comparing this with Image A’s traditional buckle design, the edited image achieves a coherent fusion of metal and leather.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the machine-age engravings along the edges of the handbag continuous, properly aligned with the contours, and free from broken lines or overlapping patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the machine-age engravings along the edges are continuous and appear to follow the handbag’s contours precisely. There are no broken lines or overlapping patterns, which suggests a careful attention to detail in the editing process. These engravings complement the art deco style seen across the handbag, reinforcing the historical design theme. If compared to Image A, which lacks such elaborate engravings, Image B demonstrates high-quality continuity and alignment.",

      "question": "Are the front pockets and zippered closure still clearly defined and structurally coherent, with no distortion in their shape or placement relative to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the front pockets and zippered closure remain clearly defined and structurally sound. Their placement and proportions are preserved without distortion, allowing them to retain their functionality and aesthetic coherence. This assessment is based on visual cues that show crisp lines and proper alignment. Comparatively, Image A, serves as the structural template, confirming that Image B maintains the essential aspects of handbag design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the transformed surfaces exhibit realistic material properties, such as subtle texture variation and appropriate light reflection, without appearing flat or digitally over-rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays transformed surfaces that exhibit realistic material properties. There is subtle texture variation that suggests depth, and the light reflection behavior is consistent with high-quality leather, contributing to a lifelike appearance rather than a digitally over-rendered one. World knowledge of luxury materials supports the observation that rich texture and natural reflections are essential qualities. Comparing this to Image A’s texture, Image B maintains these realistic characteristics effectively.",
