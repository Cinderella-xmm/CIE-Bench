      "question": "Does the book animation on the clock face align perfectly with the curved top and vertical frame of the clock, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is placed on the clock face which is visually challenging to confirm an alignment due to expected refraction and shadow effects from the glass of the clock. The curved top of the clock should seamlessly accommodate the circular base of the book, and the book's geometry should blend with the vertical frame of the clock seamlessly to maintain its proportions. However, based on the rendering of light and material transitions depicted, the book does not seamlessly align with what would have been the natural frame and materials of a clock, suggesting some mismatch in integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the text snippets embedded in the wallpaper clearly legible, evenly spaced, and seamlessly blended into the background pattern without creating unnatural shadows or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text snippets are placed on the wallpaper which features an ornate pattern. For the snippets to be seamlessly integrated, they need to visually appear as if they were part of the original wallpaper design. However, the text is not perfectly legible with signs of asymmetry and irregular shadowing that do not correspond with a natural look, indicative of superimposed text that affects readability and results in a non-seamless blend into the background.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image of the ancient sundial inside the framed artwork properly scaled, centered, and rendered with consistent lighting and depth relative to the original frame and surrounding wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an ancient sundial has been placed inside the framed artwork. To appear consistent, it should be proportionate to fit the frame adequately, centered, and exhibit uniform lighting and depth as with other elements in the room. Here, the sundial is rendered with some discrepancies concerning lighting which seems off compared to surrounding elements, possibly due to the effects not matching what a fixed painting would naturally exhibit in this setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the pen-shaped clock hands appear structurally sound, properly aligned with the book’s cover, and free from distortion such as bent metal parts or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands have been altered to pen shapes that should physically align with the dial and book cover, maintaining structural integrity. Observing Image B, the pen shapes are positioned adequately, but lack natural connection and dynamic integrity often observed in clock hands, with minor distortion visible against the book cover potentially stemming from insufficient shadowing or alignment with the book's closing edge.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the captions placed in the room clearly readable, stylistically consistent with art-nouveau design, and physically integrated into their respective surfaces without overlapping or distorting underlying materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, captions are overlaid throughout the room which should blend with the decor in an art-nouveau style. They should exhibit styling in line with the room’s thematic essence and be readable without disrupting or modifying surface textures unduly. The text shows art-nouveau elements but is not consistently clear due to the stylized font and ineffective integration onto various surfaces as seen through potential overlap or significant deviation in text readability.",
