      "question": "Do the enlarged and shiny mango pieces retain their natural texture and shape without appearing distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mango pieces in Image B have been transformed into a cartoonish style, which inherently holds a different texture compared to a natural mango in Image A. While they are shiny and have defined edges, they are stylized in a way that does not mimic natural mango texture. The question of unnatural appearance depends on the context of natural versus stylized cartoon elements. Given this context, the mango pieces do appear distorted in texture as expected from this cartoon style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cartoon-like design of the lime and chili powder bowl appear visually credible and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime and chili powder bowl are depicted with cartoon-like faces with exaggerated features which is consistent with the whimsical design intended in this edit. There don't appear to be any visual artifacts such as misaligned textures or awkward lighting that would make them appear unnatural within their cartoon context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the edited elements, including the whimsical mango figurine, lime, and chili powder bowl, visually credible and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B follows a consistent whimsical theme, with each element maintaining its structural design fitting within the intended cartoon-like representation. The layout is organized, and there appears to be a coherent visual theme linking all objects - including their positioning and interactions - suggesting an internally credible design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the shiny 3D effect on the mango pieces enhance the visual appeal without degrading fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D effect on the mango pieces in Image B is polished and shiny, enhancing their visual appeal in a cartoon context but deliberately lacks fine natural mango textures for a stylistic purpose. The texture introduced is intended as part of the stylized representation, and within that framework, it doesn't degrade but shifts the expected appearance to fit the cartoon theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the whimsical mango figurine retain its structural integrity and natural appearance, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango figurine is crafted to match a whimsical and playful style characterized by rounded shapes and expressive features. Within this cartoon design, the geometric shapes are intact and smoothly rendered, free from distortion or unexpected breaks, consistent with character designs in cartoons.",
