      "question": "Are the color blocks applied across the shirtâ€™s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon-colored patterns on the shirt appear vibrant and eye-catching. The colors are distinct from one another, with boundaries that are sharply defined, suggesting deliberate color blocking. There is no evidence of smudging, blending, or fading between the adjacent color blocks, which helps to maintain a clean, graphic appearance. This deliberate approach to color application is commonly seen in designs aiming for a high-impact, pop-art-like aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the shirt are complex and vibrant. They do not appear to repeat in a uniform manner, as each section is filled with unique neon designs that transform the original design into a more dynamic iteration. This approach suggests an intentional divergence from pattern repetition to embrace a more artistic and varied interpretation, which is common in art styles that aim for creativity rather than repetition. Analyzing Image A, the original pattern appears more cohesive and uniform, while Image B exhibits intentional artistic chaos that disregards symmetry and alignment consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, from what can be discerned beyond the blurred face, the overall structure of the figure's limbs and torso remains faithful to physical realism. The limbs and torso of the central figure maintain appropriate proportions, and the joint lines do not appear exaggerated or broken. This suggests that the modified design retained its anatomical accuracy, which is crucial for intricate and vivid designs meant to uphold a sense of realism even amidst a vibrant color palette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ignoring the blurred face, the ornamental details, including the central figure's hair texture and surrounding lines, in Image B appear bright and vivid with various neon colors. However, due to the vibrant overload and blending of colors, the finer details seem somewhat obscured when compared to typical standards for clear visibility. This is common in heavily stylized art where vivid colors may overwhelm finer details, but comparing it to Image A reveals a discernible difference in clarity and definition of such elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure seems to be well-positioned within the circular frame of the design, maintaining the intended focus and flow of the original design. The bordering geometric shapes, while colored differently, do not display apparent distortion or signs of misalignment. Despite the energetic color changes, the overall structure retains its integrity and appears consistent with the original layout shown in Image A where alignment was accurate.",
