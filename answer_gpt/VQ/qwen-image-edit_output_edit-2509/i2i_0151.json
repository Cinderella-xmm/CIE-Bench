      "question": "Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite appears to have a distinct geometric shape with clearly defined edges and vertices, consistent with a well-made kite. There are no visible signs of distortion or damage to its shape. The imagery gives the perception of a perfect kite model by combining the sharp contrasting lines and corners visible in the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B has a smooth surface with no unusual patterns or textures that would detract from the normal texture expected of paper material. The color consistency and lack of distortive textures suggest the material is aptly represented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow color of the kite appears bright and consistent throughout. Its shade is harmonious with the sky, without any sudden changes or irregularities in color tone, suggesting it has been integrated naturally into the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite's tail in Image B looks consistently attached to the base of the kite, and its flow is smooth. There are no visible breaks, indicating continuity and a coherent connection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The string attached to the kite displays a consistent, natural thinness, without any conspicuous artifacts or variations in thickness, which aligns with the typical appearance of a kite string.",
