      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned and proportionally consistent with each other, without any visible stretching or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred, so we cannot determine the alignment and proportionality of the facial features. Therefore, the question about the alignment and proportion of visible facial features cannot be conclusively answered.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted as voluminous and fluffy with strands that appear to flow naturally. The hair seems full and consistent, without flat patches or obvious artificial layering. This observation aligns with the typical portrayal of fluffy hair on plush figures or dolls.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black vertical stripes on the sweater are rendered as continuous lines that appear evenly spaced, mimicking stitched detailing. There are no visible jagged edges or gaps, suggesting a uniform and clean design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions between the hair and the sweater appear smooth and consistent. The integration between different textures (hair to sweater fabric) is seamless, without any visible mismatches or harsh seams, which contributes to a more cohesive visual presentation.",
