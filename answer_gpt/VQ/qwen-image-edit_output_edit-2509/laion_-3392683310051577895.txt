    "Question": "Q1: Do the curled horn-like structures on both armrests have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
    "explanation": "The horn-like structures on the armrests appear to have a smooth, continuous curvature that visually resembles real horns with a natural and even thickness. In terms of design, these structures simulate the organic shape of horns that would typically not have jagged edges or abrupt changes in thickness.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the bark-textured scales on the backrest evenly distributed, with natural variations in shape and depth, and do they follow the original contour of the sofa without tearing or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The bark-textured scales on the backrest seem to be designed to mimic natural bark patterns, with variation in shape and depth that gives them a realistic appearance. These scales are aligned with the backrest of the sofa, maintaining the original contour and exhibiting no visible tearing or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the mossy, leafy mane extend continuously from the top of the cushions, showing layered depth and natural variation in green tones, without sharp seams or floating leaves?",
    "explanation": "The leafy mane extends from the top of the cushions and appears to exhibit a natural, layered depth with varying green tones. In the edited image, there are no sharp seams visible, and the leaves do not appear to be floating unrealistically. The effect is that of a continuous, naturally integrated design element.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the emerald eyes positioned centrally above the middle cushion, emitting a soft, diffused glow that casts subtle shadows on the surrounding leather without harsh outlines or overexposure?",
    "explanation": "The emerald eyes are positioned centrally above the middle cushion. They emit a glow that appears to be soft and diffused, casting subtle shadows onto the leather. The glow does not have any harsh outlines or signs of overexposure, indicating a well-rendered lighting effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the wooden limbs extend from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet, with vines wrapped around clawed ends that appear structurally sound and proportionate to the sofa's size?",
    "explanation": "The wooden limbs extend from underneath the sofa, appearing to reach the carpet surface naturally. The design includes vines wrapped around the clawed ends, contributing to the organic appearance. These elements appear proportionate to the overall size of the sofa, suggesting a carefully considered structural integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there faint, localized glows or energy effects near the limbs or eyes that blend into the environment without creating visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural color bleeding?",
    "explanation": "Upon examination, there are no evident pixelation artifacts or unnatural color bleeding around the limbs or eyes that would distract from the overall design. The faint glows and energy effects blend effectively with the environment, indicating smooth integration without digital artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
