    "Question": "Q1: Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floating island has clean, continuous edges which make the field appear well-integrated with the surrounding environment. There are no distortions or broken geometric shapes that impede this visual impression. The surreal imagery of a floating island complements the starry background smoothly, which is a common portrayal in surreal art where the entire field can float in space.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are portrayed in vibrant colors that stand out. The detailing and coloring are consistent and free from texture artifacts or color fringing, as is typical in high-quality digital artwork. This results in a natural yet vibrant appearance, aligning with surreal art that maintains clear boundaries and vivid colors without visual disturbances.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the apple is depicted as a large, realistically shaded object with a texture that gives it a lifelike quality despite its surreal context. The lighting on the apple is consistent, which enhances its three-dimensional appearance. The surreal nature allows the object to be much larger than surrounding elements and still make sense visually, resembling a real fruit rather than a graphic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the insects are stylized as part of the surreal scene but retain identifiable features such as wings and body shapes. Their contours are smooth, and they are drawn without anatomical deformities or fragmentation, fitting the surreal style while remaining recognizable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a traditional tree, there is a hollow geometric form with clean lines. This shape integrates well into the surreal theme, maintaining a sense of structural integrity even though it is unconventional. The internal voids do not cause fragmentation or create a sense of physical impossibility within the surreality context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
