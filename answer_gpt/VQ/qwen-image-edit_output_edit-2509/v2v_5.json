      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes on the chibi character appear consistent with the original pattern without unnatural distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi zebra's stripes are displayed with coherent and consistent patterns similar to those found on real zebras. The stripes appear correctly proportioned with smooth transitions between the black and white areas. Using common knowledge, zebra stripes form distinctive patterns that are naturally complimentary and aligned with the contour of their bodies. The examination of these patterns in the chibi character indicates a consistent portrayal without noticeable distortion or pixelation, maintaining the natural aesthetic of zebra stripes.",

      "question": "Does the chibi zebra's interaction with the miniature cake appear natural and free from any obvious artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi zebra is depicted as holding or being near a miniature cake that resembles the larger cake in Image A. The proximity of the zebra to the cake looks naturally presented and coherent with the relational size and positions expected in such scenes. There are no visible artifacts or distortions that affect the natural movement or expected interaction between the zebra and the cake. The scene effectively conveys a coherent interaction between the zebra and the cake.",

      "question": "Is the chibi zebra seated on the edge of the Instagram frame in a way that appears structurally coherent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi zebra is positioned interacting with an Instagram frame. It appears to sit or rest on the frame's edge in a visually coherent manner. The compositional structure supports the scene’s credibility, with the zebra’s positioning aligning accurately with the frame's plane. Using common understanding of 2D and 3D visual perception, the positioning seems logically feasible without causing visual dissonance or structural errors in the scene.",

      "question": "Does the inclusion of the username \"ZebraLover\" and social media icons blend seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes social media elements, such as the username 'ZebraLover' and various icons typical of social media interfaces like Instagram. These elements are integrated into the design of the frame in a complementary manner, without any alignment issues or visual disruptions. The overall composition appears unified, with the elements cohesively included in a way that matches typical social media design paradigms. Based on common graphic design principles, these elements do not disrupt the visual flow or natural appearance of the entire image.",

      "question": "Are the materials used for the chibi zebra and the cake natural in appearance, without any obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rendering of the chibi zebra and the miniature cake appears in a stylized manner typical of digital graphics. The visual textures are smooth and consistent with a digitally rendered aesthetic. The materials, while not entirely mimicking natural textures due to their stylized representation, do not exhibit any unusual or unnatural anomalies that would detract from the overall visual quality. Common knowledge of digital rendering highlights that materials often feature smooth, uniform textures for aesthetics, which align with what is seen here.",
