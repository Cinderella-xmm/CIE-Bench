    "Question": "Q1: Does the flying disc look natural in size and shape compared to the original tennis ball, maintaining a realistic appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a blue flying disc in the space where the tennis ball was in Image A.

Its round shape is consistent with typical flying discs. Comparing this with Image A, the flying disc is indeed larger, and the size appears consistent with its actual size during play, showing an appropriate proportion relative to the dog and maintaining a realistic appearance.",
