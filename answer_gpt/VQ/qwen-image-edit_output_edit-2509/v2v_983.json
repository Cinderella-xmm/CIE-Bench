      "question": "Does the creature maintain the dog's original body proportions and structure without any unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is depicted in a chibi, cartoonish style, which often involves exaggeration and simplification of certain features, such as larger eyes and smaller bodies, compared to the realistic proportions seen in Image A. The ears in Image B are notably larger and more pointed than in a typical real-life dog, while the body has been stylized and streamlined to fit the fantasy aesthetic, making the proportions deviate from those of the real dog in Image A. This indicates that the creature does not maintain the original dog's body proportions and structure in a realistic sense.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the dog's fur accurately represented in the fantasy creature without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's depiction is in a cartoon style, which often lacks detailed texturing, such as individual fur strands, which are visible in Image A. Instead, the creature shows smooth and solid color areas typical of illustrated artwork, rather than detailed fur texture. This artistic choice means that the fine details and texture of the dog's fur are not represented as they are in the original image.",

      "question": "Does the custom orb or capsule near the creature's feet appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the custom orb or capsule is artistically integrated into the scene in a manner consistent with the fantasy theme. The orb matches the color palette and style of the entire artwork, making it look naturally integrated. The surrounding elements such as the creature's color and the pastoral background do not appear disrupted, creating a visually coherent scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the creature's posture and stance remain consistent with the dog's original posture, ensuring structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both Image A and Image B show a similar posture where the animal is lying down, with forelegs stretched in front and hind legs tucked underneath. This shows that despite the artistic changes in style and size, the creature's stance remains anatomically comparable to that of the real dog in Image A. Thus, the structural coherence concerning posture has been maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the creature's name and elemental type text clearly legible and does not introduce any visual clutter or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is designed to match the fantasy theme with a stylized font while remaining distinct enough to be legible. There is no apparent visual clutter caused by the text, and it is placed in a way that does not interfere with the main subject, ensuring the text is integrated without artifacts.",
