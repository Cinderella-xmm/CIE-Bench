      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dark velvet robe show realistic fabric folds and light reflection consistent with thick, heavy material, and do the golden embroidery patterns follow natural thread-like textures without pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet robe depicted in Image B shows fabric folds that are consistent with the behavior of heavy material, displaying areas of smoother surface where light reflection is visible. World knowledge about fabric types suggests that velvet typically reflects light softly and shows defined folds, which is present here. The golden embroidery patterns exhibit detailed thread-like textures without pixelation or jagged edges, indicating a high level of detail and precision that aligns with how embroidery is generally viewed in reality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wooden shelves aligned with the original bookcase structure in terms of depth and angle, and do the books display consistent spine thickness, aging effects, and shadows that match the overall lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shelves are presented with elements that suggest proper alignment with the original bookcase structure. Observations on the visual cue of depth and angle support this setup. The arrangement of books shows consistent spine thickness that corresponds to common book shelving practices. The perceived aging effects and shadowing align with expected lighting conditions from a dim, candle-lit environment, providing coherence in visual elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the fingers wrap naturally around the quill and parchment without extra digits, unnatural bending, or gaps between skin and object, and is the parchment folded in a way that matches real paper flexibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual observation of the hand placement around the quill and parchment in Image B indicates a natural gripping posture, showing adequate finger count and natural bending similar to how one would hold writing tools. There is no apparent unnatural bending or gaps between skin and the objects. The parchment exhibits folding characteristics consistent with how real paper would behaveâ€”a reflection of flexibility in its form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the inkstand positioned flush with the armrest surface, casting a soft shadow consistent with the light source, and does it have reflective metallic properties that match the surrounding environment without appearing flat or artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inkstand in Image B is positioned correctly, resting flush with the armrest surface. It casts a soft shadow that aligns with the nearby light source, providing depth perception. Observed reflective metallic properties of the inkstand correspond with typical material properties, ensuring congruence with the environment and avoiding flat or artificial appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the warm light source create soft gradients on the face, highlight the golden embroidery, and produce gentle shadows beneath the chin and arms, with no abrupt transitions or mismatched brightness levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ignoring the face, the warm light source in Image B generates soft gradients that interact naturally with the clothing and environment. The light effectively highlights the golden embroidery on the robe with additional emphasis, a known behavior of highlighting in such light conditions. Shadows beneath the chin and arms suggest smooth transitions and consistent brightness levels without abrupt changes, contributing to a realistic depiction of a dimly lit setting.",
