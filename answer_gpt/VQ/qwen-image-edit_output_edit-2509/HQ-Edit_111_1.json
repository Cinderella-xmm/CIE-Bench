      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated muscles on the athlete’s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete's muscular structure appears highly exaggerated and stylized, which is typical for cartoon or comic art. While this style intentionally extends beyond natural human anatomy for dramatic effect, it maintains a sense of fluidity and consistent anatomical contour lines even though they are exaggerated. This adheres to a style that is consistent with comic book art, where muscles are often shown in heightened states of engagement or tension, thus following certain anatomical patterns albeit exaggerated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fiery red gloves with gold accents visually consistent in material texture and color, with no visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves are represented with bold colors and sharp lines synonymous with comic art styling. They show a consistent texture with clear, distinct colors and highlights. The color scheme includes bright reds and gold accents which are uniformly applied across the gloves, making them harmonious without visible issues such as pixelation. The consistent color tones and absence of visual glitches indicate a careful handling of the object's presentation within a comic art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the strobe lights in the background evenly distributed and consistent in direction and intensity, without creating unnatural shadows or light leaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses bright, linear strobe lights that are symmetrically arranged in a pattern behind the central figure. There is consistent intensity and direction, contributing to a dynamic backdrop that enhances the athlete’s figure without causing distracting shadows or light leaks. The lighting complements the dramatic and intense atmosphere typical of high-energy comic scenes and does so without distorting other visual elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank motivational quote panel aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it have consistent lighting and shadowing to appear as if part of the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motivational quote panel appears to stand out from the rest of the scene due to its alignment and interaction with the environment's lighting. While the panel is legible and positioned to catch the viewer's eye, it does appear slightly misaligned from the typical perspective of the scene and lacks consistent shadowing that matches the environment’s luminous aspects. This causes it to appear as a distinct overlay rather than seamlessly integrated with the other elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition balanced and framed appropriately so that the central figure and key elements (gloves, stance, lighting) remain clear and undistorted when scaled for print?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition centers the athlete as the focal point with distinct features like gloves and a confident stance presenting prominently. The elements are well-positioned with each frame sustaining clarity and proportionality, ensuring the artwork maintains integrity when scaled. The framing effectively captures the disposition and action of the scene, vital for print replication where detail consistency is paramount.",
