      "question": "Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterned textile on the character’s top displays intricate geometric designs, which appear coherent and well-integrated. The color gradients are consistent, with clear and natural transitions between colors, respecting typical fabric textures found in textiles from various cultural fabrics, especially those with vibrant patterns. The absence of visible distortions, such as pixelation or artifact repetition, suggests a high-quality rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces clearly defined, proportionally accurate, and free from distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jewelry appears to feature tribal motifs that are precisely defined and symmetrical, consistent with traditional craftsmanship that seeks detail and accuracy. The edges of the earrings and necklaces appear smooth without distortion, and the reflections and highlights on the surface are natural, mirroring what is typical of polished jewelry surfaces under ambient light, indicating a well-rendered piece.",

      "question": "Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the umbrellas in the background maintain a realistic proportion and spatial arrangement, which complements the bustling market scene. They are positioned logically relative to the market stalls, avoiding overlap that would indicate an error in layering or perspective. Their placement suggests an understanding of depth and scale commonly found in such crowded scenes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the musical notes distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories around the character’s head, without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs in their paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the musical notes are evenly distributed and appear to follow flowing trajectories surrounding the character in a manner that suggests movement or musical rhythm. Their arrangement lacks any abrupt breaks or cutoff paths, creating a cohesive visual element that adheres to the artistic representation of music.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character’s right hand show five fingers with correct proportions, natural curvature, and realistic skin texture, without any missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s right hand is illustrated with five fingers that are proportionate and naturally curved, resembling realistic human anatomy. The skin texture is consistent with an artistic depiction of realistic skin, appearing smooth and natural without any errors associated with digital editing such as duplicated or missing fingers.",
