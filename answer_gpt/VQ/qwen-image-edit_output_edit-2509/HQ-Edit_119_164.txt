    "Question": "Q1: Do the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head, without warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial sails that replace the elephant's ears appear to maintain a consistent size and are attached to the head in a manner that does not show any visible warping or unnatural stretching. The blending of the sails into the head visualizes a smooth transition, which suggests that the sails are a natural part of the elephant's anatomy in this surreal depiction. This consistency can be determined by looking at how the base of the sails aligns naturally with the head, creating a coherent visual without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk smoothly integrated into the scene without jagged edges, overlapping artifacts, or inconsistent opacity?",
    "explanation": "The cosmic mist in Image B is well-rendered, showing a smooth integration into the scene. There are no jagged edges or artifacts that suggest poor editing. The mist's opacity is consistent with a realistic look, and it seamlessly flows from the trunk into the air. The smoothness of the mist and the absence of any visible flaws suggest skilled blending into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the planetary rings around the elephant's legs evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes, without clipping into the leg surface or appearing misaligned due to perspective?",
    "explanation": "The planetary rings around the elephant's legs in Image B are depicted clearly and appear evenly spaced. They align well with the limb axes and do not exhibit any clipping into the leg surface. The alignment and perspective of the rings relative to the legs are accurate, indicating careful attention to detail in their placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it, with no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet seem to be well-embedded into the foot surface. There is no indication that they are floating above, and there is a complete absence of haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas. The stars meld naturally into the foot, which creates the illusion of them being a part of the texture rather than an overlay.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the galaxy-patterned skin follow the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution and avoiding abrupt transitions or stretched patterns?",
    "explanation": "The galaxy-patterned skin in Image B adheres closely to the natural folds and creases of the elephant's body. It maintains a consistent texture resolution that fits smoothly over the skin's topography, with no abrupt transitions or stretched patterns. This detailed artistic design respects the natural anatomy, ensuring the pattern follows the body's contours effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
