    "Question": "Q1: Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armor on the central figure appears to be symmetrically aligned and follows the natural lines of the human body. The sections on the torso and arms seem designed to follow typical human contours, such as shoulders, biceps, and chest, suggesting an intentional design to mimic real armor fits. Therefore, it seems that there are no distorted shapes or broken geometry present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the ocean-themed armor on the rightmost figure’s jacket smooth and continuous without visible tiling or unnatural blending?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the ocean-themed armor textures on the rightmost figure’s jacket appear to be continuous and smooth. There are no visible signs of texture repetition or unnatural blending which would indicate poor design or rendering. The texture flow seems to correspond with realistic armor properties without abrupt changes or inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the right hand of the rightmost figure have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and joint curvature, even with armor applied?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand of the rightmost figure is covered with armor, and analyzing the image, it appears there are five fingers with appropriate spacing. The curvature seems consistent with human anatomy, suggesting a natural representation even with the armor inclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the sky gradient from the horizon upward smooth and free of color banding or abrupt transitions between orange, blue, and purple hues?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the sky exhibits a gradient that transitions from orange near the horizon to blue and then purple hues upper skyward. The transitions between these colors are smooth, without visible banding or abrupt shifts that would disrupt the typical dawn/dusk depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the typography at the bottom of the image clearly legible, properly aligned, and textured with ocean-spray effects without repeating patterns or sharp edges?",
    "explanation": "The typography in Image B is bold and prominently displayed at the bottom. It is clear and legible with a consistent style that complements the ocean theme. There are no repeating patterns or improperly aligned edges that would make it difficult to read or visually unattractive. An ocean-spray effect is presumably incorporated, but it doesn't compromise clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the ocean creature motifs on the armor of the leftmost figure small, integrated, and positioned in a way that does not distort the armor’s form?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the leftmost figure's armor has intricate ocean creature motifs that are well-integrated into its design. These elements appear to be proportionately small and do not distort the overall structural form of the armor. The motifs enhance rather than detract from the armor’s overall appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do the shadows of the figures fall forward onto the rocks in alignment with the sun’s position behind them, and are the silhouettes sharp and unbroken?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures have shadows that project forward, which aligns logically with the sun's position near the horizon behind them. The silhouettes are sharp, consistent, and uninterrupted, maintaining optical accuracy for shadows cast in such a lighting setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
