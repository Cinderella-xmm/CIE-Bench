      "question": "Does the chibi-style depiction of the rider's beige shirt maintain its structural consistency and material appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style representation of the shirt simplifies the design while maintaining recognizable elements such as the collar and button-down style. The depiction does not show any irregularities or artifacts that disrupt the visual perception of the shirt.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited chibi image, the horse is depicted with deliberately exaggerated proportions typical of this art style. It features a larger head and smaller body but maintains clear characteristics of a horse, such as the shape of the body and face.
