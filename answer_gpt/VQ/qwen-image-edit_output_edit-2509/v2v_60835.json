      "question": "Do the brass pistons and gears replacing the cheetahs' leg joints appear structurally coherent and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetahs are depicted with mechanical features such as brass pistons and gears where their leg joints would be, giving them a steampunk appearance. Upon examining these elements, the pistons and gears are integrated proportionally and match the expected styling of a structurally sound device, consistent with steampunk design aesthetics, which often include detailed mechanical parts. The editing aligns with the visual and textual cues suggesting that this transformation is intentional and fits the theme, making them appear structurally coherent and free from unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Does the transition from spotted fur to tooled leather and copper plating look natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In applying a steampunk theme in Image B, the transition from the cheetahs' natural spotted fur to tooled leather and copper plating is a significant stylistic choice. This transition seems smooth, with the copper plating and leather seamlessly integrated into the animal's natural form and coloration. This indicates careful editing without evident artifacts, achieving a balanced synthesis between the organic and mechanical look.",

      "question": "Are the glowing amber lenses in place of the cheetahs' eyes integrated naturally without disrupting the visual credibility of their faces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing amber lenses serve as the cheetahs' eyes in Image B, adhering to the steampunk theme. These lenses are proportionally placed and integrated into facial features, maintaining coherence with the rest of the mechanical modifications without distorting the natural shape of the cheetahs' faces or disrupting visual credibility.",

      "question": "Do the fantastical clockwork structures and coppery clouds in the background integrate seamlessly with the savanna horizon without causing visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features imaginative clockwork structures typical of a steampunk setting, with coppery clouds filling the sky. Despite the fantastical elements, they blend seamlessly with the horizon, maintaining continuity with the surrounding savanna elements and avoiding any visual distortions. This integration is achieved by the consistent color palette and proportionate scale of elements.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the cheetahs and the environment been preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates detailed mechanical modifications but retains the fine details of the cheetahs such as their postures and spots, as well as the environmental nuances of the savanna. The consistent quality of texture across elements from brass to fur indicates careful attention to preserve these details without introducing unnatural textures or compromising the visual integrity of the scene.",
