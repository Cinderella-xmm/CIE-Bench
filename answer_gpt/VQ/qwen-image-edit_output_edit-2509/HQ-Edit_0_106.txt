    "Question": "Q1: Does the lion’s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lion's silhouette is prominently featured against a vibrant sunset background. The shape of the silhouette perfectly represents a lion with clearly defined features such as the mane, posture, and tail. These elements comply with common knowledge of a lion’s anatomy, demonstrating good proportions. The edges of the silhouette are smooth and do not show any pixelation or distortion. This suggests that the image was likely created with high-resolution graphics, maintaining clean lines throughout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop consists of a gradient transitioning from rich reds and oranges to darker shades at the top. The gradient appears smooth and continuous, without any abrupt shifts or lines that would suggest banding. This type of gradient is common in digital artwork where smooth transitions are used to create a realistic or visually pleasing effect. The smoothness in color transitions indicates a professional level of digital editing or illustration.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
    "explanation": "The grass in the foreground of Image B appears consistent in terms of lighting and matches the linear shadowing typically observed in similar sunset scenes. The grass maintains a natural look with coherent spatial depth that integrates well with the silhouetted environment. There is no evident repeating pattern or artificial sharpness that would detract from the scene's unity, which suggests a well-integrated design process for this element in the artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of the acacia trees exhibit a natural posture that corresponds with typical acacia trees, characterized by their flat-topped canopies and sparse branches. The silhouettes are complete and do not show broken branches or unnatural angles, maintaining structural integrity. They are also placed at intervals that lend balance to the composition, creating a visually harmonious landscape scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The title text in Image B is prominently displayed above the lion's silhouette and does not intrude upon the lion’s outline, maintaining a clear separation. The contrast between the text and the background ensures high legibility, and the text does not exhibit any visual noise or distortion. This careful placement and font choice show an intentional design decision to ensure readability and aesthetic appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
