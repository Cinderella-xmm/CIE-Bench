    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a glass bell jar around the robot. The surface of the jar is clear and smooth, without any distortions of the robot's structure inside. Reflections and refractions appear natural, as expected from a glass surface. The smoothness and clarity of the jar are consistent with standard glass properties, and its clarity does not interfere with observing the details of the robot.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the pedestal under the robot properly aligned, proportionally sized, and made of materials consistent with the steampunk theme (e.g., brass, copper) without visible seams or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal under the robot is well-aligned and proportionally sized to support the robot. It appears to be made from materials like brass or copper, consistent with steampunk aesthetics. There are no visible seams or deformation in the structure of the pedestal, which maintains its aesthetic integrity and functional role.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils positioned at a plausible scale and orientation around the robot, with natural textures and no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils are positioned in a manner that makes sense spatially around the robot. Their size and orientation are plausible in relation to the robot's structure. The textures appear natural, consistent with their material properties, and there are no floating or disconnected parts, indicating a coherent assembly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the glowing orbs emit a soft, localized glow that blends naturally with the ambient lighting and does not produce unnatural light artifacts or overexposed areas?",
    "explanation": "The glowing orbs in Image B emit a subtle glow that complements the overall lighting of the scene. The glow appears localized and soft, and there are no unnatural light artifacts or overexposed areas, which suggests a natural integration of light sources.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the etched patterns on the base of the glass jar sharp, detailed, and stylistically coherent with the steampunk aesthetic, without blurring or irregular lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the etched patterns on the base of the glass jar are sharp and detailed, matching the intricate and ornate designs typical of steampunk aesthetics. The lines are clear and consistent, and there is no blurring or irregularity observed, suggesting precision in their design execution.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the rusted metal background match the color and texture of the robot’s materials and blend seamlessly without visible edges or tonal inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of rusted metal, which harmonizes with the copper and brass color palette of the robot. The texture and tones of the background blend seamlessly with the robot, creating a cohesive visual scene without any visible edges or tonal inconsistencies that might detract from this uniformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
