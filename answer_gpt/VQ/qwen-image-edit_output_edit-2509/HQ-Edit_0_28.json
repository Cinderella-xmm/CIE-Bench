      "question": "Are the abstract geometric patterns on the man's robe seamlessly integrated into the fabric without introducing visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric patterns on the man's robe have been edited into the image as a stylized design. To assess their integration, I look for signs of editing such as uneven transitions, jagged edges, or color shifts that would suggest poor integration. In Image B, the patterns appear to follow the robe's natural contours, without visible disruptions or mismatches in color or texture, indicating a seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transformed lamp bases retain recognizable brass-like material properties and maintain proportional geometry consistent with their original structure when stylized as corner flourishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "I examine the edited parts surrounding the corners to see if they resemble the original lamp bases in terms of visual properties like color, shine, and geometry. The stylized flourishes in Image B maintain the golden tone and geometric curves typical of a brass-like appearance and show proportionate designs similar to the lamp bases, demonstrating consistency with the original material and structure.",

      "question": "Is the extended portion of the bookcase visually continuous with the original section, showing consistent shelf spacing, book alignment, and lighting without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "I evaluate Image B's extended bookcase by checking for continuity in terms of spacing between shelves, alignment of books, and light distribution from the lamps. In Image B, the bookcase appears uniformly extended without discernible seams or misalignments, maintaining the original visual continuity and shading, thus showing coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the script elements embedded within the bookcase surface rendered with appropriate transparency and scale so they do not obscure books or create unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine if the script elements are properly embedded, I check their transparency and placement regarding the books on the shelves. In Image B, they appear lightly superimposed with a level of transparency that allows the books to be visible beneath them, without causing unnatural layering effects or significant obstruction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the area intended for inspirational quotes display a clean, unobstructed region with consistent lighting and texture that allows for future text placement without visual disruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For future text placement, the area intended for quotes must be free from distracting objects or textures and have consistent lighting to support clear visibility. In examining Image B, the area seems clean and well-lit, without complex textures that could interfere with text visibility, making it suitable for future text addition.",
