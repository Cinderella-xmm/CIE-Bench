      "question": "Does the themed box appear to have a natural industrial aesthetic without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box displays an industrial and mechanical design, which includes metallic elements and intricate patterns that accompany the bearings. The textures integrated in the design appear consistent with what is expected of an industrial themed box, and do not exhibit any evident unnatural textures or artifacts that would detract from its realism or authenticity. Thus, the box successfully maintains a natural industrial aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the themed box in isometric perspective consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the themed box is portrayed in a manner where its proportions and angles align with what one would expect in an isometric perspective. The box appears consistent in its dimensions and does not show any visible distortions or irregularities in shape that could disrupt its geometric harmony. The perspective maintains a coherent view of a three-dimensional object.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bearings and components inside the box retain their fine details and appear precise without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays bearings and components within the box where they hold onto their inherent details. These elements illustrate fine and precise details, such as grooves and edges typical of industrial bearings. There is no apparent loss in detail, which suggests the components are accurately represented with clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic texture and intricate design of the primary bearing outside the box rendered photorealistically without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary bearing outside the box exhibits a metallic texture that is visually convincing, emphasizing reflective surfaces and intricate design patterns like grooves and metallic sheen. These aspects contribute to a photorealistic rendering, capturing the essence of a real-life bearing without displaying any unnatural textures that would question its authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bearings and components arranged in an organized manner both inside and outside the box, contributing to visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of bearings inside the box is systematic and visually coherent, with spaces allotted specifically for each component, reducing clutter and enhancing readability of the setup. Also, the components appear orderly in their disposition outside the box, contributing to a sense of organized placement and visual credibility in terms of how industrial elements would be logically organized.",
