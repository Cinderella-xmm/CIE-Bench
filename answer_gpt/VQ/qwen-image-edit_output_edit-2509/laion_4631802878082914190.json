    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters are positioned in ways that correspond to various steps in a data process journey. These positions relate directly to the labeled parts such as 'Data Prodaling' and 'Data Preparation.' The characters are situated on a circular path, and they do not overlap with or shift away from the areas corresponding to these process steps. Each character is placed in a manner that appears intentional and organized, maintaining the integrity of the original diagram's layout seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paths between characters visually follow the circular route outlined by the original diagram. They form a continuous loop around the central crystal, providing a clear directional flow akin to a circular process diagram. There are no abrupt turns or disruptive gaps, maintaining a cohesive and logical flow similar to the suggested cyclical steps seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a central crystal that is conspicuously placed at the nucleus of the circular path, mirroring the central data object in Image A. The crystal is adequately scaled to serve as a focal point without overwhelming or diminishing the surrounding characters, preserving the overall balance and visual hierarchy evident in an effective data flow diagram.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each character has an accompanying speech bubble appropriately positioned nearby without intrusive overlaps over characters or other visual components. However, while the placement is adequate, the text within these bubbles is gibberish, and the font size appears slightly inconsistent, detracting from legibility and uniformity in presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents characters interacting with various props such as a magnifying glass, laptop, and a clipboard. These interactions follow cartoon logic, where anatomy and ergonomics are less restrained. While this portrayal doesn't fully adhere to known animal anatomy or ergonomic standards, it is consistent with stylized artistic intent designed to infuse character with whimsical tasks. Therefore, the character-prop interactions, though not realistic, are suitable for the whimsical and educational tone of the illustration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B are cohesively rendered, maintaining consistency in line art thickness, shading depth, and color saturation. There are no abrupt changes in art style or mismatched textures, ensuring a harmonized visual aesthetic throughout, aligning with a unified artistic theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the title banner located at the top edge of the image, fully visible, and not overlapping any part of the diagram or characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is prominently located at the top edge of the image, fully visible without overlap onto other diagram components or characters. This placement ensures that the title is easily discernible and does not interfere with the main visual content, maintaining coherence and clarity.",
