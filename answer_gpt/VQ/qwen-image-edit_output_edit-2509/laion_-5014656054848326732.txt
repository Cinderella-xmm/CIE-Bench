    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire image rendered in a consistent sepia tone, with no areas retaining original color or showing abrupt transitions between color spaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the overall image is presented in a consistent sepia tone. This can be identified by the uniform brownish color throughout the image, a characteristic of sepia photography that gives it an aged, vintage look. There are no abrupt transitions between color spaces, as the sepia tone is applied evenly across all elements, including the man, the floral motifs, the furniture, and the background. This uniform application is typical of stylized sepia images.",
