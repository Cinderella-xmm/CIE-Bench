      "question": "Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D character's face in the edited image is intentionally blurred, obscuring any facial details, which prevents a definitive analysis of facial proportions or potential distortions. Therefore, the presence of unnatural distortions or artifacts in facial details cannot be accurately assessed due to the lack of visible information.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-like long-legged proportions of the 3D character visually plausible and structurally coherent, avoiding unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D character exhibits chibi-like proportions, which are characterized by exaggerated features such as long legs. This design choice is intentional and stylistically typical for chibi characters, implying a deliberate departure from realistic human proportions. The legs, despite being elongated, are visually coherent within the stylistic framework, showing no signs of unnatural distorting. Common world knowledge about chibi designs aligns such proportions with visual plausibility within this stylistic category.",

      "question": "Do the outfit and accessories of the 3D character incorporate the green and burnt orange hues naturally, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D character's outfit includes green pants and a burnt orange shirt, maintaining the color scheme presented in the original image. The textures and color transitions appear smooth and consistent with digital illustrations, thus avoiding unnatural textures or noticeable loss of detail. This is coherent and visually authentic within the boundaries of digital character rendering.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes accessories typical of modern fashion such as glasses, shoes, and a tablet or sketchbook. These items complement the overall style and color palette of the character, fitting naturally within the designed aesthetic. The integration appears clean without conflicting with the character's attire or proportions, maintaining a visually pleasing balance.",

      "question": "Does the solid background color complement and highlight the 3D character's overall color scheme without introducing any distracting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The solid green background serves to provide a clear and unobtrusive backdrop for the 3D character. This color complements the green elements in the character's attire and distribution of colors, enhancing overall visibility and focus without introducing distracting artifacts. The simple background effectively highlights the character without interfering with the visual cohesiveness.",
