      "question": "Do the Lego bricks representing the cobblestone path maintain a natural appearance without introducing obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone path is depicted using rectangular Lego bricks, which, although geometric and structured, simulate the appearance of a cobblestone street naturally. The texture typical of cobblestones is mimicked by the uniform seams between the bricks, avoiding any obvious unnatural textures since the straight edges are inherent to Lego designs. Hence, the Lego interpretation aligns with world knowledge of how Lego bricks are constructed, proving the naturalness within the constraints of toy bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Lego brick structures of the buildings coherent and visually credible, without any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in Image B are composed of Lego bricks, maintaining consistent geometric shapes like rectangular windows and doors. There are no visually broken or disorderly structures, illustrating a coherent and credible Lego cityscape. This adherence to geometric principles and world knowledge of how Lego models are built lends authenticity and credibility to the depiction without presence of any broken shapes.",

      "question": "Does the man's figure in the Lego diorama retain proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding unnatural body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The man's figure seen in Image B is styled after a standard Lego mini-figure. This inherently involves simplified and stylized proportions, which are generally recognized for their square bodies and round heads. These proportions fit within the typical Lego aesthetic and align with world knowledge of such toys, thus retaining proper physical rationality without introducing unnatural shapes relative to Lego design conventions.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the man's clothing and accessories been preserved in the Lego diorama without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures the man's clothing with surface details indicative of a Lego figure, maintaining overall simplicity without intricate details typical in the original photograph. The jacket and pants of the figure are simplified but not distorted beyond Lego-style norms; hence, there are no unnatural artifacts introduced, fitting within the credible Lego theme. World knowledge acknowledges that the representation is purposefully minimal due to the inherent design style.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the briefcase in the Lego diorama appear natural with correct ergonomics, lines, and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the briefcase in Image B is stylized after a typical Lego hand shape, which consists of a C-shaped grip. This matches the established ergonomics and simplification of Lego mini-figures, where the grip of the hand reflects the intended function. It does not introduce unnatural lines or textures and adheres to world knowledge of Lego design conventions, making it a natural representation within the Lego aesthetic.",
