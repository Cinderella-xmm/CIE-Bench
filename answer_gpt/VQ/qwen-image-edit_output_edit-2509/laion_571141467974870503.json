      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the bold primary colors applied to the train's body consistent across all surfaces without visible color bleeding or mismatched tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, bold primary colors like bright reds, greens, and blues are used to paint the train's body, giving it a pop art style appearance. The color blocks are meant to be solid and striking. Typically, in such artistic edits, consistency in color placement is crucial, ensuring no unintentional color bleeding or tone mismatches across different surfaces of the object's body. However, due to the nature of the pop art effect, colors can appear deliberately juxtaposed without gradient transitions. In this case, the application seems consistent without unintended overlaps or blending, which indicates intentionality in color placement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the halftone dot patterns on the train display consistent size, spacing, and alignment across all visible panels without distortion or clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone patterns are a staple of pop art, often characterized by uniform dot patterns used for shading and depth. The consistency in dot size, spacing, and alignment is key to maintaining the integrity of this artistic style. In Image B, upon examining the train and surrounding areas, the dot patterns appear uniform and evenly spaced without noticeable distortion or uneven clustering. This suggests that the halftone effect is applied consistently across the train's panels.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes used to replace the barn’s wood texture aligned with the original architectural elements such as windows, doors, and roofline without breaking their structural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B replaces the barn's wood texture with bold geometric shapes. Typically, when such design changes are made in a way that maintains structural boundaries, elements like windows, doors, and rooflines should remain clearly defined despite the artistic editing. This ensures that the integrity of the building's architecture is preserved. In Image B, the geometric design respects these structural boundaries; windows and the roofline maintain their positions without appearing misaligned or obstructed by other shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the graphic bursts representing foliage positioned in a way that respects the original spatial layout, with no overlapping or misplaced elements that contradict the scene’s depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, foliage is stylized with graphic bursts that must adhere to the original scene's spatial arrangement, maintaining depth perception and avoiding overlaps that disrupt the depiction of perspective and distance. Upon analysis, these graphic bursts of foliage appear carefully placed, respecting the depth and positioning relative to the train tracks and surrounding objects, thereby not contradicting the scene’s original intended layout.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black outlines around the train, barn, and foliage uniformly sharp, continuous, and free from gaps or misalignments at object edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, black outlines are a typical characteristic of comic or pop art, providing definition and edge to objects. Ideally, these outlines should be sharp and continuous, clearly delineating shapes and ensuring no gaps or misalignments occur around the edges of objects such as the train, barn, and foliage. Upon inspection, the outlines appear uniformly applied, maintaining sharpness and continuity without breaking across object edges, indicating a well-executed artistic edit.",
