      "question": "Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silk robe is decorated with floral patterns and subtle gold highlights. These elements should interact realistically with light, reflecting the properties of real silk fabric. The highlights and shadows on the robe seem evenly applied and consistent, suggesting a realistic texture and material property that matches how light typically reflects off silk. The floral patterns are integrated seamlessly into the fabric, further supporting the natural appearance of the robe.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book features layered pages that unfold, creating a three-dimensional effect. The depiction includes intricate details and depth, with layers forming mini-scenes. The edges appear precise, and the thickness of the pages is uniformly managed, suggesting structural coherence without any visual anomalies such as floating or inconsistently thick elements.",

      "question": "Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf behind the woman is depicted with numerous books lined up in an orderly fashion. The shelves appear evenly spaced, and the alignment of books maintains a coherent structure. The intricate design details above the bookshelf, such as ornamental trims, do not disrupt the bookshelf's basic alignment or spacing, enhancing visual integration without compromising structural rationality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmark panels are positioned on the table in front of the book, not inserted between the pages. They are detailed and thematically consistent with the book's elements, suggesting a connection but not a literal insertion. The placement on the table maintains proper scale and orientation relative to the book and overall composition, avoiding any visual indications of floating or misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question regarding facial features is not applicable as the face is blurred in Image B. Therefore, it is not possible to evaluate the proportional accuracy or any exaggeration/distortion regarding the eyes and mouth.",
