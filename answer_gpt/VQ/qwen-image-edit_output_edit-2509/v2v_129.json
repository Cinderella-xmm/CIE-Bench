        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the Chibi stickers represent a style that features characters with exaggerated proportions such as a larger head and smaller body, which is typical of Chibi art. The body in each sticker follows these proportion rules, maintaining consistent shapes and sizes characteristic of this art form. Hence, no unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes are observed, indicating correct proportional consistency.",
