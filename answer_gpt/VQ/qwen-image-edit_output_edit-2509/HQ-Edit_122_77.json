      "question": "Do the vine-like tendrils follow the natural contour of the head without floating or breaking apart at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine-like tendrils are integrated into the character's appearance. The tendrils are depicted as cascading and intertwining with the hair in a way that follows the contour of the head naturally. There is no visible separation or misalignment at the edges where these elements meet the head, suggesting the artist paid attention to maintaining a cohesive and realistic appearance concerning contours.",

      "question": "Are the laurel leaves and pastel flowers aligned naturally within the hair structure without overlapping the face or appearing detached from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the laurel leaves and pastel flowers incorporated into the hairstyle around the head. The placement appears intentional and integrated seamlessly with the hair, ensuring that none of these elements overlap with the face or appear strangely detached. The arrangement gives the impression of being part of an elaborate headdress, which aligns with artistic styling often seen in historical and mythological depictions.",

      "question": "Does the emerald green tunic show natural fabric folds and shading that match the posture and lighting of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald green tunic in Image B exhibits realistic fabric folds that conform to the body's posture, with appropriate shading to enhance the garment's dimensionality. The light source suggested by the environment is consistent with the shading and highlights present on the tunic, indicating that the artist took care to ensure the fabric looks natural and behaves as expected when draped over the body.",

      "question": "Are the twisted olive trees and marble fragments positioned at a plausible distance from the subject, with correct perspective and no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a scene set in an ancient ruin with twisted olive trees and marble fragments. The orientation and positioning of these elements are depicted convincingly, adhering to correct perspective rules. There is a plausible depth to the placement, ensuring that neither the trees nor the fragments appear misplaced or hovering unnaturally. The scene as a whole is illustrative of harmonious spatial arrangement.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the subjectâ€™s face and clothing align with the ambient light source suggested by the background environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B casts shadows on the character in a manner consistent with the suggested ambient light in the background, characterized by diffused sunlight filtering through the trees. The shadows align well with the light source conditions, suggesting careful attention to cohesive atmospheric rendering, which contributes to a realistic representation of the figure in the scene.",
