    "Question": "Q1: Does the ornate armor on the character's torso and limbs have consistent geometric structure and natural surface textures without visible distortion or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "The armor depicted in Image B is intricately detailed with geometric patterns and appears to have a consistent and natural surface texture, indicating high realism without any visible distortions or broken edges. This assessment is based on the visual cues such as the clarity of the lines, the coherence in the design across the limbs and torso, and the presence of shadows and highlights that emphasize the dimensionality of the armor.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the gem-studded scepter proportionally accurate and physically plausible in size and shape relative to the character’s hand, with no distorted or misaligned gemstones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scepter held by the character is ornate, featuring multiple gemstones. It appears proportionally accurate relative to the character's hand, fitting naturally with the grip and spatial context. The gemstones are aligned correctly without showing any signs of distortion or misalignment, maintaining a consistent physical plausibility in terms of size and shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the velvet cape exhibit natural draping behavior with realistic folds and shadows, and does it avoid unnatural intersections or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The velvet cape in Image B drapes naturally, displaying realistic folds and appropriate shadowing that suggests a material with depth and weight. The visual cues such as the flow of fabric, consistent shadow overlays, and absence of disjointed intersections or floating segments contribute to its plausible and realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the rolling hills and distant castle integrated smoothly into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow alignment, avoiding sharp edges or color discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rolling hills and distant castle are depicted with a smooth integration into the scene. The lighting and shadow alignment are consistent across the landscape, and there are no noticeable sharp edges or color discontinuities that would disrupt the seamlessness of the visual representation. The castle, although distant, fits naturally within the compositional angles of the landscape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the character’s right hand holding the scepter show five correctly shaped fingers with natural joint alignment and skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "The character’s right hand in Image B shows five fingers that are correctly shaped and naturally aligned. The hand's joint alignment and skin texture are convincingly rendered without any signs of deformation or the presence of extra digits, affirming a realistic portrayal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
