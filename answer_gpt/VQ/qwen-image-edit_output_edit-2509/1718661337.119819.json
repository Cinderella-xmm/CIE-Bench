      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the brown leather trench coat have consistent texture and natural folds that align with human body contours, and are the brass gears and mechanical details integrated without disrupting the coat's structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brown leather trench coat in Image B appears to have a consistent texture, typical of leather which usually has noticeable grain. The natural folds and contours allow the coat to adhere well to the assumed posture of the figure. The brass gears and mechanical details are precisely integrated into the design, complementing the steampunk theme without causing disruption to its overall structural integrity. The combination suggests deliberate and coherent design attention.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chronometer held in the right hand proportionally sized relative to the hand, with realistic shadows and reflections, and does it maintain a natural grip without distorted fingers or misplaced joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chronometer appears properly sized in relation to the right hand, reflecting an object that is graspable by a human hand. The shadows and reflections on the chronometer align with the lighting, creating a sense of dimensionality. The grip of the hand looks natural, with no indication of distorted fingers or joints, which implies a coherent render of the hand and object interaction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the goggles positioned on the tricorne hat in a way that respects the hatâ€™s structure, with no floating parts, unnatural shadows, or clipping errors between the goggles and the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goggles on the tricorne hat in Image B are positioned correctly, aligning seamlessly with the hat's structure. The visuals do not show any floating parts or unnatural shadows that would disrupt the visual coherence. The integration between the goggles and the hat appears solid with no clipping errors, ensuring a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the airships and floating cities in the background appear at appropriate distances, with consistent lighting and atmospheric perspective, and do they not overlap or obscure the subject unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B displays airships and floating cities that are carefully positioned, respecting spatial dynamics through perspectives and scale. Lighting consistency across these elements adds depth, and atmospheric perspective helps convey distance effectively. There is no unnatural overlap or obstruction of the main subject, preserving a cohesive scene composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the leather coat, brass gears, and other materials free from unnatural repetition, blurring, or artificial edges, and do fine details such as stitching and rivets remain sharp and consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather coat and brass gear textures in Image B are well-rendered, with no noticeable unnatural repetition that would disrupt realism. The clarity remains high, with stitching, rivets, and other fine details appearing sharp. The absence of blurring or artificial edges suggests careful attention to material rendering, maintaining a high level of detail across surfaces.",
