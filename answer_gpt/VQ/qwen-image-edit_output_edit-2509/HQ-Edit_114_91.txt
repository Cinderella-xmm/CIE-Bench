    "Question": "Q3: Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the anvil, root-like structures extend downwards with a realistic taper, emulating how tree roots naturally grow. They are connected to the anvil's base, showing no signs of floating in mid-air or appearing disconnected, which contributes to their lifelike representation.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The emerald runes in Image B are designed to appear as if they are embedded into the bark surface, demonstrating craftsmanship akin to carvings. These runes emit a soft glow that harmonizes with the bark texture. The glow is subtle, preventing harsh outlines or visible pixelation that would detract from their natural integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ivy tendrils are depicted as if they climb logically from the window frame and floor. These tendrils wrap around the hammer and anvil in a natural manner, without crossing through any solid objects. They adhere to surfaces in a realistic fashion, not appearing to float or be disconnected from the surroundings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
