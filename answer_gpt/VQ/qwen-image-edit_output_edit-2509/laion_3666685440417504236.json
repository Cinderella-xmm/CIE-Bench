      "question": "Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome, minaret, and arches appear well-rendered within the miniaturized globe setting. The proportions seem correct as the elements align well with common architectural features typical of historical Islamic architecture, with the dome being a prominent feature. There are no visible signs of distortion such as warped edges or broken lines. The structure maintains symmetry and consistency, indicating intact geometry.",

      "question": "Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestone path in Image B appears to be leading towards the entrance of the architectural structure, which indicates a purposeful layout that can commonly be seen in garden or courtyard settings. The palm trees are scaled appropriately in relation to the architecture, as they are not overly large or small relative to the building, thus maintaining a harmonious balance indicative of a thoughtfully designed landscape.",

      "question": "Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exterior of the globe in Image B features intricate Persian patterns that are continuous and appear to be evenly spaced. These patterns are stylistically consistent with traditional Persian and Islamic art, which often includes complex geometric patterns and calligraphy. In comparison with Image A, the patterns on the globe echo the style of the tilework, maintaining aesthetic continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the dome and arches are subtle and seem to mimic natural light reflection, which is typical when sunlight hits a curved surface. There do not appear to be flat or overly bright lines that would suggest artificial enhancement. The highlights are proportionately applied, enhancing the dimensions and giving a realistic depth to the structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The separation between the interior scene and the globe's surface in Image B is carefully rendered, showcasing a clear boundary. There are no noticeable jagged edges or glitches that disrupt the continuity of the scene, and the reflection is managed well, with no unnatural appearance. It gives a seamless integration into the globe's structure.",
