    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and mouth are drawn onto the whoopie pie surfaces with a cartoonish style. Analyzing whether they align with the curvature involves checking if they follow the rounded shape of the pie without causing visual incongruities like stretching or floating away from the surface. The drawing appears to be seamlessly integrated onto the pie's surface, following its contours accurately, without any floating or distorted appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",
    "explanation": "The visual inspection of Image B shows the cookie has been stylized with cartoon-like features, but the original texture of cracks and dimples inherent to the whoopie pie's surface is not visible, suggesting it is smoothed out. This lends a more flat, uniform, and artificial appearance to the cookie contrary to its natural pattern.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the whoopie pie characters are drawn in a way that complements the overall body size, attached at reasonable anatomical limb points such as the edges where limbs would naturally sprout. They appear proportionate to the body's scale and do not seem detached or awkwardly misaligned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
    "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows the leading whoopie pie character holding a spatula that appears proportionate in size, suggesting a natural grip suitable for its character size. The orientation of the spatula fits comfortably within the pie's hand-like structure and does not look out of place.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are designed to appear peering over the edge of a flat cartoon plate, with their lower halves seemingly anchored below the plate's contour. There are no instances of limbs floating or appearing cut-off, indicating the characters are well-integrated into their environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the text bubble containing “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” placed adjacent to the speaking character without overlapping critical features like eyes or limbs, and is the handwritten font clear and unblurred?",
    "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B is positioned near the speaking whoopie pie character without overlaying essential facial features such as eyes or limbs. The handwritten font is legible and appears distinct, ensuring clear communication without visual interference.",
    "answer": "Yes"
