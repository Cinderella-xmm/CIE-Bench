      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog uniformly shaped, properly aligned, and free of distorted or misshapen pieces that compromise structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are used to construct the shape of a hot dog and appear to be uniformly shaped and properly aligned. The bricks seem to fit together well, maintaining a consistent structure without signs of distortion or misalignment. This is congruent with the typical characteristics of LEGO constructions, which rely on the precision and uniformity of each piece to create stable structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ceramic mosaic bottle feature smooth, non-glass-like surfaces with clearly defined geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan, without unnatural reflections or transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B is constructed from LEGO bricks, creating a mosaic appearance with geometric patterns. This gives the illusion of a ceramic item but does not actually have the smooth or non-glass-like texture of true ceramic, as LEGO bricks have more rigid surfaces. The patterns are clearly defined by the different colored bricks, noticeable in red, yellow, and other colors. The overall texture indicates that the surface would be more blocky and angular due to the LEGO bricks, without unnecessary reflections or transparency, which wouldn't be expected in a LEGO mosaic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the LEGO hot dog's length proportionally consistent with the original hot dogâ€™s size relative to the cutting board and nearby objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the hot dog is a regular food item placed on a cutting board. In Image B, the hot dog is made from LEGO bricks, simulating the appearance and position of the original hot dog. Comparing the two, the LEGO hot dog maintains a similar proportional length to the cutting board and nearby objects, showing a consistent size relationship. This suggests that the conversion to LEGO has maintained the relative dimensions accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ceramic bottle have a rounded, flowing shape with no sharp angles or blocky geometry that would disrupt visual harmony with the LEGO hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image B depicts a bottle made from LEGO bricks, mimicking a ceramic bottle's appearance. However, due to the nature of LEGO, the bottle's structure inherently includes sharp angles and blocky geometry as opposed to naturally rounded and flowing shapes. This contrasts with the more organic form of the original hot dog in LEGO form, but considering both are made from LEGO, it does create a visual harmony within this playful context, despite the individual characteristics of LEGO bricks.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden base under both the LEGO hot dog and ceramic bottle seamless, with consistent wood grain and color matching the surrounding table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base the LEGO structures rest upon appears to be a cutting board or similar wooden surface. The grain and coloration of this wooden base match closely with that of the surrounding table surface. This consistency suggests a seamless visual integration between the base and tabletop. However, any discontinuity in the material isn't discernible, indicating a uniform appearance.",
