      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser is constructed using LEGO bricks. LEGO constructions often have visible seams due to the nature of the bricks. The texture appears to have the characteristic grid-like pattern of LEGO bricks, leading to inconsistencies in surface flatness and texture. Therefore, the brown LEGO bricks are not perfectly smooth and may have gaps or visible seams. Considering the properties of LEGO bricks, it's reasonable to conclude that there's a likelihood of visible gaps or irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The herringbone marquetry pattern, known for its intricate design, becomes challenging to replicate using LEGO. In Image B, replicating such intricate patterns with LEGO may lead to discontinuities or imperfect alignment due to the blocky nature of the pieces, which do not easily mimic fine, continuous marquetry patterns. This complexity suggests that the pattern is likely not perfectly continuous and may have breaks or missing segments.",

      "question": "Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes LEGO bricks to mimic the gold decorative borders. LEGOâ€™s linear nature makes it challenging to create smooth, curved contours, usually resulting in more angular shapes with potential sharp angles. Consequently, the borders in LEGO might not entirely match the smooth flow of the original design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side panels and cabriole legs in Image B are created using LEGO, which typically involves visible steps due to the individual parts. The blocks' shape makes it hard to achieve smooth curves without noticeable angular steps. Thus, given the characteristic nature of LEGO construction, visible steps or angular breaks are likely present in the profile.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the dresser is made with LEGO tiles. Given the inherently precise nature of LEGO, the tiles are usually able to sit flat and level if assembled correctly. The edge between the sides and the top may have minimal gaps typical of LEGO assembly, but generally, LEGO constructions ensure that the top sits relatively flat and level. It's reasonable to conclude that the LEGO tile top is likely aligned with clean edges based on typical LEGO design precision.",
