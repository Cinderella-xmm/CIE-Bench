      "question": "Are the transitions between the man's clothing and the cow's fur smooth and free of unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to evaluate the transition between the man's clothing and the cow's fur, we observe any lines or texture changes where these two elements meet. The man's arm and the rope visually connect him to the cow, and no obvious unnatural texture or artifact is visible at these junctures, suggesting the transitions are smooth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the combined figure, including the size of the horns relative to the body, appear physically plausible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cow's horns look appropriately sized relative to its body, typical for Highland cattle. The man's positioning next to the cow appears proportionate, with no distortions in either part of the combined figure. When analyzing against Image A, proportions remain consistent, suggesting plausibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the details of the man's white coat and the cow's fur well-preserved and free from unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows the details in the man's suit and the cow's fur are clear and distinct. The texture is visible, with no significant pixelation or blurring apparent when viewed. Compared to Image A, the details remain sharp and consistent, indicating preservation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the posture of the combined figure, including the positioning of the legs and head, appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the cow's posture and the man's stance appear natural; the cow walks forward while the man leads it, consistent with expected behavior in such scenarios. This corresponds with Image A's depiction, suggesting continuity and natural positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the combined figure within the scene, including its interaction with the grass and background, appear visually credible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man and cow interact appropriately with the surrounding grass and background scene. The shadows and alignment fit naturally into the environment. Like Image A, there's visual credibility in the scene's placement and integration, indicating accurate positioning.",
