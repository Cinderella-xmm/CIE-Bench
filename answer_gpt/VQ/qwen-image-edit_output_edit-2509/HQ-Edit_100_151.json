      "question": "Does the child's coat maintain a coherent shape with natural folds and no distorted or broken seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's coat appears to maintain a coherent shape with naturally positioned folds and no visible distortions or broken seams. The coat is rendered smoothly, with the pockets and button details accurately placed. This assessment is based on visual inspection and common understanding of how clothing typically folds and sits on a body.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloon surfaces evenly colored in pastel tones without visible color bleeding or loss of specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the balloons are colored in pastel tones with a smooth and even application. There appears to be no color bleeding between the balloons, and the highlights on their surfaces are consistent with how light typically interacts with spherical objects, maintaining their specular highlights.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the child’s right hand holding the balloons have exactly five fingers with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s right hand, which is holding the balloons, appears to have five fingers. Each finger is naturally aligned with no extra or missing digits, following common anatomical structure and proportion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the watercolor texture applied uniformly across the wheat field without disrupting the visibility of individual stalks or creating unnatural stroke lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheat field in Image B exhibits a consistent watercolor texture that allows for the visibility of individual stalks. The texturing enhances the field's appearance without introducing unnatural stroke lines, maintaining a uniform and natural look.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the calendar grid positioned at ground level and aligned with the path beneath the child, without floating or casting unrealistic shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid is visibly superimposed at the bottom of the image and does not correspond with any elements at ground level. It appears more as an overlay rather than an element being part of the scene's ground, thus it does not align with the path beneath the child in a three-dimensional sense and does not cast shadows.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the clouds in the sky maintain natural edges and volume without visible pixelation or unnatural smoothing effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are rendered with natural edges and volume. They show a smooth transition in gradients and maintain a realistic appearance without any signs of pixelation or unnatural smoothing, consistent with the fluffy texture one would expect in a clear sky.",
