    "Question": "Q1: Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?",
    "explanation": "The image features a figure in a kneeling position, where the hands are visible with fingers spread naturally. The fingers appear proportionate and properly aligned with no signs of distortion or unnatural joint placement. Common knowledge about hand anatomy supports the visual observation of five fingers per hand.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
    "explanation": "The edited figure is in a dynamic leaping pose, indicating forward motion. The legs are shown extended, and the torso is aligned with the direction of movement, portraying an arced momentum characteristic of leaping. There is no visible warping or unnatural bending, suggesting anatomical integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
    "explanation": "Observation of the leaping figure shows knees bent and pulled towards the chest, characteristic of a dynamic leap or jump. The curvature of the knees appears natural with no deformation or exaggerated muscular shapes. The position aligns with typical poses used to convey motion and agility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "The bold outlines in the image encapsulate the figure effectively, adhering to the contours of the character smoothly. The lines exhibit consistent thickness and maintain their alignment across forms without lapses or disruptions into adjacent color regions, reflecting quality illustration standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
    "explanation": "The visual arrangement of text and step numbers shows an intentional placement away from the central action, allowing key features like limbs and movements of the figure to remain unobstructed. The captions are strategically placed to complement the illustration rhythm without infringing on character visual clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
    "explanation": "The instructional graphic incorporates simplified versions of the character. These figures maintain a proportional scale relative to the original character, ensuring coherence in visual representation. The perspective alignment in each step visually matches the dynamic character pose depicted, preserving visual consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
