      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks used to form the bed frame, mattress, and base are examined closely. They appear to be neatly aligned with no visible gaps between them, suggesting proper interlocking. The consistency in the alignment reflects adherence to typical LEGO construction techniques, where bricks are designed to fit snugly together.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the duvet's light blue floral pattern, as depicted through LEGO bricks, mirrors the designs seen in Image A without apparent errors in color arrangement or gaps. The motif seems consistently replicated across both images, maintaining continuity in the bed's aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headboard displays a curved design formed by staggered LEGO bricks, achieving a realistic LEGO curvature consistent with typical LEGO construction principles. The bricks seamlessly create a rounded appearance without any noticeable stretching or deformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the pillows are constructed using stacked LEGO bricks that effectively simulate a three-dimensional shape, mirroring the layers seen in standard pillows. The construction appears cohesive, with no floating or visibly disconnected pieces, capturing a realistic and integrated form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the shadows cast by the LEGO bed align with the original lighting direction in Image A, maintaining similar softness and consistency. There are no noticeable discrepancies such as unnatural dark spots or excessively bright areas that contrast with the lighting seen in the original image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image A and Image B, the proportions and positional arrangements of the pillows, duvet, and headboard appear consistent across both images. No scaling anomalies or misplacements are observed, ensuring that all elements of the LEGO bed in Image B maintain similarity with the original bed's configuration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays LEGO bricks with a consistent matte finish, typical of LEGO bricks, avoiding any inappropriate glossiness, transparency, or pixelation. This consistent appearance indicates high-quality rendering without the indication of low-quality graphic issues.",
