      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the fur of the plush dog looks consistently soft and textile-like, which is indicative of a well-rendered texture.

      "question": "Is the crystal-studded corset properly aligned with the dog's torso and does it display consistent, physically plausible reflections and sparkle without distorted shapes or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The corset in Image B is designed with crystal studs that are meticulously aligned with the dog's torso, maintaining symmetry and balance. The sparkle and reflections appearing on the corset are consistent with light interactions one would expect from crystal material, thereby showcasing no distortions or misplaced elements.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dog's paws resting on the shelf edge with a realistic and slightly dangling posture. There is no evidence of intersecting or floating above the shelf, which suggests the paws are placed correctly according to spatial logic expected in such a scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing the sandy-colored spots in Image B to those in Image A, we see that Image B maintains similar placement and shape without bleeding or distortion, preserving their integrity and appearance in line with the original image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis is focused on the external structures and features of the plush dog. Since the face is blurred, we're disregarding direct observation of specific features like the snout, mouth, and nose. However, considering the rest of the visible aspects of the image are proportionate and coherent, we can infer that the editing is thorough, keeping everything proportional, as expected.",
