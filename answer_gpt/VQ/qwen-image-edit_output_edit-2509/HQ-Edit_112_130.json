      "question": "Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a woman in a richly decorated brocade gown with puffy sleeves and a full skirt. The fabric appears to have natural folds and volume, consistent with how heavy brocade would drape. There are no visible areas that seem stretched or flattened, indicating attention to detail in preserving the fabric's natural characteristics through its texture and layering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roses in the image are distributed around the upper part of the image. They exhibit a variety of petal shapes and colors, which is natural for roses. The distribution is even, and the direction of light seems consistent across the flowers, as shadows and highlights are correctly aligned, giving them a natural appearance without suggesting they were pasted or duplicated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues are integrated into the environment with consistent line work. The shadows they cast are coherent with the light direction observed elsewhere in the image, and the spatial alignment relative to the ground and trees is logical, creating a believable scene without misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left hand of the woman holding the violin displays the correct number of five fingers, with natural spacing and curvature. The right hand's grip on the bow appears technically correct and physically plausible, without the presence of extra digits or any distortion at the joints.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brocade patterns on the gown and the texture of the gazebo and statues show intricate detail with no visible repeated tiles or pixelation that would indicate poor resolution. The stone statues and metal mesh feature realistic textures with appropriate variations, which avoid any unnatural smoothness and maintain a high-quality, plausible appearance.",
