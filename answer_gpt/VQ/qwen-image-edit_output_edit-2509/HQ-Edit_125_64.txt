    "Question": "Q1: Is the sun disc replacing the Sphinx’s head seamlessly integrated with the neck and body, showing no jagged edges or misaligned contours?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sun disc and the Sphinx's body appear to be merged seamlessly. There are no visible jagged edges or misaligned contours where the sun disc meets the body. The integration appears smooth and consistent, suggesting a skillful blend with the existing contours of the neck and body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the golden wings extend symmetrically from the sides of the Sphinx’s body with smooth, continuous surfaces and natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the golden wings extend symmetrically from both sides of the Sphinx's body, creating an impression of balanced symmetry. The surfaces of the wings are smooth, with a natural curvature that complements the posture of the Sphinx, indicating a harmonious integration with the body's contours.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the sand flows on the limbs continuous and gravity-consistent, without abrupt breaks or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sand flows on the limbs of the Sphinx manifest as soft, flowing appendages. There is an observable consistency in terms of direction, resembling gravity-driven movement. The continuity of these flows is maintained throughout, without abrupt or disjointed breaks, suggesting a coherent integration with the surrounding environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ankhs on the paws correctly shaped, properly scaled, and emitting a soft, localized glow without distorting adjacent textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ankhs placed on the Sphinx's paws are symmetrical and correctly proportioned. The glow emitted from them is soft, enhancing their visual emphasis without impacting the surrounding textures. There is no distortion noted in the adjacent areas, indicating precise integration and design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire edited figure exhibit consistent lighting and shading across all added elements, with no visible seams or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows consistent lighting and shading across the various elements added to the Sphinx figure, such as the wings, sun disc, and the ankhs. These elements harmonize well with the original lighting conditions evident in the sky, ensuring unified visual coherence. There are no noticeable seams or mismatched textures on the figure, indicating skillful editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
