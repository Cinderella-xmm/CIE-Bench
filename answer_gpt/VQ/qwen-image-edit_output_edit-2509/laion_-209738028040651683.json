The gown appears to imitate the luxurious and intricate designs of historical dresses, typically made from fine materials like silk or satin, which have distinct textures and layering. The fabric should exhibit smooth gradients, delicate detailing, and natural folds, which are visible without obvious digital seams or pixelation. The reflection details and texture continuity show a consistent design without unnatural breaks.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The powdered wig in Image B is examined for alignment and volume relative to the head shape. Such wigs are known for their voluminous and elaborate structure, intended to fit seamlessly over a person's head. It should flow naturally from the head without appearing disconnected or floating. The wig in the image follows the contours of the head and exhibits realistic cascading locks typical of wigs from the period represented, with no visible gaps or misalignments.",

      "question": "Are the added pearl accessories rendered with consistent lighting and surface reflection, showing no unnatural highlights or ghosting around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pearl accessories are analyzed for lighting and reflection consistency. Pearls usually display a soft luster and unique reflective properties â€” hence, whether they correctly capture ambient lighting with appropriate highlights is key. The pearls should not have exaggerated or fake-looking shine, as this would indicate poor rendering. The image shows the pearls with smooth surface reflections, consistent lighting, and no ghosting, indicating a high-quality rendering.",
