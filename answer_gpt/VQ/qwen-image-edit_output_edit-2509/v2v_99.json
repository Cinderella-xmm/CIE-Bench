      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D soccer player visually contrasts with the realistic environment of the soccer field and stadium. The chibi player's design, characterized by exaggerated proportions and cartoony features, does not seamlessly blend with the detailed textures and realistic framework of the stadium and field seen in Image A. The player appears slightly out of place against the realistic background, highlighting the stylistic differences between the character and its surroundings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd still visually plausible and structurally coherent, without any distortions or unnatural textures introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd maintain a visual consistency that reflects real-world environments. The editing involving the player maintains structural integrity, preserving the realistic appearance and textures of the stadium components. No distortions or noticeable unnatural textures are introduced in Image B that disrupt the scene's plausibility.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D soccer player exhibits proportions typical of chibi designs, characterized by a larger head relative to the body and simplified forms. These proportions are consistent within the design logic of such characters. There are no elements that appear geometrically broken or unnaturally distorted, suggesting that the chibi player maintains a coherent structural integrity within its stylistic framework.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the chibi-style 3D soccer player look natural and free of any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the chibi-style player with materials and textures that are smooth and consistent with typical digital creations. Despite the stylization, the textures are applied evenly without artifacts, maintaining a polished appearance. The color and surface details align well with digital rendering standards for such stylized 3D characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the action pose of the chibi-style 3D soccer player consistent with the original image, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image A shows the soccer player in a dynamic pose, kicking the ball towards the goal. Image B mirrors this action with the chibi-style player, who replicates the pose effectively. While stylized, the action and physical dynamics are logically preserved, maintaining visual credibility in terms of movement and pose. This consistency suggests the chibi player accurately represents the action seen in the original image.",
