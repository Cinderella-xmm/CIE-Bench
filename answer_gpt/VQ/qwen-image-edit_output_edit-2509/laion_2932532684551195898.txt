    "Question": "Q1: Are the orange and yellow flower petals in the headpiece free from color banding, pixelation, or sharp, unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flower petals exhibit smooth and consistent color transitions without any visible issues such as color banding or pixelation. The edges appear naturally soft and well-defined, contributing to a realistic look, likely due to high-quality rendering consistent with digital graphics standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the black, orange, and yellow braids in the headpiece maintain consistent thickness, smooth curvature, and uninterrupted strand alignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays the braids with well-maintained thickness and smoothness. The curvature of the braids is consistent, typical of well-rendered graphics or finely crafted physical models, contributing to a realistic and cohesive appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the gold earrings reduced in size and repositioned on the headpiece while preserving their intricate mesh patterns and metallic sheen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold earrings maintain their original position similar to Image A and are not reduced or repositioned. They retain intricate mesh patterns and the metallic sheen, which indicates careful preservation of design details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the flowers, braids, and earrings positioned so that they appear physically connected to the head and hair without gaps or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elements of the headpiece including flowers, braids, and earrings appear naturally connected to the head and hair, without any visible gaps or floating effects. This suggests precise alignment and integration of these elements to the headpiece.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible seams, unnatural shadows, or texture discontinuities at the edges of the headpiece where it meets the face or hair?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show any seams, unnatural shadows, or texture discontinuities at the junctions of the headpiece with the face or hair. The transitions between these elements are seamless and consistent, typical of high-quality digital or crafted work.",
    "answer": "No"
