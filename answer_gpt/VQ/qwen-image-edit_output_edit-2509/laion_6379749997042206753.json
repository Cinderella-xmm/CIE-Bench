      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kernel character, dressed in autumn attire, does not maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, which are generally smaller and harder. The character is disproportionately large with a softer, cartoonish texture. The clothing, designed for stylistic purposes rather than realistic integration, visually contrasts with the kernel's texture and edges can be observed clearly without seamless integration, typical for cartoon illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy lines are animated graphically to illustrate popping action in a cartoon style. These lines are smooth, and they emanate from the popcorn piece consistently with the depicted explosive motion without distorting or intersecting the popcorn shapes, which is typical for expressive cartoon illustrations where clarity of action is prioritized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the popcorn piece with the explorer hat is cartoonishly stylized and not scaled relative to actual popcorn pieces. Its texture matches the illustration's style rather than realistic popcorn. The spices and pumpkins are similarly stylized and positioned to create an illustrative scene, free of overlapping distortions due to deliberate positioning for thematic consistency, typical in stylized art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cartoon popcorn kernels entering ceramic bowls. Their trajectory shows a lively, animated motion consistent with gravity, and they are positioned to remain within bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rims. This is consistent with cartoon representations where motion and interactive elements enhance the narrative and visual coherency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme integrates into the original theme with a consistent palette of orange and brown hues. The elements like hats, energy lines, and spices are illustrated without over-saturation or bleeding at the edges, maintaining a clear distinction and visual harmony typical of stylized and thematic cartoon illustrations.",
