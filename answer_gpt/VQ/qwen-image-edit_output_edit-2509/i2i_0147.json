      "question": "Does the melted cheese appear with a natural texture and color, without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the melted cheese shows a smooth, glossy surface which is typical when it melts over hot food like a sausage. There are no visible distortions or unnatural colors; the cheese retains the expected yellow-orange hue. The texture and shading suggest it has melted naturally over the hot dogs in response to the heat of the grill.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fried onions positioned naturally on the hot dog, avoiding any distortion or breakage of geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fried onions in Image B are placed atop the cheese and sausages. They appear to have a natural curl and golden-brown color, consistent with properly fried onions. The shapes are smooth and continuous, indicating a natural placement without any unrealistic distortions or breaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the melted cheese and fried onions blend seamlessly with the hot dog buns and sausages, preserving structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cheese rests smoothly on the sausages and partially on the buns, under the fried onions. The integration looks seamless as the cheese conforms to the shape of the sausages naturally. The onions lay on top, adding texture without breaking the overall form of the hot dogs. This indicates that all ingredients are integrated naturally, maintaining consistent structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the melted cheese and fried onions preserved without losing clarity or introducing blurry textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows clear, sharp edges on the cheese and onions, which display a high level of detail and texture. The cheese has smooth highlights, and the onions' texture shows crispiness, both indicative of high-detail preservation without any blurriness.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the barbecue tong look naturally placed near the grill, maintaining its structural integrity and proportion with the rest of the image elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barbecue tong is positioned as if holding one of the hot dogs, its jaws gripping without distortion. The size and metallic texture match what would be expected of a tong in relation to the size of the hot dogs and grill, indicating it is proportionally correct and not out of place or distorted.",
