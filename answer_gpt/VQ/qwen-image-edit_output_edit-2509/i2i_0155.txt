    "Question": "Q1: Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?",
    "explanation": "The 'Breathe' text is placed in the top left corner within a leaf-themed border design. This placement doesn't interfere with the plant itself as it is located away from the plant's structure, ensuring that the plant's appearance remains intact. From a visual standpoint, the text appears to harmonize with the overall aesthetic due to the choice of colors and style, which complements the plant theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?",
    "explanation": "The 'Calm' text with its leafy border is situated at the bottom right corner of the image. It is positioned adjacent to the window but does not overlap or distort the window frame. The placement is visually separate from the window structure, and there is no indication that the geometry of the window is affected by this addition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in the edited image appears consistent with the source in both images, which is natural daylight coming from the right. The shadows and highlights on the leaves do not show any signs of distortion or inconsistency. The addition of text does not seem to affect the lighting and shadow details, as they remain coherent with the direction of the light source.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?",
    "explanation": "Examining the pot and the saucer, the texture remains consistent with a typical terracotta appearance, highlighting its natural colors and surface qualities. The inclusion of the texts 'Breathe' and 'Calm' are spatially distant from the pot area, thus they do not influence or introduce any texture artifacts to the pot and saucer.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?",
    "explanation": "The placement of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' is outside the plant's region and is neatly positioned in corners of the image, which maintains the symmetry and balance of the composition. The texts are effectively compact and decorative, avoiding any interference with the plant's shape or the window's original symmetry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
