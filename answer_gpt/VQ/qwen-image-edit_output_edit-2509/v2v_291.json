      "question": "Do the hippo and rabbit maintain their natural proportions and structural consistency in the 3D cartoon design without any visible distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo and rabbit appear in a cartoonish 3D design. Typically, such designs may exaggerate certain features for stylistic purposes. Upon checking, both animals maintain recognizable features relevant to their species—such as the hippo's robust body and the rabbit's furry texture—indicating that while cartoonish, the proportions are consistent with common depictions. Comparison with Image A shows a transition from realistic to stylized, but the consistency in proportions remains recognizable and unexaggerated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gentle lighting and cozy tones in the 3D design enhance the natural appearance of the hippo and rabbit without creating any unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B provides a warm and gentle ambiance, which is typical for cartoon styles aiming for a friendly appearance. The soft shadows and highlights contribute to making the hippo and rabbit look naturally integrated into the scene. Comparing to Image A, where natural light is more straightforward, the lighting in Image B is softer but still maintains a believable effect without introducing harsh or unnatural shadows.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the hippo's skin texture and the rabbit's fur preserved in the 3D design without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a 3D cartoon interpretation, which often simplifies textures to accommodate stylistic choices. However, the essential details, like the hippo's characteristic skin folds and the rabbit's furry texture, are preserved in a stylized manner, avoiding unnatural artifacts. Comparing Image A, with realistic textures, with Image B, the cartoon style simplifies but maintains recognition of the animals' characteristic details.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the title banner and nameplate integrate seamlessly with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, maintaining visual credibility and not disrupting the harmony between the characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a card-like design with a title banner and nameplate at the top and bottom, respectively. These elements are characteristic of trading card designs, complementing the 3D cartoon animals without overpowering or disrupting the overall aesthetic. The design elements do not visually interfere with the depiction of the hippo and rabbit, retaining a cohesive appeal.",

      "question": "Does the nature-inspired backdrop with earthy greens and rich tones blend naturally with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, avoiding any visual inconsistencies or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features earthy greens and warm tones which contribute to a serene nature-inspired setting. This background effectively complements the cartoon style of the hippo and rabbit, ensuring a visually coherent scene. Such tones are harmonious with the depiction and do not introduce inconsistencies or clash with the natural style shown. Compared to Image A's natural environment, the stylized setting in Image B maintains natural integrity.",
