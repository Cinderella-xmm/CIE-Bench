      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being converted into a stained glass style, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard has been altered to resemble a stained glass pattern, with vibrant colors and geometric designs replacing its original texture. The structural form of the skateboard still resembles a functional object with recognizable contours and placement of wheels, despite the artistic transformation. This indicates an adherence to maintaining its visual credibility while embracing the stained glass effect.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the kitchen sink and cabinets preserved without distortion, maintaining their physical rationality in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stained glass effect applied to the cabinets, their geometric continuity is maintained. The lines and shapes are intact, preserving the cabinet's structure and the sink's outline. This preservation ensures the cabinets appear physically plausible even with the artistic overlay.",

      "question": "Does the stained glass effect applied to the countertop and backsplash tiles appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The countertop and backsplash in Image B are distinctly transformed into vibrant stained glass designs. This effect is applied uniformly, maintaining clarity and cohesiveness, without visible artifacts or distortions. The texture seems intentional and seamlessly blends with the overall stained glass theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets visually credible and coherent, without any noticeable breaks or inconsistencies in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass effect is applied to all surfaces, creating a harmonious visual flow. Each object, including the skateboard and cabinets, is integrated smoothly, with no apparent discontinuities in the transition between them, giving the scene a unified appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details of the objects, such as the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles, remain authentic and detailed within the stained glass style, avoiding any degradation of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass style still allows for discernible details like the buttons on the skateboard and handles on the cabinets. While these elements adopt the stained glass aesthetic, their form and function are clear with fine details preserved, ensuring they remain recognizable and fitting within the theme.",
