    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the branches of the tree composed of clean, angular geometric lines consistent with Art Deco style, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branches are crafted with precise, geometric lines that reflect Art Deco style. The shape is smooth and orderly, resembling stylized and clean design typical of Art Deco. This indicates intention in maintaining a coherent style, representing elegance without irregularities or rough edges. Therefore, analyzing these cues leads to the conclusion that the branches are geometrically consistent with Art Deco elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass in the foreground display muted, uniform coloration with preserved textural details such as individual blades or soft gradients, rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features realistically textured grass, maintaining its natural look while being a consistent part of the overall stained glass aesthetic. The coloration is subdued, exhibiting a range of green shades that preserve textural details through gradients rather than the appearance of being flat or overly stylized. This attention to detail ensures a naturalistic representation consistent with the desired stained glass effect, without sacrificing clarity or realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mountain silhouettes composed of defined angular planes in bronze and teal tones, maintaining layered depth and spatial consistency without overlapping or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted using angular forms that are well-defined with distinct bronze and teal tones. These planes create a sense of depth and perspective, with layers that appear coherent in terms of spatial composition. There are no anomalies such as overlapping or disjointed sections, contributing to the overall aesthetic authenticity. The color choice and separation of layers contribute to the cohesive imagery consistent with art styles that focus on geometric forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient from dark at the top to lighter near the horizon, with thin, evenly spaced accent lines that follow the curvature of the scene without intersecting or distorting the starfield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is crafted with a smooth transition from dark to light, representing a typical natural gradient found at sunrise or twilight. This gradient maintains its harmony with the design elements of the scene. Thin accent lines enhance the artistic depiction and follow the curvature around the tree and mountains, without crossing or misaligning with the stars. This consistent visual coherence aligns with typical aesthetics in painted or stained glass designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—tree, mountains, and sky—rendered with consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills, lacking transparent patches, misaligned edges, or inconsistent shading within the same layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is consistent in its stained glass depiction, employing uniform outlines and fills overall. Each component—the tree, mountains, and sky—is bounded by coherent edges with solid fills typical of stained glass, preventing inaccuracies like transparent or misaligned areas. The shading is consistent within each element, portraying a unified artistic style with no deviations in design, contributing to the authenticity and aesthetic integrity.",
