Instead, the stone sculpture portrays ornaments and details typical to stone carvings found in classical sculptures, focusing more on the jewelry and clothing details rather than detailed textile patterns. There is no textile pattern like floral and paisley shown, hence there are no concerns of blurring or geometric deformation.",
