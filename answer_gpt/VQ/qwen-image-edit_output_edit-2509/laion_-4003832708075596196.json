      "question": "Do the transformed trunk sections into arms and legs follow natural joint-like curves and avoid sharp, unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunk has been transformed to resemble human-like characters with arms and legs. These limbs exhibit a smooth, natural curve that resembles human joints rather than sharp bends. This suggests an intent to mimic natural limb movement, avoiding harsh angles that would look unnatural. This conclusion is based on world knowledge of how human limbs generally appear and bend.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaf-shaped heads composed of intact maple leaves with visible veins and gradient coloring, and do the facial features (eyes, mouth) sit naturally on the surface without distorting the leaf shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the leaf-shaped heads maintain the outline of a typical maple leaf, though the veins are not prominently detailed. Facial features such as eyes and mouth are added on top of the leaves. These features are well-integrated, not distorting the leaf shape. The gradient coloring typical of maple leaves is present, supporting the natural appearance using world knowledge visual representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the hats and scarves rendered with the same flat, vector-style design as the rest of the image, and do they have consistent edge lines and no visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hats and scarves are created in a flat, vector-style that aligns with the design of the tree and leaves, adhering to the aesthetic consistency of the entire illustration. The edge lines are uniform, and there are no visible textures or artifacts that diverge from the vector art style. World knowledge of vector graphics helps in identifying the uniformity and cleanliness of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all added elements (limbs, faces, accessories) colored exclusively within the original orange, yellow, red, and brown spectrum, with no unexpected or contrasting hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, all additional elements such as limbs, faces, and accessories adhere to the color scheme of orange, yellow, red, and brown, which harmonizes with the fall theme depicted in the original image. There are no contrasting colors that would disrupt this scheme, which aligns with world knowledge of thematic color usage in autumn-themed illustrations.",

      "question": "Do all anthropomorphized tree characters and their accessories lie completely within the brown rectangular border without extending outside its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added tree characters and accessories appear within the boundaries of the brown rectangular frame. They do not extend beyond it, suggesting a consideration for layout integrity and design symmetry, as recognized by world conventions of maintaining order within illustrated borders.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles placed near the characters without overlapping leaves or limbs, and do they have consistent line thickness and transparent fill matching the illustration’s style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubbles are positioned close to the anthropomorphized leaf characters without directly overlapping any leaves or limbs. The line thickness of the bubbles is consistent, and the fill is transparent, fitting harmoniously with the illustration’s style. This layout reflects good design principles and visual clarity using knowledge of illustration conventions.",
