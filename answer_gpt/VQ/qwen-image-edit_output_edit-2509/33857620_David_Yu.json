      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed roof retain its triangular silhouette with smooth, continuous edges and display detailed icy etchings that appear integrated into the surface rather than overlaid or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof of the structure is no longer triangular, but instead has transformed into a complex, pointed shape with intricate designs. These designs and etchings appear to be part of the surface, suggesting a smooth integration and not as an overlay or fragmented appearance. The smooth edges and integrated etchings fit with the transformation into a fantasy-like architectural style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-covered areas transformed into wing-like forms that exhibit consistent translucency, subtle internal light diffusion, and seamless integration with the surrounding terrain without visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, wings have replaced the snow-covered areas from Image A. These wings exhibit a translucent quality with an internal glow, and the integration with the surrounding terrain appears seamless with no visible seams or unnatural gradients. This analysis is based on the visual presence of light diffusion within the wings, suggesting sophistication in design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the rocky outcrops in the foreground and midground form leg-like structures with anatomically plausible proportions, smooth transitions between segments, and moss textures that match the surrounding environment without appearing pasted or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocky outcrops have been creatively altered into leg-like, clawed structures. These have anatomically plausible proportions with smooth transitions between various segments, similar to twisted or gnarled roots. The moss texture on these structures blends well with the environment, maintaining consistency and avoiding any appearance of being artificially pasted or distorted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stream display a uniform, low-intensity glow along its entire length that follows the natural flow path, without sudden bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent illumination patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stream has been transformed into a luminous flow of energy with a consistent, low-intensity glow throughout its length. The illumination follows the natural path without any abrupt changes in brightness or breaks in continuity, maintaining a coherent visual flow.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fog layer distributed evenly across the upper mountain regions and seamlessly blended with the sky and terrain, preserving depth cues and avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image A does have a fog layer, in Image B, the scene does not focus on fog in the traditional sense as the environment is more mystical and less reliant on such natural cues. There is a consistent ethereal ambiance without demonstrable fog distribution comparable to Image A, making this less applicable.",
