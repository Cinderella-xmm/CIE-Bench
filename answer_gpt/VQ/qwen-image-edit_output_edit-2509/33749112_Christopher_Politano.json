      "question": "Do the mossy fur patterns on the mountain surfaces follow natural growth patterns and blend seamlessly with the existing rock textures without visible seams or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the region with mossy fur patterns is transformed into a fantastical creature with greenery on its surface. This indicates the presence of an imaginative design rather than a natural occurrence. The blending of textures seems well-integrated as it fits the imaginative environment, though it defies natural growth patterns. Analyzing this based on its artistic perspective rather than naturalism, these patterns appear deliberately composed and hence are seamlessly part of the creative design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections in the lake surface consistent with the sky and surrounding landscape, and do the embedded mystical symbols appear sharp, correctly aligned, and free from digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lake surface has been transformed to reflect mystical symbols along with the sky. The symbols appear sharp and aligned with the visual context, indicating careful placement. This reflects an intentional design choice to create a magical effect rather than focusing on natural reflections. Therefore, while the reflections do not depict a realistic landscape reflection, the symbolism is crafted with precision.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the twisted rock horns positioned at the summit peaks in a way that appears anchored to the rock mass, with no floating segments or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the summit peaks are transformed with twisted rock formations resembling horns, emerging from the fantastical creature blended into the mountain landscape. These structures are visually anchored to the rock mass, giving a stable appearance without segments that appear to float or bend at unnatural angles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent veins follow the exact shape of the original pathways without spreading into surrounding areas or creating halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, luminescent veins replace the original pathways, creatively flowing along what were roads or paths and extending into broader areas as part of the fantastical design. These light pathways are not constrained to the original path shape, and they demonstrate an artistic spread across the landscape, occasionally giving off a slight glow which might suggest halo effects.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shimmering scales cover the slopes uniformly without repeating patterns, visible seams, or abrupt transitions from grass to scales?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the slopes have been covered by shimmering scales, forming part of the creature's body. The application of scales appears consistent, without noticeable repeating patterns or abrupt transitions. The scales flow seamlessly from the grassy terrain into the scaled area, demonstrating careful attention to detail in the transition process.",
