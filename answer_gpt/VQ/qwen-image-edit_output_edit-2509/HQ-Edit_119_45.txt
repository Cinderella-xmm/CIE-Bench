    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing the texture of the mechanical components in Image B, we see consistent metallic textures of various hues, specifically brass and copper. These textures are smooth and reflect light effectively, indicating they are intended to portray these metallic surfaces with precision. There is no visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments, suggesting a high-quality integration of materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress appear to maintain their alignment and original spacing, with no visible distortions like bending or stretching. The mechanical parts appear to be integrated well, without disrupting the flow or pattern of the stripes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical wings are placed symmetrically, with both wings having clear edges and defined joints. The emerald accents are integrated into the mechanical structure, appearing solid in their placement and not floating or disconnected, contributing to the overall coherent design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?",
    "explanation": "The clockwork designs on the collar in Image B are clearly defined with gears and mechanical elements that are precisely spaced. The steam exhaust pipes are positioned at plausible angles that make sense within the design, with no overlapping, clipping, or interference with surrounding elements, maintaining an orderly aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "The vapor seen in Image B is softly diffused and gives a natural impression. It is translucent, with gentle blending into the background and no sharp edges or visible pixelation that would suggest digital artifacting. This contributes to the realistic representation of steam.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?",
    "explanation": "The features like eyes, nose, and mouth are not visible or highly blurred, thus not available for evaluation in terms of proportional alignment and anatomical correctness. This question cannot be assessed based on the current visual of Image B.",
    "answer": "Not Applicable"
