      "question": "Do the hummingbird's wings display a seamless, continuous iridescent glass-like texture with natural light reflection and rainbow color gradients, free from jagged edges or artificial-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings of the hummingbird in Image B exhibit a rainbow spectrum, creating an effect similar to iridescence, which is characterized by light reflecting and refracting in a smooth, continuous manner. The wings have a glass-like appearance with soft color transitions across the spectrum. There are no visible jagged edges or harsh patterns observed, suggesting that they possess a fluid surface that naturally interacts with light.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent petals covering the hummingbird’s body arranged in a way that follows the bird’s body contours without gaps, overlaps, or unnatural spacing, and do they exhibit consistent lighting and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, luminescent petals appear to be integrated into the hummingbird’s body. They align with the bird’s contours, maintaining a harmonious pattern that covers the body seamlessly. The petals show a uniform translucency and lighting, indicating a consistent design where lighting effects complement the arrangement without gaps or overlaps.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the crystalline spout seamlessly integrated into the hummingbird’s head, with realistic internal refraction and a coherent, gravity-consistent flow of nectar emerging from its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed hummingbird in Image B shows a crystalline-like spout extending from its head, appearing naturally incorporated into its structure. The nectar’s flow from the spout is oriented downwards, adhering to gravity’s influence. The spout and nectar appear to have a realistic, consistent refraction of light, adhering to optical laws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trailing vines and blossoms extending from the hummingbird’s tail maintain natural growth patterns, with gradual tapering and evenly spaced flowers, and do they avoid appearing stiff or unnaturally rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trailing vines and blossoms extending from the hummingbird’s tail in Image B follow an organic, flowing pattern. They have a gradual tapering effect, with blossoms spaced evenly along the vines. The design avoids stiffness, instead displaying a natural taper and distribution typical of vine growth structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed hummingbird cast a shadow consistent with the ambient lighting direction and intensity, and does its overall appearance harmonize with the surrounding garden elements in terms of color temperature and luminosity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed hummingbird seems to maintain the lighting consistency with the garden scene. Although the shadow details are not explicitly visible, the overall lighting direction matches the ambient light from the background. The bird’s color scheme and luminosity also harmoniously blend with the vibrant and soft tones of the garden, enhancing the cohesive scene.",
