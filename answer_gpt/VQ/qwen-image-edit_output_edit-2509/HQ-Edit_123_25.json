      "question": "Are the floral and scroll motifs on the back of the dress clearly defined with smooth edges and no visible pixelation or broken lines after the paper-cut effect is applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and scroll motifs on the dress are transformed through a paper-cut effect. This effect tends to simplify designs and often leaves motifs with clean, continuous lines resembling cut paper. Observing these areas, the motifs retain their clarity and have smooth edges without signs of pixelation or broken lines, indicating high-quality application of the effect.",

      "question": "Does the blue gradient overlay on the dress transition smoothly without creating abrupt color boundaries or altering the underlying texture of the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dress with an applied blue gradient overlay. Typically, a well-executed gradient will have a seamless transition between colors, without visible bands or abrupt transitions unless intended for artistic effect. The gradient on the dress appears smooth, and the underlying texture remains visible, showing that the transition was handled carefully.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silver tone of the hair accessory uniform and reflective in a way that matches the lighting direction and does not show unnatural highlights or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver hair accessory in Image B should reflect light in a natural manner consistent with its metallic nature. It is uniform in tone, exhibiting reflections that match the lighting on the rest of the subject, with no unnatural highlights or dark patches that would suggest incorrect rendering or editing artifacts.",

      "question": "Do the bamboo patterns in the third postcard align correctly with the background bamboo stalks and maintain consistent spacing and perspective without overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the third postcard of Image B, the bamboo pattern should harmonize with the perspective of the bamboo stalks in the background. This involves matching spacing and avoiding overlaps or floating appearances that would disrupt the scene's realism. The patterns align properly, maintaining natural consistency in perspective.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the silk-bound book have a consistent material texture, proper thickness, and clean edges that match the appearance of a real physical object without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book's depiction in Image B should reflect a tangible object with realistic texture, dimensions, and structural integrity. Its edges are straight and sharp, and the silk-bound material appears consistent in texture. The thickness is proportionate, negating any signs of artificial stretching or warping.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The postcards in Image B need a uniform arrangement within the book layout with equal spacing and complete visibility. The images display margins that appear consistent, and there is no partial cropping or overlap, ensuring a clean and professional presentation.",
