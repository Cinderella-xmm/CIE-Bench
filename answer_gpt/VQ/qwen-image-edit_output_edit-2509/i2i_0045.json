      "question": "Are the girl, stone platform, and frisbee free of unnatural distortions or artifacts, appearing structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl is standing on a stone platform and holding a frisbee. The platform appears geometrically consistent with common paving patterns, and the frisbee is round and maintains its typical shape, indicating no structural distortions in these objects. The girl's figure appears coherent with no anomalies in proportion, suggesting an absence of artifacts or distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass and blue sky background integrate smoothly with the foreground elements, avoiding obvious seams or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a continuous grass field meeting with a clear blue sky. The foreground elements, including the girl and stone platform, flow naturally into this background with no visible seams or transitions, suggesting that the background seamlessly integrates with the foreground. The textures of the grass appear uniform, and the horizon line is smooth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the girl, stone platform, and frisbee adhere to the golden ratio principles in their positioning, creating a balanced and visually credible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden ratio involves dividing a composition into proportions that are aesthetically pleasing. In Image B, the girl is positioned slightly off-center, while the platform provides a stable base, and the frisbee adds dynamic balance. Although not strictly in accordance with the golden ratio, the composition seems balanced and natural through the placement of elements, offering visual credibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details like the texture of the girl's clothing, the surface of the stone platform, and the frisbee preserved clearly without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are well-preserved: the girl's clothing clearly shows patterns and folds, the stone platform depicts defined lines and surfaces characteristic of paving, and the frisbee maintains a clean, solid color. These details suggest that there is no significant degradation in the image quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee match the lighting conditions of the new grass and sky background, avoiding mismatched shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting conditions appear homogeneous. The sunlight seems uniformly applied across the girl, stone platform, and frisbee as well as the background. The shadows, angles, and highlights are consistent across elements, matching the natural outdoor lighting scenario observed in the grassy and sky background.",
