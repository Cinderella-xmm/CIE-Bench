      "question": "Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is transformed into a pop-up style with small figurines standing on its pages. The transformation appears well-executed, with consistent proportions; the pages open up naturally, and the elements within the book are proportional and appropriately placed. There are no visually warped edges or elements that appear to be unnaturally floating, which suggests thoughtful design and structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the quill positioned centrally and vertically as a stable pivot, with natural feather texture and metallic base that match the original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill is positioned vertically in the middle of the open book, acting as a stable pivot. The feather exhibits a natural texture with realistic details, maintaining consistency with the typical texture of feathers. The base is metallic, reflecting the light similarly to how a metallic surface would, matching the materials observed in the scene.",

      "question": "Does the inkwellâ€™s transformation into a fountain include realistic water flow and surface reflections without unnatural highlights or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inkwell has been creatively transformed into a small fountain. The water appears to flow naturally with believable physics, and there are realistic surface reflections on the water. There are no noticeable unnatural highlights or any broken geometry, suggesting a consistent and realistic transformation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the glass cloche transparent and free of distortion, with smooth curvature and accurate light refraction across all internal elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cloche is transparent, with its smooth curvature clearly visible. The light refraction within the cloche is accurately portrayed, with no perceptible distortion of the objects inside. This indicates a high level of realism and attention to detail in the rendering of the glass.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the engraved lines on the wooden base continuous, legible, and integrated with the wood texture without sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base displays engraved lines that are continuous and legible. These engravings are well integrated with the wood texture, with no sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations, maintaining both aesthetic and structural coherence.",
