    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the mountain shapes are represented with sharp, clear geometric forms. The edges are clean and consistent, emphasizing simplicity and stylization. Common visual patterns in artwork that focus on geometric simplicity feature consistent shapes that maintain their structural integrity across the image. In comparison to Image A, which provides detailed textures and natural lines, Image B opts for a stylistic approach that emphasizes straight lines and angles, maintaining the structural consistency of geometric forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees present geometric silhouettes with consistent proportions and smooth outlines. They are stylized into triangular shapes, avoiding any fragmented or irregular edges, which are common in vector-based or graphic design art styles. Compared to the detailed texture and natural silhouettes found in Image A, Image B uses standard shapes to suggest the presence of trees while emphasizing their geometric consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows radiating parallel lines in the river that align with the direction in which the river flows, creating a sense of perspective and uniformity. They are spaced out uniformly, creating a visual rhythm commonly seen in abstract or stylized artwork. This approach to design enhances visual continuity and perspective, distinct from the natural, uninterrupted flow of the river depicted in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays reflections in the river that are symmetrical to the elements above it. The trees and mountains appear to mirror into the river flawlessly with matching shapes and positions, a technique often used in stylized or vector art to create harmony and balance. Image A, in contrast, provides reflections that are more natural and less rigidly aligned. The symmetry in Image B is deliberate and reflects cohesive design principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B features color blocks with boundaries that are distinct and crisp. The edges of geometric shapes are sharp, without signs of blurring, feathering, or pixelation, typically characteristic of vector or digital graphic art. Such sharpness ensures clarity in visual elements and maintains a clean aesthetic. This differs from Image A's more naturally blended and textured approach, where colors are less rigid in their boundaries.",
    "answer": "Yes"
