    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel joints clearly defined, aligned with the frame's geometry, and rendered with consistent metallic texture and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel joints are a crucial part of the mechanical design of the insect-like bicycle. They appear clearly defined, with precise outlines that align with the frame's geometry. The texture and shading are consistent with a metallic finish, demonstrating an appropriate light reflection and shadow casting that is typical for metal. This level of detail and alignment enhances the overall mechanical aesthetic, integrating seamlessly with the rest of the design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carapace-shaped seat have detailed surface textures, proper curvature, and seamless attachment to the seat post without visible seams or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carapace-shaped seat in Image B possesses detailed textures that simulate a metallic, armored appearance. The curvature is smooth and natural, resembling the natural shape of an insect's carapace while maintaining a robust look suited for mechanical design. Its attachment to the seat post is seamless, without any visible seams or warping, indicating high quality and attention to detail in the rendering process.",

      "question": "Do the mechanical legs have realistic hinge mechanisms, correct proportions, and no overlapping or misplaced segments that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical legs in Image B are designed with realistic hinge mechanisms, showing articulated joints that allow for plausible movement and bending. The proportions of these legs align correctly with the rest of the bike-insect hybrid, ensuring that the segments do not overlap or appear misplaced, which would break the spatial logic. This attention to design preserves the coherence and believability of the mechanized creature.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wingtips smoothly attached to the top tube, showing consistent copper coloring, reflective properties, and no jagged edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wingtips are smoothly attached to the top tube of the bicycle structure. They display a consistent copper color with reflective properties typical of a metallic surface. There are no jagged edges or noticeable texture repetition, contributing to a polished and harmonious integration into the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock faces clearly visible, properly embedded in the handlebars, and free from texture artifacts, incorrect lighting, or distorted numerals/runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock faces in Image B are clearly visible and properly embedded into the handlebars of the mechanical bicycle. They lack any texture artifacts or issues with lighting, which can distort details in digital content. The numerals and runes on the clock faces are presented without distortion, ensuring that they contribute effectively to the steampunk aesthetic of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all newly added mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) share consistent material properties, such as metallic sheen, color tone, and surface imperfections, without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All the newly added mechanical elements in Image B, including the legs, joints, wings, and clocks, share consistent material properties. They exhibit a uniform metallic sheen and color tone that ties them together visually. There are no abrupt visual breaks or inconsistencies, such as mismatched colors or textures, which ensures a cohesive appearance for the entire modified image.",
