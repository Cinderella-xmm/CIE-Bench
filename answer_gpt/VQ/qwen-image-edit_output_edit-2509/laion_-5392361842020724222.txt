    "Question": "Q2: Is the velvet texture on the standing figure's cloak rendered with natural depth, soft shading, and smooth transitions between folds without abrupt edges or unnatural compression?",
    "explanation": "Velvet is a fabric known for its soft, thick pile and rich texture. Based on the Image B observation, the standing figure's cloak exhibits characteristics of rich velvet with smooth transitions between folds and depth that aligns with the softness typical of velvet. There are no abrupt edges or signs of compression that would be inconsistent with the portrayal of velvet. This observation leads to a conclusion of rendered natural depth and shading in the cloak.",
