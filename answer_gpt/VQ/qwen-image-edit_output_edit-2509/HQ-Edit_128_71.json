      "question": "Does the scaled-down Statue of Liberty retain correct proportions between its head, torso, arms, and legs without any visible stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scaled-down Statue of Liberty within the glass lantern appears to maintain the correct proportions between its head, torso, arms, and legs. The visual cues suggest that the miniature representation honors the original design's proportions, displaying consistency without signs of stretching or compression.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green and copper hues on the statue’s surface distributed naturally with variations in tone and texture resembling real patina formation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green and copper hues on the statue's surface in Image B are delicately distributed, suggesting a texture and tone variation consistent with natural patina formation. This effect mimics the weathered appearance of the original Statue of Liberty, where time and weather contribute to such color variations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass lantern transparent with visible reflections and refractions, and do its edges appear smooth without jagged lines or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass lantern in Image B shows transparency with noticeable reflections and refractions, indicative of a realistic glass surface. Additionally, the edges appear smooth, with no visible jagged lines or digital artifacts, suggesting high rendering quality.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastel skyline in Image B features smooth color gradients and softly defined silhouettes of the buildings. There are no abrupt color changes or banding visible, which allows for a gentle transition of colors, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the background.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ships and waves beneath the statue appropriately sized relative to the statue and do they exhibit natural shapes and wave patterns without repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ships and waves in Image B are appropriately scaled relative to the statue, maintaining a coherent proportion. The shapes and wave patterns appear natural, without noticeable repetition or distortion, ensuring a realistic diorama effect within the lantern.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the revolving mechanism at the base integrated seamlessly with the lantern’s structure, with all components properly aligned and grounded without floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The revolving mechanism at the base of the glass lantern in Image B appears to be seamlessly integrated. The components exhibit proper alignment and are grounded, without any parts floating or misaligned. This contributes to the structural integrity and realism of the depicted object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all elements in the scene—including the statue, glass lantern, ships, and waves—cast shadows consistent with a single light source and show uniform lighting without conflicting highlights or dark spots?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements such as the statue, glass lantern, ships, and waves seem to cast shadows that are consistent with a single light source. The lighting across the scene appears uniform, with no evidence of conflicting highlights or dark spots that would suggest multiple light sources or irregular lighting.",
