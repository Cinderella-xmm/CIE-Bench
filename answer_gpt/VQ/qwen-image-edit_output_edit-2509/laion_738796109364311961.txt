    "Question": "Q1: Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
    "explanation": "The player in red (player #24) shows muscular definition that appears emphasized. Common visual effects focusing on athletic depiction can involve enhancing muscle tones. The muscles are shown with clear definition on his arms and legs, but they are consistent with an athletic build. There aren't visible distortions or unnatural bulging that would suggest an unrealistic or exaggerated form. The anatomy remains plausible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
    "explanation": "Both players' uniforms appear vibrant in color but keep a natural gradient and texture visible, suggesting the material context such as fabric wrinkles and shine. Commonly, edited images increase vibrancy while preserving these traits to maintain realism, and in this image, the uniforms do not appear oversaturated or lose their texture details to appear flat.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
    "explanation": "The background comprises the crowd and field, appearing consistent and coherent with the foreground action. Stylistic enhancement often intends to make the scene more vivid while preserving detail for realism.

    "Question": "Q5: Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
    "explanation": "The players' limbs and body postures are depicted in a manner consistent with real-world athletic motion. Despite showing vigorous activity that could exaggerate certain features, the biomechanics are maintained with no indication of broken joints or limbs appearing unattached from their bodies.",
