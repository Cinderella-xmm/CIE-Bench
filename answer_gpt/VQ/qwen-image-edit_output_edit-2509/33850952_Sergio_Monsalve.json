    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tentacle-like extensions are visually integrated into the curves of the facade. They follow the flowing design pattern without exhibiting abrupt angles or abrupt disconnections. The smooth integration can be concluded from the consistent curvature and alignment with the main structure. Common knowledge about natural and architectural integration supports the observation of fluid continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fibrous textures in Image B visually follow the curvature of the facade. They appear continuous and organically woven into the design by smoothly conforming to the curves. The absence of repeating patterns or jagged edges highlights a natural flow aligning with architectural design principles of continuity and seamless integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts window areas that are seemingly replaced with translucent membranes. These membranes allow for soft light transmission, as evidenced by the glow, lacking defined borders or visible seams. The knowledge that membranes can diffuse light supports the observation that they integrate seamlessly with the facade without disruption.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the iridescent scale patterns align smoothly with the facade's curvature. The visual display of color transitions appears fluid, without any flat or distorted regions interrupting the pattern. The concept of iridescent materials exhibiting gradual color changes with varying angles underscores the seamless integration seen here.",
      "weight": 1,

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bio-luminescent lines in Image B emit a soft, uneven glow that naturally fades at the edges. They interact with the nearby surfaces, contributing to the dramatic, integrated lighting effects. Common knowledge about lighting and surface interaction supports the observation of a soft glow without harsh boundaries.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various modified elements such as tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines appear properly anchored to the building structure. They do not show signs of floating or overlapping incorrectly, suggesting a cohesive integration with the existing architectural design, which reflects principles of secure and logical attachment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict traditional balcony railings, interior furniture, or planters visible beneath the new textures and lighting effects. They are transformed and replaced by the futuristic and organic design elements, indicating a shift in focus away from traditional architectural features.",
