      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shape of the tiles that represent the sausages is analyzed. The sausages are elongated and slightly curved in shape. The use of tessellated tiles mimics this curvature but can result in minor geometric distortions due to the nature of broken tiles. However, based on the pattern, the overall elongated and curved form is preserved without significant unnatural straightening. Thus, the conclusion is that the shape is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the green-tiled areas in Image B, the tiles are arranged in a way that captures the ruffled and layered appearance of lettuce leaves. The tiles' edges appear irregular and vary in size to reflect the natural variation of leaves, avoiding uniform or blocky alignment. This suggests that the natural structure is mimicked accurately.",

      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the formation of the egg is examined. The tessellated layout of the egg maintains a mostly circular appearance, and there is a clearly defined center orange-yellow section representing the yolk. However, tile patterns can introduce slight deviations. Despite this, the overall proportions and orientation remain consistent with a traditional depiction, confirming that the egg in Image B closely matches the described conditions.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a mosaic pattern that reflects a symmetrical design. The elements are arranged in a notably balanced manner around the central point, which is typical in such artistic renditions. While perfect symmetry is a challenge with mosaic art due to tile shapes, the placement follows a visually balanced organization. Each section appears proportionate and evenly spaced relative to one another.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, it's observed that the glass tiles generally have well-defined edges typical of mosaics, showing personalized shapes and necessary subtle reflections contributing to the artistic style. The color shading is consistent, although naturally varied to maintain visual interest. Considering the medium, artifacts like blurring or jagged lines are minimal, affirming uniformity in the tile presentation.",
