    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass-like surface of the transformed Eiffel Tower show natural transparency and subtle reflections consistent with real glass under overcast lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts an Eiffel Tower transformed into a glass bottle. The surface appears transparent, as it reveals both the external scenery and the design inside the bottle. The reflection and transparency seem realistic under an overcast sky, which typically diffuses light, creating soft and subtle highlights without sharp reflections. Therefore, the transparency and reflections match expectations for glass under such lighting conditions.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed patterns on the glass surface aligned with the original lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower and proportionally consistent across all levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass bottle features a design inspired by the Eiffel Tower, but it does not attempt to replicate the intricate lattice structure of the actual tower. Instead, the design appears simplified and embossed for decorative purposes. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it does not fully mirror the original structure's complexity or proportions exactly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold-plated base positioned correctly at the bottom of the tower, with smooth edges and consistent metallic texture that matches the scale and lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the bottle is gold-plated and situated correctly at the bottom, anchoring the bottle to the scene. The edges appear smooth and polished, with a consistent metallic texture. Given the overcast lighting and its position relative to the glass surface, it matches the scene's scale and lighting well, without distracting or appearing out of place.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Parisian skyline motif visible along the glass surface without distorting the towerâ€™s shape or appearing as a floating or disconnected element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass features a Parisian skyline motif, visible inside the bottle, designed to complement the Eiffel Tower motif. Despite its presence, the skyline does not cause distortion or appear disconnected because it fits into the transparent design of the bottle. It is well-incorporated without floating or appearing anomalous.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the logo at the neck of the bottle clearly defined, centered, and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo on the neck of the bottle is small yet distinctly visible, placed centrally. It is well-delineated and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts, maintaining clarity and quality against the transparency of the glass, which highlights its smooth definition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main structural elements of the tower (legs, arches, central column) preserved in correct proportion and alignment, with no signs of stretching or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays a transformation from the Eiffel Tower to a glass bottle with decorative accents. In this artistic context, while it visually references the structural elements, such as the overall shape inspired by the tower, it inherently lacks the precise proportionality and alignment of the real tower due to its altered form as a bottle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the image of the glass bottle closely, there are no visible signs of pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections. The transition from the Eiffel Tower to a glass bottle has been executed smoothly, with attention to detail that avoids such digital artifacts.",
