    "Question": "Q1: Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seat cushion is designed to mimic LEGO bricks, which are typically characterized by uniform size and shape. The cushion surface is composed of these LEGO bricks, presenting a consistent black color. There are no gradients present, as LEGO bricks are solid colored without such transitions. The nature of LEGO bricks naturally results in clean, defined surfaces without texture artifacts, emphasizing uniformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backrest is crafted using LEGO bricks which create layers that appear to be evenly spaced and aligned horizontally. These bricks follow the conventional design, lacking gaps or misalignments. The use of LEGO bricks ensures a uniform and precise assembly, maintaining the intended contour of the backrest effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the armrests appear to be constructed from LEGO pieces with clean edges, typical of LEGO design. However, they do not have a silver finish but rather appear in gray or black, consistent with common LEGO colors. The armrests are LEGO-like in design rather than curvilinear, indicating they may not fully preserve the original curvature seen in Image A, but maintain a structured, brick-like formation.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are crafted to resemble LEGO wheels, typically made of translucent material with a visible internal structure. They retain consistent size and placement, which aligns with the precise and structured assembly characteristic of LEGO constructions. The use of uniform materials also maintains design consistency across all five wheels.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the chair stands on a flat surface that appears to be light gray rather than white, similar to the surface in Image A. There are no obvious inconsistencies in shadows or depth that would suggest misalignment. The surface supports the chair as expected, with a subtle shadow consistent with the lighting of the environment.",
    "answer": "No"
