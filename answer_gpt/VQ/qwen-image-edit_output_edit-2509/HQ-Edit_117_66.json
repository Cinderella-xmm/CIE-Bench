      "question": "Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jigsaw puzzle pieces are designed with interlocking edges, typical of real-life jigsaw pieces that fit neatly together. There is no visible gap, overlap, or deformation between interconnected pieces, suggesting a seamless interlock. This reflects a high level of precision common in crafted puzzles, allowing the pieces to fit together smoothly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the dragon patterns use a darker wood stain, contrasting with the lighter stain of the compass area. The transitions between these regions are smooth and natural, implying a well-designed gradient or staining technique typical in quality woodworking. This use of color differentiation and smooth transition in wood stain enhances the visual distinction between different elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wood grain texture clearly on each puzzle piece, providing a unique and varied pattern typical of real wood. There are no signs of repeating patterns or artificial smoothing, which can often occur in edited images. This variety in texture contributes to the natural and authentic appearance of the wooden puzzle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces around the main puzzle area are scattered in a randomized manner, resting flat on the wooden surface. None of the pieces appear to float or overlap unrealistically, maintaining a perspective consistent with physical laws. This realistic scattering enhances the authentic look of an in-progress puzzle assembly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central compass in Image B maintains a perfect circular shape with precise and detailed engraved lines and divisions. There is no visible distortion or reduction in clarity, which is indicative of high-quality craftsmanship or detailed editing often associated with fine woodworking or intricately designed jigsaw puzzles.",
