      "question": "Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black and blue brick textures that form the body panels are assembled in a Lego format which relies on flat surfaces and angular constructs, typical characteristics of Lego designs. These panels are made up of individual Lego pieces which inherently align geometrically since Lego bricks are designed to seamlessly fit together. The panels in Image B maintain a consistent angular design enhanced by the precise assembly of bricks. By examining the sharp lines and continuity, and knowing that Lego construction inherently supports geometric consistency, there is clear alignment and consistency in the design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle's rims have distinct cog-like patterns and appear to maintain a circular design, consistent with the proportional dimensions of Lego constructions. The visual cues show evenly spaced 'teeth' in these rims, which are consistent with the Lego theme of uniformity and precision engineering. There is no indication of distortion, stretching, or breakage. Knowing how Lego pieces are manufactured to precision, it's evident the rims appear consistent with the design requirements.",

      "question": "Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays colorful decals applied onto the different surfaces of the motorcycle assembled from Lego pieces. These stickers appear flush against the surfaces, fitting within the flat profiles of Lego bricks without leaving gaps or causing overlapping. The clean appearance and precision involved in sticker application with Lego imply seamless integration. This aligns with the expectation that decals are designed to match the tile areas on Lego bricks without any unnatural effects.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycleâ€™s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gray baseplate on which the motorcycle is mounted appears flat and continuous. The visual evidence shows the motorcycle standing securely, matched to the flat surface of the base without any discrepancies in elevation. Lego baseplates offer a stable, flat foundation designed to support constructions, and the bike sits as expected in a properly-supported position, indicating no visible distortion or mismatch.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a display case enclosing the Lego motorcycle, composed of clear plastic-like material. The borders of the case are visually coherent without any disturbance to the perception of the motorcycle inside. There's no ghosting, refraction errors, or shadow effects interfering with the view of the bike, which is typical of high-quality, transparent display materials used for Lego models designed for clear viewing.",
