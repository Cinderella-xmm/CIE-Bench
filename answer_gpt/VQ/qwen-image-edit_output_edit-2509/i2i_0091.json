      "question": "Does the integration of the castle hall elements into the room visually align with the existing lighting and shadows, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows in the castle hall appear natural and coherent. The light source, coming from the window on the right side, casts shadows in the expected direction, aligning with how light would naturally stream into such a space. The consistent shadow patterns on the floor and walls suggest an alignment with the original lighting setup of the environment, reducing the likelihood of unnatural artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the newly added castle hall elements, like stone and metal, depicted naturally and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the stone walls and metal sconces in Image B appears natural. The stone has a textured, realistic appearance with appropriate shading that suggests depth and material characteristics typical of stone. The sconces have a metallic shine that reflects light as expected. There are no visible distortions or artifacts that would suggest an unnatural rendering of these materials.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the books, vases, and plants remained undistorted and preserved their original details post-editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B does not feature the books, vases, and plants from Image A, we cannot assess any distortion or preservation of original details. The focus is purely on the integration of castle hall elements, making this question not applicable.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the introduction of the castle hall maintain the room's spatial rationality, keeping the proportions and placements of objects consistent with expectations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited castle hall in Image B maintains spatial rationality through its architectural design, proportions, and scale. The vaulted ceiling, arched windows, and door are consistent with typical castle hall dimensions, providing a coherent sense of space that aligns with expectations for such structures. The overall arrangement complements the existing room proportionally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting effects in the edited castle hall scene match the light source and style of the original room, ensuring continuity in illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effects in the castle hall are consistent with the existing light source from the windows, with the light casting appropriately through the room onto the floor, showing continuity in illumination. The shadows and highlights align with the direction and quality expected from a natural window light source, ensuring a seamless blend in lighting style.",
