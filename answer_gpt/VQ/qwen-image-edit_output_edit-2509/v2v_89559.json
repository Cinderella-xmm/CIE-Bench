      "question": "Do the 'Search for a Star' and 'Rising Star' logos appear as coherent golden statuettes without any unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the two golden statuettes at the top of the composition. Analyzing their structure and texture, they appear smooth and well-defined without any distortion or unnatural textures. The statuettes themselves do not show logos but rather represent decorative figures that are common in award imagery, thus maintaining coherence. Comparing with Image A, which contains cartoonish logos, Image B replaces these with classic statuette figures for a formal and prestigious aesthetic. Hence, the statuettes are complete and natural in appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dark velvet curtain background complement the golden statuettes without introducing any unnatural lighting effects or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a dark velvet curtain which is typically used to impart a luxurious and formal atmosphere. It complements the shiny golden statuettes by providing a rich contrast, thereby enhancing their prominence. The texture and lighting on the curtain appear consistent and natural without any strange highlights or textures that would detract from the overall visual harmony. Therefore, the curtain effectively complements the statuettes.",

      "question": "Does the 'Sumo Digital' logo appear as a naturally embossed seal on a polished wooden plaque without any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Sumo Digital' logo is part of a circular silver seal that appears to be embossed onto the plaque. The seal has a metallic sheen, emulating the look of engraved awards, which fits the thematic design of the overall image. The details of the logo are clear and well-defined, with the textures appearing smooth and intentional. When compared to the original in Image A, which positions the logo within a more graphic context, the transformation is successful and maintains detail and legibility.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Character Art Directory 2018' is presented in a beveled style that mimics engraved metal. It maintains a consistent silver appearance, which aligns with the sophisticated theme of the image. The text is clear and legible without any distortion, ensuring readability. This contrasts with the flat, straightforward text presentation in Image A. The engraved style enhances the formal aesthetic successfully.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the edited image maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without any obvious artifacts or unnatural transitions between elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B as a whole maintains a structured and visually credible composition.

This indicates a well-executed image with attention to visual consistency.",
