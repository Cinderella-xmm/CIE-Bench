    "Question": "Q1: Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the original architectural archways have been edited to form parts of the golem figure, such as limbs. While these parts maintain a semblance of an arch shape, they do not have natural joint-like transitions that resemble articulated limbs. The limbs are structured with harsh geometrical breaks to enhance the robotic or stone-like nature of the golem, rather than smoothly mimicking biological joints.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B has glowing glyphs that cover the surface of the edited golem structure. These glyphs appear smoothly distributed without jagged edges or pixelation that would indicate digital artifacts. They enhance the mystical aspect of the golem without disrupting the perceived integrity of the stone surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a mystical aura surrounding the golem figure. This aura transitions smoothly from the shadowed areas, providing a continuous gradation into the bright elements. There are no sudden discontinuities or floating light effects that seem misplaced or ungrounded, preserving a sense of unity in the visual composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous guide wisp appears in the same position as the original figure and dog in Image A. It retains its spatial alignment while exhibiting a wispy, translucent texture that does not feature solid edges or anatomical characteristics, enhancing its ethereal presence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
    "explanation": "Image B successfully maintains the perceptual layering of the elements. The golem stands within the scene, respecting the depth relationships and ensuring that the foreground, midground, and background elements are correctly aligned. The figure does not appear to be floating above or behind the established spatial framework.",
    "answer": "Yes"
