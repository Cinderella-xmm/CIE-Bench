      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed topiary structures maintain smooth, continuous surfaces and natural-looking textures without visible distortion or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases topiary structures that resemble trees wrapped in spiral vines. From the visual cues, the surfaces of these topiaries appear smooth, consistent, and well-integrated, demonstrating a natural texture that suggests a stylized approach. There are no visual distortions or pixelations observed, which suggests that the transformation maintains quality and believability within the scene.",

      "question": "Does the water in the fountain exhibit consistent transparency and refraction effects, with no unnatural streaks or broken flow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fountain in Image B displays water flowing over crystalline structures, maintaining consistent transparency and refraction effects. The flow of the water appears smooth, and the interaction with light is consistent with natural water properties, showcasing a continuous stream without breaks or unnatural streak patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spiral vine paths seamlessly integrated into the garden landscape, with gradual transitions and no sudden breaks or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spiral vine paths in Image B are designed to wrap around the topiary structures with a clear progression from one point to another, maintaining a continuous integration into the garden landscape. The visual cues suggest a seamless and logical attachment, with no visible breaks or interruptions in their path.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly-like creatures positioned at varying depths in the scene, with appropriate size scaling and soft edges that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features butterfly-like creatures dispersed throughout the scene, showing different depths with varying sizes that give a sense of perspective. The edges of these creatures are soft, complementing the ambient lighting and overall ethereal nature of the scene, supporting a smooth integration into the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floral crowns positioned at the tops of the topiary structures with natural attachment points and no floating or misaligned petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral crowns in Image B atop the topiary structures are visually well-integrated, exhibiting natural attachment to the topiaries without signs of misalignment or floating. The petals are aligned logically with the structure's contour, adding to the harmonious integration within the scene.",
