    "Question": "Q1: Are the brushed metal and matte finishes applied consistently across the robot’s body without visible texture artifacts or inconsistent sheen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's texture is represented with a consistent application of brushed metal and matte finishes across its body. The surface sheen is even and there are no visible texture artifacts, indicating a high-quality rendering. This consistency implies careful attention to detail in texturing work, which is crucial for achieving a realistic look.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces clear and non-blurry, and do the joint areas (elbows, knees) show no signs of geometric distortion or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved details on the robot's armor and weapon surfaces are sharp and clear, indicating high-quality modeling work. The joint areas, such as elbows and knees, are fully intact with no geometrical distortion or missing segments, suggesting a thoughtful design process to maintain integrity in these areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces correctly aligned and positioned without overlapping or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's limbs, weapons, and armor pieces are correctly aligned and well-positioned. There are no overlapping or floating elements, which indicates that careful attention was given to the spatial arrangement to avoid any visual inconsistencies or spatial logic violations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
