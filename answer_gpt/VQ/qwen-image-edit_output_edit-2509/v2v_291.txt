    "Question": "Q1: Do the hippo and rabbit maintain their natural proportions and structural consistency in the 3D cartoon design without any visible distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo and rabbit appear in a cartoonish 3D design. Typically, such designs may exaggerate certain features for stylistic purposes. Upon checking, both animals maintain recognizable features relevant to their species—such as the hippo's robust body and the rabbit's furry texture—indicating that while cartoonish, the proportions are consistent with common depictions. Comparison with Image A shows a transition from realistic to stylized, but the consistency in proportions remains recognizable and unexaggerated.",
