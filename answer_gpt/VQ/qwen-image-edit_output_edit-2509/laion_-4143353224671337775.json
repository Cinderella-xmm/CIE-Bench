    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are precisely aligned and fit together perfectly across the surface of the sculpture. The image shows no visible gaps or misalignments between the pieces. They appear uniformly interlocked, demonstrating a smooth and consistent design. This even and seamless appearance suggests a meticulous arrangement of puzzle pieces without jagged edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts puzzle pieces that conform well to the sculpture's round form. The edges of the pieces in the edited image are designed to match the natural curvature of the sculpture without introducing abrupt angular deviations or flattening. The puzzle pieces have gentle curves that fit the spherical shape, maintaining a harmonious integration with the object's form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green puzzle fragment appears smooth and consistent in texture. It shows no signs of roughness, cracks, or varied coloring. The surface of the green section integrates smoothly with the beige and brown pieces, matching their texture and uniformity without any distracting contrasts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture rests directly on the flat white shelf surface. The shadow is consistent and suggests stable contact. It does not appear to float or tilt, maintaining a normal perspective that indicates solid placement. The shadow accurately reflects the sculpture's position relative to the shelf.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From the visual cues provided in Image B, the puzzle piece design does not explicitly display facial features such as eyes, mouth, or ears due to the edited nature of the image, and thus this question is beyond the scope of possibility.",
