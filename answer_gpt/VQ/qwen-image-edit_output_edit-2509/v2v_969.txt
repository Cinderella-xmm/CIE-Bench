    "Question": "Q1: Do the chibi-style 3D figures inside the snow globe maintain the correct proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "The chibi-style figures inside the snow globe in Image B are stylized to have exaggerated features typical of chibi designs, such as larger heads and smaller bodies, which are deliberate and common in such representations. Despite the exaggeration, there are no unnatural geometric distortions, as the figures consistently follow the expected aesthetic of chibi art. This style is maintained without stretching or skewing the figures in unexpected ways, indicating correct proportions within the intended art style.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow on the grass appears light and evenly distributed, akin to how snow might lightly dust a grassy field. There are no visible pixelation, rough edges, or pattern repetition that would indicate the presence of artifacts or unnatural textures. The snow layer blends well with the surrounding elements, maintaining a natural and realistic look consistent with what one might expect within a snow globe.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the snow globe rest naturally on the rustic wooden shelf with soft sunlight filtering through, creating believable warm, golden reflections?",
    "explanation": "Visual cues from Image B show a snow globe positioned on a wooden shelf with sunlight casting warm, golden reflections. The lighting is soft and consistent with late afternoon or early morning light, which typically casts longer shadows and has a warm tone. The reflections and shadows on the glossy surface of the snow globe enhance its three-dimensionality and integrate it well with its surroundings, making it appear naturally placed on the shelf.",
