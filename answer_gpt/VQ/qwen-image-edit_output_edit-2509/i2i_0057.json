      "question": "Does the biomechanical horse robot maintain the same posture and appear structurally consistent with the cow's original position and stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess the posture and structural consistency of the biomechanical horse robot in Image B, I observe its position and posture first. The horse robot is grazing, with its neck positioned downward, which differs from the cow's standing or walking pose in Image A. The orientation and position of both entities are different; hence, they are not structurally consistent with each other.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the biomechanical horse robot, specifically the silver-white metallic shell and exposed joint mechanisms, seamlessly integrated into the rural setting without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biomechanical horse exhibits a silver-white metallic shell and visible joint mechanisms, which starkly contrast with the natural rural surroundings of grass, trees, and dirt road. These elements are man-made and futuristic and therefore appear out of place against the natural setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the textures of the biomechanical horse robot, including the metallic shell and joints, appear natural and detailed without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic shell and joint configurations of the biomechanical horse are visually detailed and well-defined. The textures are consistently rendered, and no unnatural artifacts are evident within the mechanisms themselves, thus appearing natural and detailed within the context of their design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical characteristics of the biomechanical horse robot, like its size relative to the road and grass, realistic and logically consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biomechanical horse's dimensions and size are consistent with the surrounding elements, such as the road and grass. The horse appears to be of realistic size within the context of these elements, and its physical characteristics logically align with the perspective and scale implied by the overall scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the biomechanical horse robot preserve the visual plausibility of the scene, meaning does it not disrupt the natural appearance and flow of the road, grass, and trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the size and scale of the biomechanical horse in Image B are consistent with the environment, its futuristic design and metallic texture introduce an element that disrupts the natural aesthetic of the rural scene. As such, the overall visual plausibility of the scene is affected by the horse's design, which is incongruent with the surrounding natural elements.",
