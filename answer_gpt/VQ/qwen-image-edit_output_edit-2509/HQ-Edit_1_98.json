      "question": "Does the floral engraving on the dress appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric without visible texture breaks, misaligned patterns, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features an intricate floral design, with the pattern appearing to cover the entire fabric. Visually, the floral pattern seems to follow the natural drape and movement of the dress without any visible misalignments or breaks in texture, which indicates a seamless integration. The use of consistent shading and highlights gives the appearance of the floral pattern being part of the fabric rather than an overlay. This seamlessness suggests careful attention to detail in ensuring the pattern flows naturally with the dress's form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sepia tones applied uniformly across all elements (including skin, dress, violin, window frame, and plants) without localized color distortions or loss of detail in shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered in a sepia tone, which is applied consistently across various elements such as the dress, violin, skin, window frame, and plants. Upon examining these components, they all exhibit a similar hue of sepia with no evident anomalies in color application. Shadow and highlight details are preserved, suggesting that the sepia tone maintains the image's depth and texture without any areas appearing disproportionately dark or washed out.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the abstract swirls in the window view remain confined within the window panes and align correctly with their borders, without overlapping into the room or distorting the window structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window features abstract swirl designs within the panes. Observing these decorations, they appear neatly contained within the borders of the window panes. There are no overlaps into the room's interior, and the window's structural lines remain intact, with no warping or distortion caused by the design. This indicates that the swirls are properly aligned and integrated into the window scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gold inlays on the violin positioned along logical contours of the instrument and do they exhibit consistent metallic sheen and reflection without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The violin in Image B is adorned with gold inlays. These decorations are positioned logically along the instrument's curves and edges, complementing its shape. The gold inlays show a consistent metallic sheen, reflecting light in a way that suggests a coherent three-dimensional form. This indicates that the inlays are well-integrated with the violin's design and do not appear to float or detach unnaturally from the instrument.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the handwritten music score border evenly spaced, legible, and aligned along the image edge without intersecting or obscuring any part of the violinist, window, or foreground objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a handwritten music score serves as a border. The text is arranged evenly around the image, maintaining a consistent distance from the edges. It does not intersect with or obscure any primary elements such as the violinist, window, or surrounding objects. The legibility of the text is preserved throughout, ensuring that it complements rather than detracts from the central scene within the image.",
