      "question": "Does the snowy tundra landscape appear naturally integrated with the Leaning Tower of Pisa without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy tundra landscape covers the ground surrounding the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The editing is seamless, with no visible edges or mismatched textures where the tower meets the snowy background. The horizon of snow aligns naturally, suggesting a plausible extension of the landscape behind and beside the tower, giving the impression that the scene is natural and consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the snowy tundra landscape consistent with the natural appearance of the original image, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowy tundra in Image B has a uniform texture typical of snow-covered landscapes, devoid of any visible artifacts or inconsistencies. The consistency in color grading and shading across the snowy expanse suggests that the textures are applied realistically, maintaining a cohesive look without artificial anomalies.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the Leaning Tower of Pisa maintain its structural coherence and proportions against the new snowy tundra background, without any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Leaning Tower of Pisa retains its original shape, architectural features, and proportions. The angle and scale of the tower do not appear distorted or misaligned despite the change in background, implying that the structural integrity is preserved and coherent against the snowy backdrop.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa been preserved, and does the snowy tundra background lack any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows the architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, such as the arches and columns, which remain distinct and undistorted. The snowy tundra environment complements this clarity, without introducing any distractions or loss of detail, suggesting a well-executed integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the elements of the snowy tundra landscape, such as snow-covered ground and trees, appear physically plausible and proportionate relative to the size of the Leaning Tower of Pisa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements such as the snow-covered ground and the trees are in alignment with the scale of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The snow appears evenly distributed without disproportion, and the tree sizes complement the scale of the tower, maintaining proportionate realism within the scene.",
