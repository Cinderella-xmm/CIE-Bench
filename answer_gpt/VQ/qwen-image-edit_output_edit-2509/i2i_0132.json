      "question": "Do the hands and arms of both individuals maintain natural proportions and shapes without appearing distorted or having unnatural numbers of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals' hands and arms appear properly proportioned and balanced with their bodies. The arms are extended naturally towards the frisbee, an action that indicates a reaching or catching motion. The hands do not look distorted and have an appropriate number of fingers suitable for a realistic human appearance. This natural positioning and shape are typical for people engaging in outdoor activities like playing frisbee.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the characters' clothes and the grass field preserved naturally without losing detail or creating unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the clothes on the characters appear smooth and even, resembling the texture of basic cotton T-shirts and denim pants. The grass field has a consistent color with varying shades that reflect light realistically, avoiding repetitive patterns. The attention to texture provides a coherent and realistic portrayal of a sunny day in a park.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image accurately reflect the original sunlight direction, maintaining shadow and highlight placements in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B follows a consistent light source from the top right, highlighting the frisbee and creating shadows on the ground that correspond with the positioning of the light. The shadows cast by the characters and trees align with the light direction, maintaining a natural look and supporting a sunny day atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the positioning and trajectory of the frisbee in mid-air consistent with realistic motion, avoiding any apparent physical inaccuracies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frisbee is illustrated in a mid-air position between the two characters, suggesting it is in the process of being tossed or caught. The position seems logical, given the arm and hand placements of the individuals reaching towards it. This scene supports the natural mechanics of playing frisbee in an open field.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions and body postures of the characters align naturally with their dynamic poses and the context of playing frisbee, without any exaggerated or inconsistent distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are portrayed in active poses, with bodies slightly bent forward as if anticipating catching or throwing the frisbee. The tilts and angles of their bodies and limbs fit into the dynamic action of playing frisbee. There is no exaggeration in limb extension or distortion which would conflict with the physical activity depicted.",
