    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the spaceship retain a coherent circular shape with consistent proportions, and are the added circular motifs and meander patterns aligned symmetrically without warping or overlapping irregularly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the object akin to a spaceship is transformed into a vase with painted patterns. The vase retains a coherent circular shape reminiscent of classical pottery, with symmetrical proportions and evenly aligned circular motifs and meander patterns. The patterns do not show any signs of warping or irregular overlapping, maintaining a consistent and regular design as would be expected in high-quality pottery craftsmanship. Therefore, the structure remains visually coherent and symmetrical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the painted patterns on the spaceshipâ€™s surface free from digital artifacts, such as jagged edges, unnatural brushstroke textures, or inconsistent color gradients that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the vase in the edited image appear smooth and precisely rendered without any digital artifacts. The consistent and clean lines, with uniform color application and lack of jagged edges or unnatural textures, suggest a high-quality rendering of the motifs. This aligns with the conventional characteristics of well-crafted pottery, free from errors or inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Are the abstract wave forms in the landscape below continuous and smoothly curved, avoiding sharp breaks or abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abstract landscape in the edited image features wave-like forms that appear continuous and smoothly curved, without any abrupt or sharp transitions that could disrupt the design. The lines flow naturally, maintaining the integrity of the pattern and providing a harmonious visual effect.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the colors in the transformed landscape consist exclusively of muted earth tones (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) without any bright or out-of-place colors like neon greens or electric blues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the colors within the landscape are composed of muted earth tones including various shades of brown, tan, and dark red. This color palette is consistent with natural and subtle earth tones, without any inclusion of bright or out-of-place colors such as neon greens or electric blues, thus maintaining a cohesive and visually pleasing aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the edited spaceship positioned at a consistent altitude above the abstract landscape, with proper perspective alignment relative to the curved railway tracks below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Instead of a spaceship, the edited image features a vase that is placed above an abstract landscape pattern, resembling a stylized inversion of the railway tracks from the original image. The alignment of the vase with the wavy lines below maintains a consistent perspective, suggesting a balanced altitude relative to the landscape. However, since the landscape is abstract without specific references to altitude like the original railway tracks, the perspective appears artistically consistent.",
