      "question": "Do the metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet reflect light consistently with the scene’s illumination and maintain accurate surface contours without warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a futuristic design with neon elements. The metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet appear to reflect the light accurately from the scene’s illumination. The light reflections match the ambient scene, indicating consistency in the reflective properties. The contours of the materials do not exhibit warping, staying true to the expected smooth metallic finish.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car smooth, evenly lit, and free from jagged edges or overlapping with real-world details like tires or license plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon glow lines in the edited image are designed to accentuate the futuristic theme. They appear smooth and evenly lit, maintaining clarity across the scene. There is no visual interference where neon lines overlap with real-world items like tires or license plates, showcasing careful placement and design.",

      "question": "Is the transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet aligned with the helmet’s curvature, showing clear digital content without ghosting, blurring, or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design includes a futuristic visor displaying digital stats. The display appears to be well-aligned with the helmet's curvature, fitting seamlessly and showing clear content. There’s no visible ghosting or distortion, ensuring readability and maintaining the futuristic aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the holographic cycling stats near the escort car spatially coherent, appropriately sized relative to the car, and displayed with soft edges and ambient glow without casting incorrect shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic cycling stats are integrated with the car's environment to enhance the technological theme. They demonstrate spatial coherence and appropriate scaling relative to the car. The stats exhibit ambient glow with soft edges, maintaining visual harmony without casting incorrect shadows, which can disrupt realism.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements—including metallic finishes, neon glows, digital visor display, and holographic projections—coexist without visual contradictions such as mismatched lighting, texture clashes, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image aims to present a cohesive futuristic appearance across various elements. Each aspect, from metallic finishes to digital enhancements, integrates well within the scene. There is consistency in lighting and textures, and no distorted shapes disrupt the visual harmony—you can see a thoughtful integration reflecting a coherent design theme.",
