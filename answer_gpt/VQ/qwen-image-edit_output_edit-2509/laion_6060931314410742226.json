      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the outlines around each rose petal uniform, continuous, and free of pixelation or irregular breaks that would indicate an unnatural transition from organic form to mosaic pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited image features roses portrayed in a mosaic style. Each petal appears outlined uniformly with a continuous line, suggesting a clear transition from organic form to mosaic pattern. The visual information of Image B indicates that the lines around petals maintain consistent shapes without irregular breaks or pixelation, adhering to the aesthetic of mosaic art. This is derived from understanding the characteristics of mosaic design, where outlines are typically clean and defined.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the petals exhibit smooth transitions between light and dark areas consistent with pearl-like reflectivity, and do the leaves show subtle jade-like translucency without visible texture distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases roses as part of a mosaic design. The petals are predominantly white with stark outlines, typical of mosaic work, and do not demonstrate smooth transitions between light and dark areas that suggest pearl-like reflectivity. The leaves are solidly colored with hints of light and dark green without translucency or reflective quality, characteristic of jade. As mosaic art tends to use solid coloration with limited shading for effect, the lack of such transitions suggests they do not exhibit pearl-like or jade-like qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the architectural features like the arched window and corner pilasters preserved in shape and proportion despite being converted into terracotta-colored tiles, and do they align seamlessly with adjacent mosaic sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural features such as the arched window and pilasters retain their shapes and proportions after conversion into mosaic. These elements are accurately depicted within the mosaic's constraints using terracotta-colored tiles. The mosaic design aligns neatly throughout the structure, ensuring seams and sections fit together cohesively. This reflects world knowledge of mosaic techniques where careful planning of shapes and patterns maintains the integrity of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mosaic rose bush maintain correct spatial placement relative to the building behind it, with no floating or misplaced elements suggesting incorrect depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the rose bush situated in front of the building, with the positioning respecting realistic spatial depth. The roses are grounded, and no elements appear out of place or floating, indicating correct depth perception. This assessment is supported by understanding compositional rules and perspective in artistic renderings, including how elements should be positioned in relation to each other to maintain harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as petal layers, leaf venation, and brick joints preserved in a stylized yet coherent manner, without appearing smeared, distorted, or replaced by flat, featureless surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the mosaic stylization, the details of petal layers and leaf venation are depicted with clear outlines that preserve their essence and structure in a stylized manner. Similarly, the brick joints are distinctively presented with a coherent arrangement. This reflects the typical outcome of mosaic art where elements are simplified yet maintain identifiable features, avoiding any smearing or loss of detail, allowing artistic coherence without abandoning recognizability.",
