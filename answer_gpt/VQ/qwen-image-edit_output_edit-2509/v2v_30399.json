      "question": "Do the giraffes' elongated necks appear structurally coherent and free from unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffes' necks are characteristic of their natural long and slender structure. Visually, the necks in the edited image maintain their smooth, continuous elongation typical of giraffes, free from bends or unnatural shapes. The proportions and curvatures align with what is expected from a giraffe's anatomy, thus appearing coherent without any distortions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows green trees and rocks set against a clear blue sky. These elements match and visually align with the setting in Image A. There are no noticeable editing artifacts affecting the natural appearance of the background, indicating consistency between the two images.",

      "question": "Do the giraffes' faces retain their natural appearance and fine details, avoiding any loss of detail due to the caricature style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals a caricature style applied to the giraffes' faces, giving them exaggerated characteristics, particularly the eyes and expressions, which differ from their natural look. While the bodies retain realistic detail, the facial adjustments portray a cartoon-like appearance, losing some natural finer details present in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the texture of the giraffes' coats appear natural and detailed, without any unnatural textures introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the textures and patterns on the giraffes' coats appear consistent with natural reticulated giraffe markings. The colors and pattern shapes are detailed and realistic, without any artificial alterations, maintaining the natural appearance typical of their species.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the giraffes in the image remain visually credible, maintaining structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B is similar to Image A in terms of the positioning and arrangement of the giraffes within the frame. Despite the caricature facial stylization, the body proportions and positioning maintain a credible and realistic portrayal consistent with giraffes' typical structure, preserving structural consistency across both images.",
