      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the calendar pages clear and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the calendar pages are visible and the markings such as circles and handwritten text appear clear without any distortion. The colors used for circling and writing are distinct and consistently applied across the calendar pages. This clarity indicates that the details were maintained well during the editing process, showing clear planning and annotation without smudging or blurring.",

      "question": "Do the textures of the paper and desk appear natural and consistent with the lighting and shadows in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the paper appears slightly rough and tactile, which is consistent with a realistic depiction of thick paper. The wooden desk shows a smooth surface with some visible grain, which aligns well with the lighting and shadows cast on it, indicating natural light source reflection. Such consistency with expected material appearances implies a coherent scene integrity.",

      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged neatly without any unnatural breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar pages are organized in a stack with slight cinematic shifting that appears intentional as part of a naturally formed pile. Despite overlaps, the edges of the pages lie flat upon one another without misalignment or crooked abnormal angles. They maintain a cohesive visible arrangement that aligns well within a natural and realistic paper stack layout.",

      "question": "Are the text and grid lines on the calendar pages sharp and well-defined without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures calendar pages where the printed text and grid lines are both sharp and well-defined. The clarity in the presentation of numbers and letters as well as lines separating dates is prominent without observable blurring or pixilation, ensuring detail retention and confirming a high-quality depiction.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the handwritten notes and highlights consistent and natural, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used for highlighting and writing on the calendar pages appear distinctly without fading or inconsistent shades. Each note or circle maintains a vibrant yet natural look, making use of primary colors that are common in practical annotations. This implies that the editing ensured color consistency and vibrancy without introducing unrealistic color variations or tones.",
