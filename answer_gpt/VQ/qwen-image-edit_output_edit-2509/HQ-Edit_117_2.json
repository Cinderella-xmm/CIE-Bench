      "question": "Do the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots maintain consistent texture and depth with the original material, without visible artifacts such as floating lines or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots should exhibit a consistent texture and depth typical of hand-etched or embossed pottery. This involves the patterns appearing naturally integrated into the pots without artifacts like lines that appear disconnected ('floating lines') or distortions in shape ('distorted geometry'). By evaluating the visual details in Image B independently, the patterns appear to blend seamlessly with the rest of the pot surface, maintaining coherence with how embossed details would typically be presented on such materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the expanded motifs on the dress proportionally consistent with the garment’s structure, and do they avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress design containing expanded motifs should maintain proportional integrity, meaning the motifs ought to follow the dress’s curves and surface without any signs of distortion that would suggest the fabric gets overstretched. The fabric lines should remain fluid without visible breaks that disturb the pattern continuity expected on a garment. Based on visual analysis in Image B, the dress's motifs look proportionally consistent and follow the garment's structural lines naturally, without noticeable distortion or stretch marks.",

      "question": "Do the transformed bread and cucumber retain recognizable forms as food items while incorporating character features, without unnatural deformations or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed bread and cucumber should visually maintain their recognizable shapes as food items, ensuring that added character features like faces or smiles do not compromise their original form and texture. Analysis indicates that despite the stylized character attributes (such as eyes and smiles), the bread has a distinct loaf shape, and the cucumber displays its elongated form. Both icons are clearly identifiable and devoid of unusual deformations or inconsistencies in texture, preserving their food-like appearance.",

      "question": "Are the boundaries of each postcard vignette cleanly separated from the original image without cutting off elements or introducing edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcards should demarcate specific image sections without intruding into adjoining images' areas or causing unintended cutoffs of essential elements. Additionally, boundaries should be clear and free from artifacts like overlapped sections, blurred edges, or shadowing effects that disrupt the separation. Based on a detailed review, each postcard is distinctly outlined, maintaining separation without affecting neighboring components or introducing boundary artifacts, suggesting a clear cut without errors.",

      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand (visible near the stove) have five fingers with natural proportions and positioning, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For natural appearance, the woman's right hand should show five fingers in a recognizable and anatomically correct placement. The proportions should align naturally with what is expected of a human hand, and the position should not appear awkward or disjointed. Additionally, the illumination and shadowing should correlate with observable light sources to depict realism. In Image B, the analysis reveals that the hand visualization is distorted and does not have a natural look or proper shadowing, possibly indicating issues with rendering or image editing.",
