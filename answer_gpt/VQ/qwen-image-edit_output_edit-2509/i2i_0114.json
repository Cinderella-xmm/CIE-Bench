      "question": "Does the modern man raising a glass appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the structural coherence of the original table arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a modern man in formal attire is sitting at the right end of the table, which affects the balance and coherence of the original arrangement. The scene is supposed to depict the 'Last Supper,' where Jesus and his disciples have a specific placement and spatial relationship with one another. Adding a modern man disrupts this harmony and focal point. Based on the typical table arrangement, he does not naturally fit into the historical context or depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts visible around the modern man in formal attire that disrupt the natural appearance of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the modern man's attire and presence are incongruous with the rest of the painting. The smooth texture of his clothes and the digital edges are highly distinct from the Renaissance fresco's textured, painterly surface. This juxtaposition creates an apparent visual clash in textures and integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the modern man in formal attire blend seamlessly with the artistic style of the original painting, maintaining consistent line work and shading without introducing visually incongruous elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modern man's presence in formal attire within the edited image starkly contrasts with the artistic style of the original painting. The Renaissance style characterized by subtle shading, soft transitions, and historical garb is not matched by the sharp lines and contemporary style of the man's attire, creating a clear incongruity.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the addition of the modern man caused any distortion or damage to the geometric shapes of the table or surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the modern man is added at the table's end, his presence does not seem to distort or damage the geometric shapes of the table or the positions of the surrounding characters. The table's structure appears intact, and no present characters have been visibly dislocated by this addition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the posture and action of the modern man, specifically him raising a glass, visually credible and consistent with the actions of others depicted in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man's gesture of raising a glass does not align with the historical context of the 'Last Supper.' The original participants are engaged in a solemn and profound narrative moment, and their gestures reflect this. The modern man's action introduces a casual, irreverent element which is neither credible nor consistent with the depicted actions and emotions of the others.",
