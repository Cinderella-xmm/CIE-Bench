      "question": "Does the word 'Shine' appear seamlessly integrated into the mirror with no visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' appears to be embedded within the mirror's reflective surface. The edges of the text are smooth and show no signs of pixelation or other unnatural artifacts that might indicate poor editing. This suggests that the integration is seamless. The brightness and sharpness of the word match well with the LED-like glow effect around the mirror, contributing to its seamless appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and glow effect of the word 'Shine' consistent with the aesthetic of the bathroom and does not look out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bathroom has a modern and minimalist design with clean lines and a neutral color palette. The glow effect of the word 'Shine' mirrors the illumination of the mirror frame, maintaining aesthetic consistency. The addition of the neon-style word complements the contemporary design and does not appear out of place in the setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the addition of the word 'Shine' maintain the mirror's original shape and proportions, avoiding any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the mirror retains its rectangular shape and proportions despite the overlay of the word 'Shine.' The text is centered and does not cause any warping or distortion of the mirror's structure, indicating that the mirror's original geometric integrity is preserved.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reflective properties of the mirror undisturbed by the addition of 'Shine', preserving the clarity and detail of the mirrorâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' is presented as a bright, glowing text within the mirror, likely intended as a design element rather than obstructing the reflective surface. The text does not appear to disturb the reflective quality around its presence, as evident by the consistent illumination effects throughout the mirror. Thus, the reflective properties are effectively preserved.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning, size, and lighting of the word 'Shine' seem authentic, enhancing rather than detracting from the visual credibility of the bathroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' is positioned centrally within the mirror, sized appropriately to fit well without overwhelming the mirror. The lighting effect mimics a natural glow consistent with the mirror's frame lighting, enhancing the bathroom's ambiance instead of detracting from it. The harmonious integration supports the believability and aesthetic of the setting.",
