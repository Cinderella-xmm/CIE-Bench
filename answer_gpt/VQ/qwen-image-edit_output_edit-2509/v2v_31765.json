      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables maintain their structural coherence and visual credibility after being transformed into a Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements resemble a Cubist artwork, characterized by fragmented and abstract geometric shapes. Cubism deliberately distorts and reassembles objects in a non-representational way. As such, the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables do not maintain structural coherence or visual credibility typical of accurately depicted vegetables. Cubism is not intended for naturalistic representation but instead portrays an artistic abstraction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the diced carrots, celery, and onions natural and detailed, without any obvious loss of detail in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits an artistic, abstract style where natural textures are transformed into bold, flat colors and shapes typical of Cubist art. There is no focus on realistic texture detailing. The textures of diced vegetables, such as the smoothness or roughness of their surfaces, are lost in the transformation to abstract forms.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors of the diced carrots, celery, and onions appear authentic and harmonious, contributing to the overall natural appearance in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are vibrant and contrasting, aligning with a Cubist palette that prioritizes artistic expression over realism. While the colors may be vivid and harmonious in an artistic sense, they do not mimic the natural appearance one would expect from real diced vegetables. Hence, they do not contribute to a 'natural appearance,' which is not the goal in a Cubist style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables intact and undistorted, without any broken edges or unnatural deformations in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents fragmented and creative shapes characteristic of Cubism, where objects are intentionally broken up, abstracted, and reassembled. The geometric shapes of the vegetables are not intact or undistorted; instead, they are intentionally altered and abstracted, which includes broken edges and deformations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the knife retain its natural appearance and structural integrity, without any obvious artifacts or distortions in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is abstracted and part of the Cubist reinterpretation, which likely means it does not retain a naturalistic appearance or structural integrity typically found in realistic depictions. The shapes and forms may appear distorted to conform to the artistic style, introducing artifacts and distortions in alignment with the Cubist theme.",
