      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its structural integrity with no signs of distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "First, analyzing Image B independently, the parking meter appears structurally intact with no visible distortions or unusual textures. The surface is smooth, and the details like the numbers and lettering are clear and precise. Based on common occurrences and understanding of visual editing, such structural preservation indicates that the image retains its integrity without any alterations resulting in distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transition between the parking meter and the new desert highway background smooth and devoid of visible edges or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the transition between the parking meter and its background seems visually coherent. There are no noticeable sharp edges or breaks that typically occur when an object is improperly edited onto a background. The lighting and shadows blend well, suggesting a smooth transition. This observation is based on world knowledge of image editing principles for smooth compositional integration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting effects on the parking meter match what would be expected in a desert setting under bright sunlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the parking meter with shadows that fall naturally to one side and lighting that suggests bright sunlight, typical of a desert environment. Shadows are consistent with a high sun angle, which aligns with expectations for such a setting. Common sense and environmental knowledge together indicate that these visual effects are harmonious with a desert scenario.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any irregular or unnatural shapes in the desert landscape that seem out of place or disrupt the scene's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a typical desert landscape with a straightforward highway, scattered bushes, and a clear sky, all elements that one would expect in such an environment. The shapes are natural and consistent with the landscape rather than irregular or disruptive. World knowledge about desert landscapes informs this understanding, suggesting authenticity in the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parking meter appear naturally placed in the desert highway setting without looking misplaced or awkward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When evaluating Image B, the parking meter is positioned in a manner that does not appear awkward or drastically out of place despite its unexpected presence. The visual integration with the desert background, in terms of lighting and context, allows it to appear coherent within the scene. This conclusion is supported by the principles of compositional harmony and visual placement which guide assessments of natural placement.",
