      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain of the dog appear naturally integrated into the image without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style keychain hangs from a silver ring which is held in a person's hand. The keychain has a smooth, matte finish typical of cartoon designs, with vibrant colors and clear outlines that are characteristic of chibi-style artwork. There are no visible artifacts or irregularities around the edges of the keychain or the hand, suggesting it is well-integrated into the image without any mismatch or unrealistic textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style keychain consistent with the hand holding it, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hand holding a keychain featuring a chibi-style dog. Visually, the size of the keychain is proportional to typical small accessories, fitting comfortably within the grip of the hand. The keychain and hand are depicted realistically, without any distortion, suggesting consistent proportions and rationality between the two elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain accurately depict the dog's essential features and characteristics from the original image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the features, the keychain in Image B represents a stylized version of the dog in Image A. The main characteristics such as the Yorkshire Terrier's long hair, facial shape, and ears are preserved in the chibi-style design, but simplified for a cartoon representation. While simplified, these essential features are recognizable and convey the breed and style accurately, making the depiction credible despite the chibi abstraction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the chibi-style keychain preserved and look natural, without any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style keychain is depicted with clear outlines and a simple color palette typical for such designs, which is consistent with cartoon depictions rather than photographic detail. The surface texture appears smooth and even, typical of manufactured keychains, without pixelated edges or blurring, maintaining an appearance that is natural and suitable for the style without compromising detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the connection between the chibi-style keychain and the tiny silver keyring appear natural and physically plausible, without any structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is attached to a metal ring, appearing as a typical keyring setup. The connection point is depicted as securely closed around the loop of the keychain, matching expected physical interaction and attachment designs for such accessories. There are no apparent gaps or irregularities, ensuring a plausible and realistic connection.",
