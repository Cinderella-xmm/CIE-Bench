      "question": "Are the textures and details of the horse and people preserved naturally without any unnatural artifacts after the monochrome conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monochrome conversion in Image B simplifies colors to shades of black, white, and gray. The horse's muscles, mane, and the people's clothing retain their textures reasonably well, but some finer details, like the rich texture of fur and fabric seen in original color from Image A, are lost. The transition might introduce slight artifacts due to color transitions that aren't perfect in grayscale.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions and shapes of the horse and people look realistic and undistorted in the monochrome rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the horse and people remain unchanged from Image A, preserving realism and accurate body shapes. The monochrome effect does not distort these aspects; rather, it only affects color representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements such as trees and the trailer retain their natural appearance and details without any loss or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements in Image B lose some detail due to the monochrome conversion. Trees and the trailer are simplified into basic shapes and shades without intricate texture details that are evident in Image A. This results in a less detailed and somewhat unnatural representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the people and the horse appear natural and coherent without any visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interaction between the horse and the people is preserved well in Image B, maintaining the positions and postures accurately without introducing distortions or incoherence. Their spatial arrangement and interaction are still logical and visually coherent.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the rustic typography used for event details blend naturally with the image without disrupting its overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in Image B stands out noticeably against the scene. While it serves its purpose in providing information, it contrasts with the image style and doesn't blend seamlessly; the text could distract from the image rather than complement it in a natural manner.",
