    "Question": "Q1: Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",
    "explanation": "In Image B (the edited image), the guitar body is transformed into an armored torso, featuring elements like armor plating and energy outlines. However, the original basic outline of the guitar body—an elongated oval shape—is still recognizable and mostly intact. The visual transformation into armor does not drastically modify the overall silhouette of the guitar body from its original form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a guitar body turned into an armored torso with a metallic finish. Unlike the natural wood grain in Image A, this finish has a stylized, illustrative appearance with a shiny, armored texture that doesn’t replicate the wooden pattern. It's a creative transformation featuring a more abstract, comic-book metallic look, which inherently involves artificial texture application beyond natural wood characteristics.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
    "explanation": "The edited image features illustrative lines representing energy or motion effects. These lines are mostly evenly spaced and aligned across the flowing cape and enhance the torso's curvature, respecting its structure. The lines integrate well without cutting through major guitar elements, indicating a deliberate artistic design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the body’s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar strings maintain their continuity and appear taut like muscle strands across the guitar body. They follow the natural contour of the instrument and do not exhibit any visual issues like kinks or floating segments, preserving their structural integrity in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
    "explanation": "The imagery in Image B shows a cape extending from the guitar neck. It displays smooth, flowing folds with consistent sound wave-like patterns, reinforcing the dynamic motion effect across the entire length of the cape. There are no abrupt changes or interruptions in the design of the cape, indicating a fluid and coherent extension from the instrument.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the emblem on the headstock fully visible, correctly aligned, and not overlapping with the tuning pegs or brand name?",
    "explanation": "The altered design in Image B presents a headstock that includes energy effects which might obscure clarity, but the emblem is visible and correctly placed in relation to the tuning pegs and brand name. It does not overlap with these functional elements, ensuring the emblem maintains a separate position in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the combined graphic elements, such as the armored torso and energy effects, are blended smoothly with the guitar's original parts without noticeable artifacts like pixelation or color bleeding. The transitions between the design additions and the existing guitar features are handled cleanly, with no sharp discontinuities evident.",
    "answer": "No"
