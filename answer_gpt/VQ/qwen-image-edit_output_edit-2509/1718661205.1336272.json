      "question": "Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the LEGO model of the military ship appears to maintain its original shape and structural proportions well. Observing its visual aspects, the bricks are aligned correctly, and the overall model does not show distortions commonly seen in poorly constructed LEGO sets. The LEGO parts seem to be precisely assembled to represent a ship accurately based on its intended design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In this analysis, the LEGO-rendered ocean waves in the image reflect a smooth, natural wave motion within the constraints of LEGO construction. The pieces used to depict waves manage to deliver variances in height and flow, breaking the uniform appearance typical in flattened or overly rigid designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO accessories on the boat deck, including elements like controls, are analyzed to be consistent with the size and perspective of the surrounding scene as well as the character. Correct proportions and placement are critical for maintaining visual harmony, which appears successfully executed in this LEGO setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt retain their original colors and show no signs of unnatural texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO-textured life vest and shirt appear to have maintained their color integrity without any signs of texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges. The resolution is smooth and properly executed, showcasing the intended LEGO aesthetic without typically visible digital flaws.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model's placement on the shelf is notable for its coherence in structure and space. The shelf has realistic depth and shadow cues, ensuring visual correctness and suggesting structural soundness which complements the detailed LEGO assembly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A thorough examination of the LEGO model shows no visible artifacts, such as jagged lines or misaligned bricks, that often disrupt the illusion of solid construction. The integrity of the model is maintained, with each piece fitting accurately to form a cohesive unit.",
