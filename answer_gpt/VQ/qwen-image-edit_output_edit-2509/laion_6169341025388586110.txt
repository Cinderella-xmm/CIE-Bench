    "Question": "Q1: Does the statue exhibit a consistent clay-like texture across all body parts, including the face, limbs, and torso, without visible patches of mismatched material or unnatural graininess?",
    "explanation": "The statue in Image B appears to have a consistent clay-like texture throughout its body parts, including the limbs and torso. The visual cues show a uniform surface with no indication of mismatched material or unnatural graininess. This consistency suggests a thoughtful design where the texture is meant to resemble clay, which is common in statues designed to look handcrafted or artistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome fully transparent with no visible distortion of the statue's shape or features behind it, and does it display natural reflections and refractions consistent with real glass?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to be transparent, as the statue’s shape and features can be viewed without distortion. Additionally, natural reflections and slight refractions are visible, consistent with the properties of real glass, which typically offer transparency while reflecting light in realistic ways. No major anomalies or distortions impede the view through the glass.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome evenly spaced, clearly defined, and integrated smoothly into the surface without overlapping or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome in Image B are clearly defined and seem to be evenly spaced and smoothly integrated into the surface. The design appears intentional and well-rendered, with no overlapping or jagged edges that would disrupt the visual symmetry. Such patterns are often symbolic and require precise placement to maintain aesthetic appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights under the spotlight without visible halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights that are visually appealing under the spotlight. These highlights do not show halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas, which might otherwise detract from their appearance. The use of lighting accentuates their features in a balanced manner, which is critical for maintaining the intended visual impact.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the muscle contours on the statue’s arms, chest, and legs accurately shaded with smooth gradients that follow the underlying anatomy and directional light source?",
    "explanation": "The muscle contours on the statue in Image B are accurately shaded with smooth gradients that seem to follow the underlying anatomy. The lighting appears directional, enhancing the depth and dimensionality of the muscles realistically. Such shading requires an understanding of human anatomy and light behavior to ensure the statue looks lifelike and visually coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the incense holders positioned at ground level around the base of the pedestal, correctly scaled, and free from floating or clipping against other structures?",
    "explanation": "The incense holders in Image B are positioned at ground level around the base of the pedestal. They appear correctly scaled in relation to the statue and other elements of the scene. There is no evidence of them floating or clipping against other structures, ensuring a coherent and stable composition within the environment depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
