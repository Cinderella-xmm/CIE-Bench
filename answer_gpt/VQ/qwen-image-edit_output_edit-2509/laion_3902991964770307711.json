      "question": "Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra appear to be made of glass, characterized by their transparent nature and tapered shape. The way light interacts with these parts, showing realistic reflections and refraction typical of glass material, confirms their glass-like properties. The contours are smooth, contributing to a realistic portrayal of glass caps.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms and central shaft in Image B exhibit a consistent gold finish. The surface is smooth, with an even reflection of light, indicating a metallic finish. There are no visible seams or breaks, suggesting it is a continuous piece of tubing. This description relies on the effect of consistent lighting and the absence of discontinuities.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo is positioned on the base of the candelabra. Although the logo stands out due to its design, it is embossed in a way that integrates with the base's surface. There's no significant disparity in depth or irregular lighting around the logo, supporting the idea that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on Image B are intricately engraved onto the central tube. These patterns are evenly distributed and follow the curvature of the candelabra naturally. There is no apparent flattening or unnatural repetition visible, nor do they appear as mere surface overlays, indicating that these engravings are well-integrated with the object’s design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The script font label on the central tube in Image B is applied in a way that it follows the curvature of the tube seamlessly. The text does not exhibit warping or stretching, maintaining a clear and legible appearance. It is also positioned such that it does not overlap with other surface details, preserving its readability and aesthetic function.",
