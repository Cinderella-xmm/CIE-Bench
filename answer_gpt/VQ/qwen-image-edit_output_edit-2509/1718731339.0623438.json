    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figure showcases intricate details like spikes, rivets, and surface textures that remain clear and precise, indicating high-resolution rendering. The preserved detail signifies that the miniaturization process retained the distinct features without distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a glass dome that is smooth and clear, enveloping the figure without seams or noticeable distortions. The clarity of the glass ensures the armor's appearance is undistorted and not skewed by refraction, suggesting a seamless and quality design of the dome.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cogwheels visible in Image B appear firmly integrated into the base with neatly interlocking teeth, maintaining proportionality in size. They are appropriately grounded without any indication of floating or inconsistency, highlighting the precise mechanical design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical wings in Image B have seamless attachment to the shoulder armor, exhibiting a cohesive metal texture and spike design that aligns with the overall armor aesthetics. There are no unnatural bends or misaligned joints, demonstrating a well-integrated structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper pipes in Image B flow continuously along the armor, maintaining a consistent diameter and bend smoothly around the joints. They are positioned to not intersect with key armor elements, providing functional and aesthetic coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows brass orbs that are strategically placed at different distances, avoiding any physical contact or clipping into the armor or glass dome. They showcase a consistent material finish and lighting, indicating a well-considered design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
