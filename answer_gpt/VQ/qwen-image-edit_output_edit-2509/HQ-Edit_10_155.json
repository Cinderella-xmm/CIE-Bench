      "question": "Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears transparent and smooth by observing the clarity of the elements inside, such as the lantern and market scene. No cracks or unnatural refraction patterns are visible, indicating that the artisanship of the dome allows an undistorted view and gives a clear perception of depth. This suggests that the refraction and clarity are well-rendered and consistent with a high-quality glass dome.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the ceramic street pavements in Image B, the tiles are evident by their distinct lines and transitions. The colors transition accurately without any discernible blurring or misalignment. The uniform spacing and well-defined edges suggest precise modeling typically present in miniature scenescapes, reflecting attention to detail in execution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing the proportions and details in Image B, the textile merchants and canopies maintain a miniature scale relative to the lantern. Their shapes seem realistic, with fabric textures captured in a way that appears natural rather than stretched or misaligned. Each piece stands out individually, avoiding duplication or unnatural blending with other scene components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees feature fronds shaped realistically, signaling skilled attention to detail. Their bases seem to be rooted with consistent shadows emanating in line with the lantern's light source, adding depth and linkage to the ground within the diorama. This setup avoids any appearance of flatness or detachment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observation of the dome's base in Image B highlights a nuanced texture, suggesting a natural weathered appearance. Subtle tonal variations and depth add to this realism, and there is no evidence of uniformity or digital artifacts which would imply over-processing. This indicates a balanced execution in digital rendering.",
