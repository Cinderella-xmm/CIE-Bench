      "question": "Are the train’s locomotive and carriages transformed into interlocking geometric blocks that maintain their original proportions and alignment along the track without visible distortions or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train’s locomotive and carriages are depicted as part of a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces of the puzzle suggest an interlocking design consistent with the original proportions and alignment seen in typical train representations. No visible distortions or misalignments are evident in the puzzle pieces or their edges, which aligns with the seamless design often intended in puzzle depictions. Thus, the transformation maintains the overall integrity and composure of the train along the track.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the smoke above the train rendered as smooth, continuous swirling white forms that follow the natural trajectory of rising steam without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B is part of a puzzle, characterized by interlocking pieces that inherently create breaks or separations due to their nature. Despite the visualization within a puzzle format, the pieces maintain a coherent pattern illustrating a general trajectory of rising steam. However, the nature of puzzle pieces creates jagged edges and visible separations, unlike a smooth, continuous form, thus not fulfilling a seamless effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are all human figures at the station platform replaced by small, flat puzzle-shaped elements wearing vintage clothing, with no visible distortions in limbs or posture, and do they retain recognizable positions relative to benches and luggage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are depicted with puzzle pieces, fitting the setting and showing interaction with elements like benches and luggage. While the puzzle’s nature might create visual separations, the human figures still retain recognizable postures and positions corresponding to the environment. They are dressed historically, matching the vintage clothing mentioned, illustrating consistency in depiction within the puzzle format.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fields and hills in the background rendered as clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., rectangles, triangles) that form a cohesive, interlocking design without gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fields and hills are depicted with distinct geometric puzzle pieces that fit together logically without overlapping errors or abrupt changes, forming a visually cohesive background. The interlocking nature of puzzle pieces ensures no gaps, allowing a continuous, organized pattern throughout the landscape, adhering to a geometric, puzzle-based design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape, placed on a light wooden tabletop with visible wood grain and consistent lighting, and are there no floating elements or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the scene as part of a jigsaw puzzle laid on what appears to be a wooden tabletop. The tabletop has visible wood grain and consistent lighting, suggesting a coherent background that aids the perception of the puzzle. The positioning of the puzzle eliminates the presence of any floating elements or shadows that do not correspond with the light source, ensuring a believable and uniform setting.",
