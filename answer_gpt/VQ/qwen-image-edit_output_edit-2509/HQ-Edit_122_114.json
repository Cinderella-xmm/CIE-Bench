      "question": "Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cogs and gears seen in Image B are visually interconnected, forming a continuous mechanical pattern which maintains the structural integrity of the design. Such a formation closely simulates the alignment needed for mechanical continuity, showing no apparent gaps or floating elements that would disrupt the geometric arrangement. This reflects a meticulous design aligning with known mechanical assemblies that require interlocking to function correctly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper pipes in Image B are visually aligned with the roof edges, maintaining consistent thickness that suggests plausible functionality for potential fluid or steam conduits, as commonly used in industrial designs. Their path follows a logical course along the roof, avoiding abrupt bends or unsupported, floating sections that would otherwise disrupt their physical plausibility.",

      "question": "Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic plates on the stork in Image B are arranged to mimic the typical feather layering seen on birds, providing a seamless transition across its body. These plates follow the anatomy contours effectively, avoiding unnatural overlaps or gaps that might detract from a realistic representation of a metal-clad creature, adhering to known principles of biomechanical design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical joints appear intentionally placed at key anatomical intersections that would match the expected range of motion for a bird. These joints avoid distortion or misplacement, reflecting an understanding of avian anatomy as translated into a mechanical construct, which is consistent with biomechanics seen in engineered representations of animals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays an integration where mechanical elements complement the structure of the wooden house, maintaining proportional harmony. The pipes and cogs are sized to fit aesthetically with the house structure, avoiding disproportionate scaling or unsupported suspension, which ensures functional and visual coherence, adhering to coherent design principles.",
