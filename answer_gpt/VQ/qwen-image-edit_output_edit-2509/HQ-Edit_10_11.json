      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays the gorilla with a wood texture throughout its body. The consistency in texture and shading is evident as the light and shadows follow a natural progression around the contours of the gorilla. There are no abrupt color changes or areas that deviate from the wood theme, indicating a cohesive application of the wood effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the gorilla's body features patterns that mimic the grain of wood. These patterns exhibit variations in direction and depth, giving them a natural, organic look similar to real wood grain. The lines are not repetitive or overly uniform which aligns with how wood grain typically appears.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the anatomical structure of the gorilla, even with the wood texture applied. The arms and legs appear proportional, with joints represented accurately. There is no indication of excessive smoothing that would lead to flattened or misshapen sections, thereby preserving the anatomical integrity of the limbs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image features wood patterns with etched designs. Darker leaf shapes are incorporated within these patterns, adding depth. The background and gorilla appear well-integrated, with the etched patterns providing a sense of layering that complements the three-dimensional form of the gorilla.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, leaves are depicted in darker wood tones within the background. Their placement suggests they are resting on or embedded into the wooden surface, showing natural interaction with the environment. The leaves do not seem to be floating or incorrectly overlapping, reinforcing the impression of a realistic wood-carved scene.",
