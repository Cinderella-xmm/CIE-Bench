      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the elderly man’s robe evenly distributed, continuous across folds and seams, and free from jagged edges or texture repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe's geometric patterns are bright and intricate, adding vibrancy to the outfit. The patterns appear to be evenly distributed across the surface but might not seem as continuous across folds and seams due to the multiple colors and complexity of the designs. The vibrant colors can cause challenges in maintaining continuity and avoiding jagged edges, especially along the robe's seams and folds. Comparing this with Image A, where the robe has traditional, more subdued patterns, Image B's patterns are likely more prone to continuity and clarity issues.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ornate wooden staff maintain a natural wood appearance with coherent grain direction, proper thickness, and no floating or detached decorative elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the staff has transformed into a more ornate item compared to a simpler walking cane in Image A. The staff shows a more elaborate design with significant detail at the top. A coherent grain direction and proper thickness are necessary for maintaining a natural wood appearance while ensuring that decorative elements do not appear detached or floating. The ornate design might obscure some natural qualities, which can create some visual tension in how the grain and decorations align naturally.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the spice piles in the background visibly intensified but still physically plausible, without color bleed, haloing, or loss of individual grain texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the spice piles are indeed intensified, showing more vibrant hues compared to Image A. These colors appear physically plausible, maintaining a believable and rich appearance without the visible issues of color bleed or haloing. Additionally, the individual grain textures of the spices still appear distinct, indicating careful editing to ensure the realism of the intensified colors.",

      "question": "Is the decorative border motif clearly defined, properly aligned with the image’s edge, and positioned without intersecting or distorting any existing elements such as people, stalls, or ground tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative border motif is eye-catching and aligns properly with the image's edges. It is a clear addition that does not intersect or distort existing elements, such as people, stalls, or ground tiles, as these elements remain undisturbed. The border frames the scene without overlapping the central subjects, ensuring clarity and separation from the original content of the image.",

      "question": "Does the wooden box held by the man show consistent wood grain, proper shadowing under ambient light, and natural flower arrangement without distorted petals or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden box appears consistent in texture, suggesting a coherent wood grain similar to Image A. The box is depicted under ambient light, contributing to natural shadowing that matches the lighting conditions. The flowers within the box retain a natural appearance, with a believable arrangement and color consistency. There is no evidence of distorted petals or unnatural color shifts, thereby maintaining a realistic portrayal.",
