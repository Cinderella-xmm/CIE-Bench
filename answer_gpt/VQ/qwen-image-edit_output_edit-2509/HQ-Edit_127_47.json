      "question": "Are the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb correctly proportioned and undistorted despite the spherical enclosure, with no visible warping or bending of vertical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees, mountains, and water appear to be inside a glass orb. To analyze their proportion and distortion, I visually inspect the lines of these elements. The vertical lines of the trees and the edges of the mountains should appear straight without any curvature typically caused by the distortion of a spherical enclosure. The trees and mountains appear upright, and there are no visual cues indicating bending, warping, or distortion. This suggests that the image composition was carefully adjusted to maintain proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ducks retain their natural body shape and size relative to the water and rocks, with smooth, reflective surfaces that do not show exaggerated shine or unnatural specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks appear as small figurines inside the globe. To determine if they retain natural body shapes and sizes, I consider their proportions relative to the surrounding water and rocks. They appear consistent with the expectations for small duck figurines in miniature settings. Their surfaces are smooth and reflect light without excessive shine or highlights that would be exaggerated. There's a realistic portrayal of toy duck characteristics, maintaining the theme of the glass orb.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the water beneath the ducks transparent enough to clearly see the rocky bottom, with no visible layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water inside the orb is transparent, allowing a clear view of the rocky bottom beneath the ducks. This transparency appears uniform, with a realistic level of opacity consistent with clear water. No visual artifacts, such as odd layers or texture patterns, are discernible that would disrupt the natural view of underwater rocks. The overall water clarity maintains a consistency that reflects a realistic miniature representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature animal figurines positioned on solid surfaces (rocks or ground), properly scaled compared to surrounding elements, and free from floating or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature animal figurines are part of the environment depicted within the orb. They rest upon the visible rocky surface, indicating solid support. Their scale is appropriate relative to the surrounding details such as water and ducks. These figures appear grounded without any indication of floating, and shadows follow a consistent direction matching the lighting, signifying a realistic interaction between light and object placement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wood base have a natural grain pattern and cast a consistent shadow under the orb, indicating physical contact and realistic lighting interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood base supports the glass orb and exhibits a realistic wood grain pattern consistent with common wooden textures. This grain adds authenticity to the miniaturized scene. The orb casts a consistent shadow onto the surface beneath, implying a strong physical connection between the orb and the base. The light interaction appears natural, indicating shadows and highlights corresponding to a singular light source.",
