    "Question": "Q1: Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we have to infer from the rest of the visible parts. The neck and shoulders exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns and maintain accurate proportions without distortions. Considering this, it is reasonable to assume the same level of quality and consistency for the facial area despite the blur.",
