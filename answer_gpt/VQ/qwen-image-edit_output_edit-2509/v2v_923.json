    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the creature's body maintain structural coherence and visual plausibility, avoiding any unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the creature is designed with detailed patterns and textures that are highly stylized. The patterns appear consistent and coherent across its body, showing no signs of unnatural distortions or broken geometries. The curves and shapes of the creature are visually plausible, reflecting a well-structured design. The process of analysis depends on understanding creature design, where consistency in pattern and shape contributes to a believable visual appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the orb or capsule near the creature's feet blend seamlessly with the surrounding elements, avoiding any unnatural textures or out-of-place patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb in image B showcases intricate designs similar to those on the creature's body. These patterns are harmonious with the overall theme and are consistent with the creature's color palette. The textures are natural and integrate well with the visual style of the scene, showing no signs of dissonance or being out-of-place. In analyzing seamless blending, the understanding of consistent art style and pattern helps determine integration quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the scissors, ruler, pen, and patterned paper preserved, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, these elements are not present. In analyzing image A, these objects are utilitarian items with clear, sharp edges and clean details. However, when comparing this to image B, these items aren't visible, indicating the focus shifted entirely to the creature design without any degradation concerns. This demonstrates a shift in theme and focuses rather than artifact preservation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the creature's design elements, such as patterns and textures, align with the visual cues from the scissors, ruler, pen, and patterned paper, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the creature's design follows a distinct artistic style with patterns and color motifs. These visual cues may conceptually align with crafting instruments like scissors, rulers, and patterned paper as observed in image A, reflecting an association with precision and intricate designs. This understanding comes from linking the concept of crafting precision in image A to the detailed design of the creature in image B, emphasizing a natural design logic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the creature, the orb/capsule, and the text displaying the creature's name and elemental type visually credible and well-integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a composition with the creature centrally positioned and an orb beside it. The text below the creature provides context about its design inspiration or elements. This composition aligns with typical design presentations, making it visually credible and cohesive. Integration is judged by how the creature, orb, and text occupy and relate spatially within the frame, contributing to a coherent scene.",
