    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are depicted with cartoonish facial features and accessories, such as a red helmet and a blue cap. These elements appear to fit the heads of the paddles appropriately without covering an excessive area or altering the shape of the paddles themselves. The rubber surface beneath appears consistent and not distorted. This integration matches the exaggerated but proportionate design typically found in animation and illustration styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the cartoon facial features and accessories are drawn without any visible stitching lines or sharp edges. The shading and coloring are smoothly applied, typical of digital illustrations where transitions between different elements and colors are harmonious and consistent, thus ensuring a seamless integration into the overall design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold edges of the treasure chest appear well delineated around the perimeter of the lid and base. There are no visible instances where the gold extends into the interior space or forms disconnected segments. This consistent design choice is customary in illustrations to show the boundary and structure clearly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles are positioned such that their tails point directly towards the paddles, indicating communication. The tails do not overlap with the treasure chest or paddle handles, which indicates thoughtful placement within the illustration where speech bubbles are used to avoid obstruction of key elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The treasure map in the background of Image B displays uniformly drawn lines typical of digital illustrations, where stroke widths are controlled for consistency. There is no apparent pixelation or aliasing observed, which often is avoided in vector illustrations or high-resolution digital artwork to maintain clarity and visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paddles in Image B are depicted rising upwards from the treasure chest, supported visually by the handle slots. This angling gives the sense that they are anchored plausibly within the frame of the illustration while simultaneously expressing an animated 'jump' from the chest, aligning with cartoon styling conventions.",
