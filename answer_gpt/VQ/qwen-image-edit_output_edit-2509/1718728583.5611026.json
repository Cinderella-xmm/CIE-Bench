    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot's body exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's body is characterized by sleek, smooth, and metallic surfaces that mimic chrome. These surfaces appear continuous without abrupt texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions. The design visually suggests a futuristic aesthetic, consistent with chrome-like materials commonly seen in sci-fi contexts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos rendered as cohesive geometric shapes with consistent edges and proportions, without fragmented or disconnected components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the flamingos are depicted with stylized, almost graphic representations. The edges and proportions are cohesive, forming consistent geometric shapes. Despite the artistic approach, the components remain connected and integrated, reflecting deliberate design rather than fragmentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and rocks in the background have angular, stylized forms that maintain consistent perspective and spatial relationships without appearing disjointed or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and rocks are intentionally stylized with angular forms, creating a unique visual aesthetic. These elements maintain a consistent perspective in relation to each other and the scene, with spatial relationships intact, avoiding any disjointed or floating appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette across the entire scene consistently muted and pastel-toned, with no areas exhibiting sudden or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is consistently muted and pastel-toned, which is evident in the soft pinks and blues throughout the scene. This choice creates a serene and harmonious atmosphere, with no abrupt or jarring color deviations that might disrupt the visual continuity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the robot's hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or malformed digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's hands are depicted with five fingers each. The fingers appear to have a natural curvature and are spaced proportionally, mimicking human hand anatomy and avoiding any extra or malformed digits, thus maintaining anatomical consistency in design.",
