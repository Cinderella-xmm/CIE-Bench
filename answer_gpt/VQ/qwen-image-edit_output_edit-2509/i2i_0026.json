      "question": "Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body proportions are systematically illustrated in a simplified style typical for instructional or educational material. Each frame maintains consistent anatomical proportions such as arm-to-torso ratio and leg length. Movements reflect standard tennis techniques, with visible weight shifts and racket positions that match actual gameplay, based on how player stances and swings are taught. This suggests the movements are natural and the proportions consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses line art to depict the tennis racket, which lacks the detailed textures found in real-life depictions. The line art style simplifies all elements, resulting in a lack of realistic textures, such as string detail or handle grip. Thus, the rackets are stylized and not meant to appear realistic, which aligns with the monochrome art style, which does not typically introduce artifacts but simplifies details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The line art in Image B illustrates hand positioning that appears consistent with common tennis grips across all frames. The wrist and hand positions convey an understanding of natural hold mechanics, as they align with ergonomic standards typical in tennis training, showing correct grip handling and control, especially for forehand and backhand swings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the removal of the background provides a stark contrast that enhances visual clarity by focusing solely on the subject matter, which is typical of instructional illustrations. The monochrome palette ensures simplicity and minimizes distraction, effectively communicating motion and technique without distortion. The key elements remain distinguishable and clean, negating any minor details' importance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sequence of actions from preparation to follow-through in the clean line art style visually coherent and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B organizes a logical progression of actions resembling a tennis swing sequence, starting with preparation and following through to the end of the stroke. The poses and transitions are coherent and effectively display a realistic sequence of movements as expected in tennis teaching aids, illustrating each stage with clarity and continuity.",
