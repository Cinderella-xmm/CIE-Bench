      "question": "Does the transformed house maintain consistent geometric shapes without jagged edges, overlapping planes, or unnatural fragmentation that disrupts structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house facade has been transformed into a colorful geometric pattern using distinct shapes. Analyzing these shapes, they share consistent clean lines and defined edges, providing a structured appearance. Such a transformation uses geometric knowledge to ensure that these shapes fit together without disrupting the structural integrity. Comparing this with Image A, where the house has a traditional design, the transformation successfully maintains a consistent geometric pattern without jagged or overlapping planes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract representations of the crowd evenly distributed across their original positions without clustering or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd has been transformed into colorful abstract shapes resembling human figures. These shapes are distributed across the landscape, maintaining a similar spatial arrangement to the actual crowd seen in Image A. There is no clustering or misplaced elements that would violate the spatial logic of a crowd's typical distribution standing or walking. The transformation successfully respects the original spatial logic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the checkered pattern applied uniformly across the entire grass surface without visible seams, inconsistent spacing, or distortion at edges near sand traps and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The checkered pattern in Image B covers a significant portion of the grass area, with clearly defined squares. The analysis reveals consistent spacing and uniform geometry, extending across the grass surface into the edge areas, including around sand traps and near the water. This ensures spatial continuity without distortion or seams, accommodating the natural contours of the grass. Compared to Image A's natural green grass, the checkered pattern maintains uniformity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky in fragmented but coherent angular segments without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows prismatic shards scattered across the water, creating fragmented reflective patterns. These shards reflect the house and sky in varied angles, maintaining coherence without ghosting or blurring effects. Colors blend naturally without harsh separations, producing a vibrant reflection consistent with how light would interact with prismatic surfaces. Image A has natural water reflections, but Image B uses geometric transformations precisely to achieve coherent reflections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vibrant geometric planes on the houseâ€™s facade consistently lit and shaded to match the ambient light direction, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house facade features vibrantly colored geometric planes. These shapes appear well-lit, consistent with ambient lighting from the top left, as inferred from the shadows in the surrounding landscape. The shading and highlights on these planes match the light direction without appearing unnatural or mismatched. This ensures that the transformation respects ambient light dynamics typical of outdoor scenes, unlike the original lighting observed in Image A.",
