      "question": "Does the character's transformation into an anime-style action figure maintain natural textures and fine details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a figure in the style of anime characters, which is commonly associated with simplified designs, bright colors, and exaggerated expressions rather than natural textures and fine detail. The depiction aligns with typical anime aesthetics, which might include intentional stylistic artifacts such as simplified shading and smoother surfaces. Therefore, while the transformation is consistent with anime style, it does not maintain natural textures characteristic of real-life objects.",

      "question": "Does the box design seamlessly integrate with the rest of the image, maintaining visual credibility without disrupting the overall scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box design in Image B is stylized with graphics and text typical of anime merchandise packaging. It harmonizes with the contents inside and is designed to reflect a cohesive theme, including the Luffy character and airplane elements from 'One Piece'. Despite its distinct style, it convincingly blends into the scene with no glaring inconsistencies, providing an effective visual transition between the box and the real-life setting beside it.",

      "question": "Are the airplane-related elements incorporated into the box design proportionally correct and physically rational, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airplane model within Image B aligns proportionally with typical toy airplane designs, retaining a coherent shape without noticeable distortion. The integration within the box, size comparison with the character, and structural form all maintain consistency and physical plausibility reminiscent of standard action figures that often accompany similarly scaled accessories.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character's dynamic pose atop the small airplane wing appear structurally consistent and visually credible, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's pose in Image B exhibits typical characteristics of action figure design where exaggerated stances are common for dramatic effect, such as standing on airplane wings. The pose is dynamic, with outstretched arms implying motion. This reflects a credible design within the context of anime figures, which frequently showcase similar dramatic or exaggerated positioning.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the hyper-realistic figure beside the box rendered realistically and naturally, resembling a professionally photographed product?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B beside the box appears to have a polished, smooth surface typical of high-quality toy figures designed under controlled lighting conditions, aiding in creating realistic representations. The clothing texture and overall finish display a quality consistent with professional product photography, aiming for a realistic portrayal against the plain background.",
