      "question": "Does the transformed texture of the paint splatter maintain a natural appearance without introducing any unnatural artifacts or disrupting the visual flow of the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture previously resembling paint splatter has been transformed into a more geometric and structured design, matching the Art Deco style evidenced by the presence of typical Art Deco elements such as linear motifs and geometric shapes. This transformation introduces elements that are not random or natural, diverging from the organic look of a paint splatter. The visual flow along the guitar aligns well with the New York cityscape backdrop and the overall aesthetic shift, even though it fundamentally changes the natural appearance of the guitar surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the guitar's proportions and physical structure preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural deformation after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The guitar in Image B retains its recognizable shape, with key fractions of its proportions preserved, including the body, neck, and headstock. The new stylized Art Deco designs overlay the original texture but do not overtly disturb its physical structure or proportions, allowing the viewer to discern it as a guitar amidst the external changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the guitar, like strings and pickups, been maintained without any loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, many fine details of the guitar such as strings and pickups are obscured by the bold redesign. The Art Deco pattern overlays could potentially obscure these details, leading to a possible loss of realism or introduction of unnatural textures. While the core shape and parts of the guitar seem preserved, specific details like strings and pickups are either absent or inadequately detailed in the new design style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the new design elements introduced to shift the overall aesthetic align coherently with the chosen concept, avoiding any visual inconsistencies or disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has adopted an Art Deco theme which is characterized by the use of streamlined, symmetrical, and repetitive patterns, typical of the 1920s and 1930s New York aesthetic. The new elements such as geometric decorations and the backdrop of a New York skyline enhance the theme effectively. The holistic presentation aligns with the thematic shift intending to combine music and city culture, showing good visual coherence without apparent inconsistencies or disruptions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the primary title \"NEW YORK Guitar Method\" still clear and legible, without blending into the background or being obscured by the new design elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the primary title 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' remains at the top in a bold, easily legible font against the green background, unaffected by the added decorative elements below. It maintains its strong contrast and prominence, ensuring readability and preventing it from blending into the busier parts of the cover design.",
