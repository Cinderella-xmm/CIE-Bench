    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the Eiffel Towerâ€™s structure preserved with accurate proportions and no geometric distortions despite being scaled down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is enclosed within a glass dome and is represented as a small model. Despite being scaled down, the structure maintains accurate proportions, as one can observe the consistent angles and shapes associated with the original architecture without any evident geometric distortions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, seamless glass dome structure above the scene that fully encloses it without intersecting or distorting any elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the scene within a transparent glass dome. The dome is smoothly rounded and encapsulates the entire scene without breaking or intersecting with internal elements, such as the Eiffel Tower or the figures, ensuring they remain intact and undistorted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snow cover on the ground, trees, and lampposts appear uniformly powdery and free of clumping or artificial texture patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow appears to be evenly distributed across the ground, trees, and lampposts, presenting a fine, powdery texture typical of freshly fallen snow. There are no noticeable clumps or patterns suggesting an artificial appearance, and the snow looks naturally settled.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all human figures proportionally small, anatomically correct (including hands with no more than five fingers), and posed in natural stances without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B are small and proportionate, fitting the scale of the model within the dome. Each figure is posed naturally, with anatomically correct features such as arms and legs, and their hands appear to have the standard five fingers, without any deformity evident.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the streetlamps emit a faint, diffused glow without bright halos or overexposed areas, and are they aligned along the pathway as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlamps emit a subtle, warm glow that softly illuminates the immediate vicinity without producing bright halos or overexposure. They are strategically aligned along the pathways, adding depth to the scene while maintaining their function and aesthetic placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are cobblestone textures visibly embedded beneath the snow along the pathways, showing consistent patterns and fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cobblestone pathways with a layer of snow. Beneath the thin snow cover, the cobblestones are visible, showing a consistent and fine texture pattern that reflects the attention to detail in retaining the surface detail, characteristic of cobblestone paths.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tree branches thin, naturally branched, and lightly dusted with snow without sagging or unnatural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are depicted with thin branches that extend naturally. These branches are lightly dusted with snow, adhering closely to natural snowfall distribution without appearing to sag or accumulate heavily at odd angles, contributing to the realism of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
