      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements (birds and branch) and the new background (starry night sky and moon) appear seamless without any unnatural artifacts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the foreground elements (birds and branch) and the new starry night background is crucial. With effective editing, the birds and branch would be smoothly integrated against the night sky, without noticeable borders or artifacts that suggest they were pasted onto the background. Observing the image, there are no visible artifacts or breaks between these elements and the background, indicating a seamless transition. Therefore, the integration looks natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and lighting of the starry night sky consistent with the rest of the image, and do they not introduce any unnatural artifacts or conflicting light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the starry night sky is a dark blue to black hue, typical of night scenes. Such coloring should complement the rest of the image to maintain consistency and avoid conflicts with the lighting on the birds and branch. The lighting on the birds and branch appears to be coherent, as the edit gives them a cool tone consistent with moonlight, aligning with the night sky without introducing unnatural artifacts or conflicting lights.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the placement and appearance of the new moon natural within the context of the night sky, and does it not appear out of place or overly bright compared to the stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crescent moon is visible in the night sky. For a natural appearance, it should be proportionately sized and not overwhelmingly brighter than the surrounding stars. Image B shows the moon softly illuminating the scene, with a brightness level and position that is fitting among the stars, without seeming excessively luminous or artificial.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the birds retain their detailed features, texture, and proportions after the background change, showing no signs of distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds have been maintained against a new night backdrop. Retaining details such as feather texture and proportions ensures the birds remain realistic-looking, without distortion from edit artifacts. The birds in the image maintain their textured features and look proportionally correct, exhibiting no distortion or detail loss associated with editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tree branch and leaves appear naturally lit and integrate seamlessly with the starry night sky, without any obvious inconsistencies in shadowing or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A natural integration with the starry night sky requires the branch and leaves to exhibit lighting and shadows that are consistent with night conditions. In Image B, the branch and leaves follow a coherent shadow pattern that complements the moonlight and night ambiance, without visible inconsistencies in how they are lit, suggesting a well-executed integration.",
