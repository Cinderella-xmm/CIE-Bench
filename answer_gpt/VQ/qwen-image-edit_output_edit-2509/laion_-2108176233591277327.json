    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a continuous, symmetrical egg-like shape with no visible breaks, jagged edges, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B appears to be a large egg decorated with a colorful phoenix-like design. It maintains a continuous and symmetrical egg shape with smooth contours, which can be judged based on the even surface and rounded top common to egg shapes. By noting the absence of breaks or jagged edges and considering the typical structure of an egg, it suggests intentional design continuity and smoothness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feather-like patterns seamlessly integrated into the surface, with consistent line thickness, shading, and color gradients matching the original level of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question requires examining the feather-like patterns depicted on the egg design. In Image B, the patterns demonstrate consistent line thickness, vibrant shading, and smooth color gradients indicative of high detail, which matches the intricate designs commonly seen in traditional artwork where precision and vibrancy are valued. Visual cues such as the bold outlines and consistent hues further affirm the seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wing-shaped handle smoothly connected to the body of the egg, with realistic feather layers and no visible gaps or distortions in its curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wing-shaped handle in Image B seems to be attached to the egg with a flowing curvature that mirrors feather layers typical of bird wings. By analyzing the seamless attachment and lack of visible gaps or distortions, coupled with the recognizable feather layering, it aligns with realistic interpretations of feather texture and typical structural integrity seen in analogous designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the nest-like rim have a layered, organic structure with consistent material texture and properly placed jewel accents that do not appear displaced or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the nest-like structure around the egg in Image B reveals an apparent layered organic texture that mimics a real nest. The jewel accents, displayed in their specific placements without displacement, reflect an intentional design, further evidenced by their consistent spacing and integration into the nest structureâ€”an adherence to naturalistic design principles without appearing artificial or displaced.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing embers produce a subtle luminous effect that enhances the patterns without causing blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights on adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing embers seen in the nest add a luminous effect to Image B without visible blurring or bleeding into the surrounding patterns. This effect is typical in designs that aim to accentuate rather than distort, supporting this based on the maintaining of vibrant, separate color schemes and outlines despite the glow, confirming a controlled enhancement often pursued to emphasize visual appeal.",
