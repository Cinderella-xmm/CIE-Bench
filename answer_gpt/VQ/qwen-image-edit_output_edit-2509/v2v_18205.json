      "question": "Does the horse's musculature display intricate detail and natural texture without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's musculature is portrayed with significant detail, showcasing realistic textures and fine shading that gives a natural appearance without any obvious digital artifacts. The careful blending and contouring in the painted style help render the horse's form convincingly. My analysis leads to the conclusion that the horse's musculature is detailed and natural without unnatural artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects on the horse and elephant consistent with a Renaissance-inspired style and do they enhance the anatomical features naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents lighting reminiscent of the chiaroscuro technique often seen in Renaissance artworks, where dramatic contrasts between dark and light are used to define forms. The lighting naturally accentuates the horse's musculature and the elephant's features, consistent with the style and enhancing their anatomical details.",

      "question": "Does the elephant's skin retain its natural texture and fine details without any visible degradation or unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant’s skin texture is carefully rendered, showing realistic wrinkles and subtle variations that one would expect in a natural depiction. The fine details are preserved and there is no visible degradation or unnatural patterns detected.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical structure of the horse and elephant appear rational and consistent with their anatomical forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reflects the horse and elephant in rational proportions, consistent with real-life anatomical structures. The horse’s size and muscular build align with its stance on the platform compared to the elephant’s stockier form below, which supports the composition without obvious proportional errors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition of the horse standing on a platform above the elephant visually credible and structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is crafted to portray the horse standing naturally on a platform above the elephant. Despite the fantastical scenario, the structural coherence is maintained with careful positioning and proportions, making the composition visually credible within artistic contexts.",
