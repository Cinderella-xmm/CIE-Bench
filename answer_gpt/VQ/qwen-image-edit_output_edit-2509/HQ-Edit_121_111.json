    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brushstroke effects and color transitions throughout the image smooth and consistent, without visible jagged edges or unnatural smudging in the fur, grass, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke effects in the fur, grass, and sky appear smooth with artistic transitions, typical of digital art. The fur of the squirrel transitions smoothly between colors, and the grass is detailed and consistent with the watercolor style. The sky has a soft gradient, indicating an absence of jagged edges or smudging, thus maintaining uniform texture and color transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the light pink and pale yellow accents on the squirrel’s fur blend seamlessly with the surrounding gray and orange fur, maintaining natural texture and avoiding isolated patches or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The squirrel's fur in Image B features delicate pink and yellow accents that integrate into the natural fur pattern. The colors blend without creating stark contrasts or isolated spots, maintaining a consistent texture across the squirrel’s body. This blending retains the artistic integrity of the image, ensuring no exaggerated highlights disrupt the visual continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wings attached to the squirrel’s back in a position that follows natural shoulder anatomy, with appropriate size and curvature, and do they show consistent shading and transparency matching the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the wings in a manner consistent with the squirrel’s anatomy, positioning them naturally on its back. The wings show a delicate blend of colors and soft shading, consistent with the watercolor style used throughout the rest of the image. They seem to be appropriately sized and curved, providing visual coherence in anatomical accuracy and style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the jewels replacing the acorns have defined facets and reflective surfaces that respond realistically to light, casting appropriate shadows on the grass, and are they sized consistently with the squirrel’s hand and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, jewels have distinct facets, and their surfaces exhibit realistic reflections and shine that suggest an interaction with light. They cast shadows that complement their placement on the grass, maintaining consistent sizing relative to the squirrel’s hand and mouth. This has been illustrated maintaining fidelity to natural interactions with light and shadow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the blurred background a gradual transition from the foreground grass to a soft-focus forest, with no abrupt edges or repeated patterns that suggest artificial blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B transitions gradually from the detailed grass foreground to a soft-focus aesthetic as it moves into the forest-like setting. This transition is smooth, with no sudden edges or patterns indicating artificial manipulation, consistent with the watercolor style, ensuring a natural depth effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text \"The Jewel Gatherer of Whispering Woods\" placed in the sky such that it appears softly integrated with the clouds, with no harsh outlines or unnatural glow, and is it legible without disrupting the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B gently integrates into the cloud backdrop without harsh outlines, maintaining a watercolor-like diffuse effect. It remains legible, allowing it to blend with the sky naturally without creating any visual discord with the background.",
