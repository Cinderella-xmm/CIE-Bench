        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten word 'Draft' seems to be added in a way that matches the color and brightness of the yellow paper with no clear signs of discrepancy in textures. The handwriting style and color do not suggest any unnatural modifications or overlays. Hence, the writing appears to fit naturally within the context of the image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Draft' is written in a style that resembles typical hand-drawn sketches, which matches the context of the image involving a pencil. The font looks like it could be drawn with the pencil present in the image, suggesting a logical consistency with the visual theme of design sketches.",

      "question": "Has the addition of the handwritten word \"Draft\" preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow paper's integrity appears to be intact, with no visible distortion or misalignment caused by the addition of the word 'Draft'. The image does not show any warping or alteration to the shape of the paper, indicating the text addition was done without affecting the paper's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the handwritten word \"Draft\" sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten word 'Draft' in Image B shows clarity in its edges, with no signs of blurring or pixelation that would hint at a low-quality edit. The clarity of the text suggests it was added with an appropriate resolution to match the rest of the image.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word \"Draft\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pencil appears to be correctly positioned on the yellow paper in Image B, as if it was naturally writing or pointing towards where the word 'Draft' is displayed. The addition of the text does not seem to disrupt the perceivable function of the pencil within the image, maintaining a consistent and logical scene context.",
