      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style bird maintain its natural appearance without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style bird has maintained a smooth surface with consistent textures, typical of a chibi or cartoonish adaptation. Its form does not show any visible artifacts or unnatural textures, which would stand out as inconsistencies. Therefore, the bird maintains a natural appearance for a chibi-style depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style lemur in Image B exhibits coherent structure and plausible anatomy typical for a stylized representation. Its limbs, body posture, and facial features are intact and consistent, preserving the appearance of a lemur despite the stylization.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outfits and accessories of the 3D chibi-style characters maintain a consistent style characteristic of chibi art. The details such as the belt, shirt, and watch are clearly depicted and free from visible artifacts or distortions, which would affect their authenticity in a caricature context.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a coherent detail level suitable for a 3D chibi-style image. The absence of unnatural textures or loss of necessary detail across different elements such as the bird, lemur, and microscope contributes to its natural appearance while adhering to the stylized artistic direction.",
