        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure box in Image B is visually analyzed based on common design elements of such merchandise, which typically include clear and even surfaces, consistent text alignment, and bold colors. The box features these elements—straight edges, a bright and consistent color scheme with no visible warping or unnatural surfaces, matching what one would expect from a professionally produced product of this category.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine inside the box retain its proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figurine inside the box is stylized in a way typical of Funko Pop figures, characterized by exaggerated head proportions and simplified features. Based on these standards, the figurine's proportions appear correct, with no visible anomalies or distortions. The head-to-body ratio and the simplicity in facial features are consistent with the artistic style of such figurines, maintaining detail integrity without distortion.",

      "question": "Are the detailed textures and lighting on the realistic figurine outside the box natural and consistent with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and textures of the figurine placed outside the box are matched with the overall lighting source visible in the scene—assuming an indoor, artificial light source as signified by the softness and even distribution of light across objects. This visualization is consistent, showing natural shadows and highlights on the figure, without any mismatches in the surrounding light environment. The textures present are smooth and fit within the context of a realistic product rendering.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the original image and the edited elements seamless, free of unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition from the original image to the edited Funko Pop box and figures seems seamless. There's no evident texture mismatch, and the colors integrate well without abrupt changes in hue or light. Lines between different image elements are smooth, suggesting a seamless composition. The placement and alignment appear intentional and harmonious with the overall scene, without showing signs of jarring addition or lack of cohesion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the Funko Pop figure box and its contents maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the image, without disrupting visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop box and its contents are incorporated in a manner consistent with the theme established by the original skateboarding context. The stylization is deliberately exaggerated yet fits within the universe of toy merchandising, maintaining the credibility associated with Funko Pop displays. Structural consistency is achieved by preserving proportions and a level of detail typical of realistic toy renderings, not detracting from the authenticity of the overall scene.",
