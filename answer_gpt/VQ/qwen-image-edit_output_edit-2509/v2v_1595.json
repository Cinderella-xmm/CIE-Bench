      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain its natural hexagonal pattern and smooth texture after being transformed into a halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball is depicted with the characteristic hexagonal pattern, albeit in a stylized halftone pop-art style. The halftone texture is superimposed, giving it a dotted appearance, but the underlying pattern is consistent with that of an actual soccer ball. Thus, while the smooth texture is altered by the halftone effect, the pattern itself is still recognizable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glittering effects on the goalpost converted into the halftone pop-art style without creating unnatural textures or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glittering effects on the goalpost are stylized using star-like highlights typical of pop-art. The halftone style adds dots throughout the image but retains the essential sparkle effect, ensuring there are no unnatural textures and maintaining the intended visual detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the soccer ball and the goalpost remain consistent and physically plausible after applying the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the soccer ball and the goalpost proportions appear similar to that of a real-life setting, albeit in a pop-art style. The relative sizes are coherent and depict a physically plausible relationship between the ball and the goal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the soccer ball and the netting of the goalpost preserved without distortion in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball retains its typical hexagonal pattern, and the netting of the goalpost displays consistent geometry. Even though the halftone effect abstracts the details slightly, the overall geometric integrity is maintained without evident distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the soccer ball and goalpost maintain visual credibility without introducing obvious artifacts in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B continues to showcase a visually coherent scene with no apparent artifacts disrupting the representation of the soccer ball and goalpost, despite the pop-art stylization. The layout remains credible and the stylistic effects do not impede the visual coherence.",
