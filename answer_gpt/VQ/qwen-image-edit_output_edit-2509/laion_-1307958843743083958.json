    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows two cheetah figures with a golden finish. The surfaces appear smooth and reflective, typical of polished metallic objects. There is no indication of digital artifacting, such as pixelation or disruption in textures, on the figures. This suggests that the gold finish renders naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central glass façade appears as a translucent green object with well-defined, continuous edges. The light transmission is smooth, with no visible distortion or abrupt changes at the boundary, indicating a realistic representation of glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Savanna Essence' on the base of Image B is clear and legible, with sharp edges and a consistent font style. It is correctly positioned on the base of each cheetah figure's pedestal without any signs of blurring or misalignment, ensuring clarity and readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with the original Image A, the cheetah figures maintain the same sitting posture. The anatomical proportions in Image B, such as limb length and torso size, remain consistent without noticeable elongation or compression, ensuring that the figures retain their realistic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two golden cheetah-bottle figures are symmetrically placed on either side of the central green glass structure. The lighting appears consistent as shadows align with the overall directionality of the light source and surface reflections, indicating a coherent setup.",
