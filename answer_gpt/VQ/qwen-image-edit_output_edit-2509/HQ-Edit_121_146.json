    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass candle chamber appears to have a consistent transparency that one would expect from natural glass. The light interacts realistically with the surface, demonstrating proper refraction. The embossed gold floral motifs are clearly defined and maintain a sharp, detailed appearance without any signs of distortion or unnatural textures typically seen in poorly executed digital edits.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camel red hue of the glass candle chamber evenly distributed and visually harmonious with the surrounding silver and gold elements, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The camel red hue in Image B is uniformly distributed across the glass candle chamber, creating a visually pleasing and harmonious effect with the surrounding silver and gold elements. There is no evident abrupt color shift or unnatural saturation, indicating a well-balanced color integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the wooden lid accurately reflect the contour and curvature of the original teapot handle, and does it display natural wood grain and polish without visible artifacts or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden lid mimics the original teapot handle's contour and curvature convincingly. The surface of the lid displays natural wood grain and polish, consistent with realistic wood materials, and lacks any visible artifacts, geometric distortions, or atypical markings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned on the base in a way that aligns with the existing decorative elements, and does it lack jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast that would suggest digital insertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand logo in Image B is seamlessly integrated onto the base, aligning well with the existing decorative elements, such as patterns and curves. There are no jagged edges, misalignment issues, or unnatural contrast, indicating a convincing insertion into the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the newly added patterned fabric background exhibit consistent texture, proper lighting interaction, and seamless integration with the teapot's shadow and reflection on the surface below, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterned fabric background shows a consistent texture and interacts with the lighting suitably, casting the correct shadows and seamlessly integrating with the teapot's reflection and shadow on the surface. There are no visible seams or lighting inconsistencies that would suggest poor digital manipulation.",
