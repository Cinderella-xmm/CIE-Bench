    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines are meant to enhance the comic style by providing definition to the shapes. Though they generally trace the main elements like the player, basketball, hoop, and court, there are minor instances where they overlap or cut into the forms slightly due to the intricate detailing required for dynamic comic designs. Such overlaps are part of stylistic comic imprecision rather than errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the player’s body or the basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dynamic action lines are designed to emphasize movement, mimicking comic panel effects. These lines generally radiate outward from the subjects, avoiding intersections with solid objects like the player's body or the basketball, thus maintaining the clarity of motion without disrupting the central imagery.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red and orange hues applied consistently across the image without causing visible color bleeding, banding, or loss of detail in areas such as the jersey fabric, skin tone, or wooden floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Among comic-style rendering, the vibrant hues like red and orange often feature bold contrast but can lead to color bleeding or loss in detail. Image B maintains the detail in the jersey, skin tone, and floor while applying these hues, demonstrating controlled color application without noticeable bleeding or loss in intricate details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text overlay clearly legible, positioned outside the main subject area, and not covering any essential part of the player or basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text overlay in Image B is clearly legible and strategically positioned to complement the image without obstructing crucial areas — such as the player or basketball. It follows a typical comic layout precedence by integrating dynamic typography alongside imagery elements without distraction.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the comic panel border evenly drawn around the entire image, maintaining consistent thickness and not cropping any part of the player, hoop, or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a comic-style border around the illustration. The border appears evenly applied without cropping significant elements like the player, hoop, or audience in the background, indicating proper framing without unintended cuts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the basketball in Image B is visually correct with five fingers, all proportional and naturally curved around the sphere. This alignment is critical for depicting realism within a comic style, and Image B has adhered to anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball maintains a spherical shape crucial for realistic portrayal enhanced by visible seam lines, typical in such comic illustrations. There are no apparent distortions, ensuring it visually aligns with the expected standard of roundness seen in basketballs.",
