    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style elephant maintain its identifiable traits like tusks and large ears without any unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style elephant is depicted as a cute, cartoonish version of an elephant which typically retains recognizable features such as large ears and tusks. From the visual cues, the elephant has large, floppy ears and visible tusks, and these features are consistent with how elephants are generally represented in a simplified or cartoonish style. Therefore, there are no unnatural distortions seen in the key features of the elephant.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures and fine details of the elephant's skin accurately represented in the chibi-style 3D rendering without any loss or unnatural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In the chibi-style 3D rendering of the elephant, the skin appears smooth and lacks the intricate texture that a real elephant has, which is typical for this style focused on simplicity and cuteness. This choice does not translate to a loss or unnatural appearance since the chibi style inherently does not strive for hyper-realism, focusing instead on exaggerated form and features that convey character simply and endearingly.",
