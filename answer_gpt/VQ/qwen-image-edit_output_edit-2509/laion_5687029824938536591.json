      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe clearly defined and aligned correctly, without warped edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe are well-defined with clean and distinct lines. They are aligned properly and do not show any signs of distortion, such as warped edges or segments being missing. This is consistent with a well-crafted wooden sculpture where attention to detail in replicating such patterns is crucial. The original Image A features standard triangular overlays typical of this shoe model, and the edited image maintains fidelity to this design, confirming the precision in the wooden representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wood grain lines flow naturally across the shoe's surface, following the contours of the panels and laces, without repeating or pixelated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood grain lines are visible throughout the shoe's surface, seamlessly following the contours of the panels and laces. They exhibit a natural and fluid appearance without any noticeable repeating patterns or pixelation. This suggests a careful and detailed representation of wood, where the laces and panels bear realistic grain patterns, enhancing the sculpture’s authenticity. No evidence suggests disruptions or unnatural textures in the grain, indicating a coherent and realistic depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the laces depicted as solid wooden strands with consistent width and proper threading through the eyelets, maintaining their original path and tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laces in Image B appear as solid wooden strands that maintain a consistent width throughout their length. They are correctly threaded through the eyelets, preserving the original path and tension one would expect from a standard lace. Unlike a fabric lace, these wooden laces are rendered with a smooth, unvaried texture that successfully mimics wooden craftsmanship while maintaining the lace's original design and path as seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the darker and lighter wood tones create a clear distinction between the shoe's main body and highlights, such as the toe cap and midsole, without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable and effective use of darker and lighter wood tones that emphasize the shoe's structure and form. The transitions between these tones are smooth, without abrupt or unnatural color shifts, supporting a realistic depiction of wood. These tones help to delineate different parts of the shoe, such as the toe cap and midsole, maintaining clarity and authenticity in the wood sculpture as compared to Image A, where color highlights define the same segments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brand names and logos (e.g., \"Salomon\", \"Speedcross\", \"Contagrip\") clearly readable and accurately positioned on the shoe, with clean edges and no blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an attempt to replicate the brand names and logos, but given the wooden material, these are not as sharp or clear as they are in Image A, where they appear printed on a fabric. Inherent in a wooden sculpture, fine text details would be challenging to achieve. Therefore, while some logos seem visible and in the correct general areas, they lack the crispness and clarity found on the original shoe. This means that the accuracy and readability are compromised, likely due to the chosen medium of representation.",

      "question": "Does the outsole feature deep, well-defined treads and a reinforced toe cap, with consistent depth and spacing that matches the original shoe’s geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outsole displays a well-structured and defined pattern of deep treads, mimicking the geometry of the original shoe model as seen in Image A. The toe cap also demonstrates reinforcement consistent with the original design. The depth and spacing of the treads on the see-through outsole replicate the original's functional design effectively, barring any irregularities which proves that the shoe’s sculpture maintains its athletic and rugged appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden shoe placed on a clean, flat shelf with soft shadows beneath it, suggesting a stable and realistic display environment without floating or misaligned positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe is placed on a clearly defined, flat surface with smooth, soft shadows cast beneath it, indicating stable placement. This shadowing effect makes it appear convincingly grounded rather than floating or improperly aligned, creating a realistic display setting. The flat shelf enhances the perception of it being a display piece, as opposed to Image A where context of placement is secondary to the focus on product details.",
