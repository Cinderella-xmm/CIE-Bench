    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs appear to be constructed using LEGO bricks. The LEGO bricks in the image show characteristics typical of these toy bricks: uniform size and clean, interlocking edges. There are no visible breaks or misalignments that can be seen, which suggests that they have been digitally rendered with attention to detail. From the visual cues, it's reasonable to conclude that Image B does depict table and chairs made from uniformly sized LEGO bricks without visible imperfections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distinct LEGO textures, characterized by the familiar stud patterns on the table and chairs. The stud patterns are consistent and regular, which is typical of LEGO bricks. Additionally, no stretching or distortion of the bricks is evident, indicating the edited image maintains the natural proportions and textures standard in LEGO brick constructions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central element presents a LEGO-style plant crafted from green LEGO bricks which show recognizable leaf shapes. Observing the placement, the plant appears to be centrally positioned directly on the table's surface. There is no overlap or floating indicated, suggesting proper alignment and rendering within the scene depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the furniture resting on a gray LEGO baseplate. The baseplate appears snug beneath the table and chairs, well within the edges, which implies that it was rendered to match the layout of the LEGO furniture. However, it's clear that there is a seam visible between the LEGO baseplate and the real ground, indicating the baseplate does not blend seamlessly with the real environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B for potential artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture, there appears to be a clean integration with the background. The shadows and lighting do not present as unnatural, and there is no obvious pixelation or jagged edges. This careful rendering indicates thorough digital editing and complete integration with the background setting of the image.",
