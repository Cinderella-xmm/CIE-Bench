    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
    "explanation": "The brass finishes on the ship are essential for conveying a high-quality appearance. In Image B, the brass is visible and seems to be uniform in color and texture without cracks or pixelation, indicating a high level of craftsmanship in the rendered model. The color appears consistent across surfaces, and it aligns with typical polished brass finishes seen in real-world objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
    "explanation": "The metal automatons are designed to mimic human figures. In Image B, these figures are clearly articulated with limbs, and while visible details such as clothing are not explicitly seen, the shape and posture are consistent with typical human proportions, suggesting proper articulation and clothing conformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
    "explanation": "For a glass lantern to appear realistic, transparency and structural integrity should be evident. In Image B, the glass sides of the lantern enclosure appear well-defined with visible metal framing that supports the structure. There are no visual errors or missing parts, and the framing appears continuous around the glass.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
    "explanation": "Steam clouds should be depicted with soft transitions and realistic floatation. In Image B, the steam clouds appear smoothly blended and naturally positioned within the scene. The edges of the steam are soft, and the color consistency matches typical steam appearance without abrupt transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
    "explanation": "By investigating the placement of compasses and flags in relation to the ship's structure and dock, appropriate orientation and proportion are analyzed. In Image B, these elements are placed logically and in a proportionate manner that fits the spatial context of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "For mechanical components to appear as integrated parts of the ship, their attachment and placement must be coherent with the structure's contour. In Image B, while specific gears and supports are not distinctly highlighted, the components align with the vessel's hull and deck, indicating proper integration without floating or intersection errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
