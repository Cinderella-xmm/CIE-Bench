        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas such as the chinrest and tailpiece show gold accents. Observing closely, these accents appear integrated seamlessly without obvious seams or gaps.

      "question": "Is the scripted font along the strings clearly legible, aligned with string curvature, and free from distortion or floating effects that suggest digital overlay errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a scripted font on the case's interior lid rather than directly on the strings. The script 'Bespokie Muiment Series' is clear, legible, and does not show distortion or floating effects. It's aligned flatly against the case lid rather than interacting with the string curvature, indicating proper digital integration without errors.",
