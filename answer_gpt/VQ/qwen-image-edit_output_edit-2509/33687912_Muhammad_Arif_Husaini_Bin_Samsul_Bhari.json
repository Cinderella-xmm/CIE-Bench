      "question": "Does the shell-like body of the creature have consistent curvature and smooth surface transitions without visible cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell-like body has a smooth and consistent curvature with no visible cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes. The shell appears artistically styled with smooth transitions and a harmonious design. This suggests a professional and intentional enhancement to match a stylized, fantasy aesthetic. The consistent design indicates it was drawn or edited with care to maintain its cohesive appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the coral-like spires distributed organically along the back of the creature, with varying heights and irregular shapes that resemble natural coral formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows coral-like spires that are distributed in an organic and asymmetrical manner. They appear with varying heights and irregular shapes that mimic the diversity found in natural coral formations. This design choice enhances the fantasy effect, aiming to replicate the appearance of coral seen in marine life, suggesting intentionality in their portrayal.",

      "question": "Do the glowing sea guardian spirits emit soft, diffused light that originates from their bodies and does not produce sharp halos or isolated bright spots outside their forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing sea guardian spirits appear to emit a gentle, diffused light that stays primarily within the boundaries of their figures. There are no sharp halos or isolated bright spots, suggesting a soft glow effect consistent with fantasy illustrations of mystical or ethereal creatures, highlighting artistic attention to maintaining the visual cohesiveness and aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flow smoothly in the same direction as the original wake, with colors transitioning gradually from warm orange to deep red matching the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent wave pattern is depicted with bright, colorful waves that flow artistically rather than mimicking the natural pattern seen in Image A. The colors include a diverse palette that doesn't directly match the sky's warm orange to deep red gradient and instead stand out as visually distinct and vibrant. This distinguishes them as a fantastical element rather than an attempt to mimic natural water behavior or colors.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature cast a faint shadow on the water surface beneath it, and are its illuminated parts consistent with the direction of sunlight from the setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic depiction of the creature and surrounding lights does not show a naturalistic interaction with the environment, such as casting realistic shadows corresponding to a setting sun. The illuminated parts appear styled independently from natural light sources, highlighting a fantastical or illustrative approach where physical consistency takes a backseat to aesthetic expression.",
