      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the castle icon used for the HOMEPAGE positioned centrally and sized proportionally to fit within the original white rounded rectangle area without overlapping nearby elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "First analyzing Image B, the castle icon for HOMEPAGE is located at the top center and appears to be the central theme. It's proportionately sized and does not appear to overlap the nearby login, search, and blog buttons. The area seems well-organized with ample space allocated for the castle icon. Comparing this with Image A, where the central rectangle is used to denote the HOMEPAGE, the position and proportional fit of the castle in the edited image aligns with the intended central layout seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the connection lines between the HOMEPAGE and main sections (e.g., PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US) transformed into smooth, winding trails with no broken segments or irregular widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the connections have shifted from straight lines to winding trails. The trails are smooth with consistent widths and show a playful, fantasy design. The visual matches a natural winding path without any broken segments or irregularities. Examining Image A, straight connection lines are used to link the homepage with various sections, which are now creatively reimagined in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the icon replacing \"PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS\" clearly visible, properly aligned within the orange rounded rectangle, and appropriately scaled so it doesn't extend beyond the border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, icons depict the sections rather than textual names. The icon replacing 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS' is within an orange rounded rectangle, clearly visible and appropriately scaled, not extending past its designated area. Image A uses an all-text representation, with 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS' contained within similar rounded shapes. The fit and visibility match well between the two images, despite design alterations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (e.g., trees, creatures) placed along the winding trails in gaps between nodes and do they have smooth outlines and consistent coloring without jagged edges or noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates decorative elements like trees and creatures placed along the trails between sections. These are colorful, smoothly outlined, and nestled in spaces between the paths, adding to the fantasy theme. The overall aesthetic shows consistent coloring without visual artifacts like jagged edges or noise. Image A lacks these fantasy elements, focusing solely on site architecture, highlighting the creative addition in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the text in the blue rounded rectangles (e.g., \"News\", \"Events\") use a consistent, bold, child-friendly font that remains fully contained within the bounds of each shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text within blue rounded rectangles uses a bold, readable, and child-friendly font that fits fully within the boundaries of each shape. Visual accuracy implies thoughtful design choices tailored for clarity. Image A employs a formal, standard font consistent with professional site architecture, contrasting with the playful design in the edited version.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the different levels of the site map (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) still visually separable based on color coding or size differences, despite the change in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reviewing Image B, the site map levels are distinguished by color coding and varied icon sizes, maintaining visual separation despite stylistic changes. The separation approach aligns with Image A's use of intensity and size differences to denote hierarchy. The transition maintains the distinction between map levels seamlessly.",
