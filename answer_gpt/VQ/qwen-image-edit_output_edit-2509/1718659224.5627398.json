    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the fortress walls and towers exhibit a uniform golden-brown cookie dough texture with darker edges that match the lighting direction and do not show unnatural pixelation or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a structure resembling a fortress made from cookie dough. The texture is consistent throughout, with a uniform golden-brown appearance that resembles baked cookie dough. The edges are darker, enhancing the effect of lighting, which is typical when light strikes an object, creating darker outlines due to shadows. The shading is consistent and follows the lighting direction without showing pixelation or inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls rendered as smooth, continuous streams of royal icing that follow the natural contour of the cliff and show appropriate sheen and thickness without appearing clumped or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfalls are represented as streams of royal icing cascading down the model's contour. The icing streams maintain smoothness and continuity, following the surface naturally without interruptions or breaks. The sheen and thickness of the icing are appropriate, resembling how royal icing would appear when freshly applied, without clumping.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees formed from green marzipan positioned naturally on the terrain, maintaining plausible size and shape without appearing compressed, misshapen, or disconnected from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B look like they are crafted from green marzipan. They are located throughout the terrain, with a plausible size that complements the rest of the cookie-based structure. The shapes are consistent with real foliage, and they are correctly anchored, appearing naturally connected to the ground without disconnection or distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white ceramic platter clearly visible beneath the cookie fortress, extending outward with clean edges and casting a soft shadow that aligns with the light source, without appearing to float or distort the surrounding terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a white ceramic platter beneath the cookie fortress, clearly visible and extending outward with defined edges. A soft shadow is cast from the platter, consistent with the light source's direction seen in the image. The platter does not appear to float or distort the surroundings but provides a stable base for the fortress model.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, texture discontinuities, or abrupt transitions between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees that suggest poor blending or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the integration between elements—the cookie fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees—appears seamless. There are no visible seams or abrupt transitions, and textures blend smoothly without discontinuity. This suggests that the elements are well-rendered without errors in blending or integration.",
