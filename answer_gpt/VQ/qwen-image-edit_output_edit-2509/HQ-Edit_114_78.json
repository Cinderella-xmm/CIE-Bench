      "question": "Does the key maintain its original geometric shape and proportions when transformed into a bridge, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key has been creatively transformed into a bridge that connects two land areas. To assess whether the key maintains its original geometric shape and proportions, I examine the shape of the key in Image B, notably the bit, which appears to consistently serve as the bridge section. Despite the context change, the central portion retains the detailed patterns seen in the original key from Image A, without any evident distortion or stretching. The transition preserves the key's intricate design properties while ingeniously repurposing one section as a bridge.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny houses and trees positioned in a way that aligns with the wood grain’s depth and surface plane, without floating or appearing disconnected from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny houses and trees are integrated into the scene in a way that suggests solid footing on the carved wooden hills. By examining their placement and shading, it's apparent they are grounded on the elevated wooden structures that appear to be cut from or placed upon a box canvas representing a landscape. They do not appear to be floating, as they are firmly rooted within the carved wooden landscape, thus aligning with the surface plane.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the resin river emerge smoothly from the key’s bit and flow with consistent material properties, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the resin river originates from the key's bit which serves as a bridge. I observe that the river flows out consistently along its path without interruptions. The coloration remains a continuous bright bluish hue, suggesting a natural water-like appearance. There is no sharpness or abrupt color transition that would denote an unnatural shift, showcasing its seamless integration in the miniature landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boundary of the key case clearly defined and consistent with the wood grain and metallic tones of the key, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the key encased within a box-like structure that contains the miniature landscape. The edge of the case aligns visibly with both the wooden texture and metallic tones. The case boundaries are well-defined, with a coherent texture throughout and a consistent lighting effect that matches the overall aesthetic seen in the elements within. There are no perceptible abrupt transitions in texture or lighting between the case and its surrounding features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carved wooden hill seamlessly blended into the surrounding wood grain, with consistent texture and shading that suggests natural carving rather than digital patching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden hill in Image B appears smoothly integrated within the miniature environment, with its texture and shading naturally continuing from the surrounding landscape. The wood grain from the carved features complements that of the base or canvas where they are placed, providing a convincing illusion of naturally carved wood rather than digitally inserted elements. This seamless integration suggests careful crafting and blending rather than patching.",
