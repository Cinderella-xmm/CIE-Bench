    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the seed packet in the gnome’s left hand proportionally sized and properly aligned with the hand, showing no signs of floating or unnatural attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging features a drawing of a gnome holding flowers, similar to the object in Image A. Analyzing the packet drawing, it appears proportionally sized, fitting the context of the package design without signs of misalignment or floating. The packet behaves appropriately within its context visualization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the faux soil and botanical illustrations at the base of the gnome seamlessly integrated, showing natural texture and proper alignment with the ground plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faux soil and botanical illustrations are part of a packaging design. World knowledge of packaging suggests that such elements are graphically integrated elements, thus they are meant to appear seamless and flatter, rather than realistic soil texture in three-dimensional space. As per packaging graphics, they appear naturally aligned within their intended plane without signs of misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the seed bombs in both hands have a natural spherical shape with appropriate surface texture and fit securely within the gnome’s hands without distorting finger positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seed bombs shown in Image B are not held by the gnome but are presented at the bottom right of the packaging design. Their shape is spherical and such a representation in marketing or design is expected to not distort any physical human-like hand, as these elements are independent of any hand depiction or comparison.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the earthy textures applied to the seed packet, seed bombs, soil, and illustrations consistent in style and free from visible artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the packaging and its elements (seed packet, seed bombs, soil) maintain a consistent earthy texture that fits the theme. The design choices appear intentional and unified, without any visible pixelation or shading abnormalities which might detract from a cohesive style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the edited image balanced and structured like a product package, with all elements arranged in a logical and non-cluttered manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows a designed product packaging where elements like the seed packet, faux soil, botanical illustrations, and seed bombs are logically arranged to showcase the product. Packaging design principles include balance, structure, and clarity, which are apparent in Image B as all elements are positioned purposefully and without clutter.",
