    "Question": "Q1: Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features intricate golden batik patterns. To assess whether these patterns are clearly defined and free from digital artifacts, I examine their edges for continuity and smoothness. The patterns appear to have smooth, uninterrupted lines without pixelation or jagged edges, which indicates high-quality definition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
    "explanation": "In the line-drawn version (Image B), the temple's tiers and structural symmetry can be analyzed by looking at their alignment and consistency. Each tier aligns symmetrically and matches the original shadowed structure in terms of position and proportion, suggesting no missing or distorted roof layers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
    "explanation": "To determine if the statues are identical, I consider their pose, size, and placement relative to the temple's central axis in Image B. Both statues appear to mirror each other in terms of pose and dimensions, maintaining symmetry on both sides of the pathway leading to the temple.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do both of the dancerâ€™s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's hands are examined for anatomical correctness, specifically the number of fingers and their spacing. Each hand displays five fingers with smooth contours and natural spacing, indicating no deformities or additional fingers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
    "explanation": "The placement and readability of the text in Image B are analyzed by observing its position relative to the central elements like the dancer, temple, and statues. The text is placed above and around the temple, ensuring it does not overlap or obscure these elements, and it is legibly arranged, minimizing visual clutter.",
    "answer": "Yes"
