    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is visually clear and presents a smooth surface, typical of well-crafted glass objects. The eagle and clouds seen through the dome are not distorted, suggesting effective rendering of transparency and light refraction. The dome's curvature is gentle, supporting its realistic appearance. This is discerned through the typical qualities of glass seen in real-world applications combined with understanding of how light passes through transparent objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases miniature clouds beneath the eagle's wings that possess a rounded, three-dimensional form which is similar to natural cumulus clouds. The lighting is consistent with what would naturally illuminate clouds, contributing to their realism. The visual texture of the clouds matches typical cloud formations seen in nature, which supports their believability and alignment within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf detail is placed delicately on the clouds, showing reflective qualities that are characteristic of metallic textures. The application does not disturb the integrity of the clouds and avoids creating overly bright or harsh highlights. This balance of metallic texture and cloud appearance is assessed based on common knowledge of gold leaf's reflective properties and how it can be effectively incorporated into artistic designs without disrupting underlying textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a base of dark wood that features a natural texture, visible through subtle grain lines, and a polished finish that enhances its aesthetic value. The engraved text is clear and precise, showing craftsmanship. The base is also proportional to the dome, implying stability and continuity in design, evaluated through familiarity with woodwork and proportional design principles applied in similar objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the compass roses are placed around the wood base evenly, maintaining symmetry that is often desired in decorative elements. Their shape is accurate to typical classic compass rose designs, and the brass material shows realistic metallic texture. The scale of these elements in relation to the dome and base is appropriate, ensuring they enhance rather than overpower the overall scene, inferred through knowledge of brass material properties and design balance principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
