      "question": "Does the white horse maintain its natural texture and lighting, integrating seamlessly into the new forest background without showing any unnatural contrasts or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted with a consistent texture that blends harmoniously with the forest background. The lighting on the horse appears natural, with shadows that are coherent with the position and direction of the sunlight filtering through the trees. There are no signs of abrupt contrasts, suggesting the horse is well-integrated into the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added forest and tree elements visually consistent with the horse's presence, and does the sunlight streaming through the trees create natural highlights and shadows on the horse without unnatural disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest and tree elements are consistent with the horse's presence. The sunlight creates highlights and shadows on the horse that appear natural and in line with the light source above. There are no visual disruptions or inconsistencies in how the light interacts with the horse and the surroundings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hooves of the horse appear to interact naturally with the forest floor, such as showing realistic mud or leaves, and are there any visible artifacts where the grass meets the new forest ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's hooves appear to interact naturally with the forest floor, suggesting contact with the ground. The transition between the grass and forest ground looks seamless, with no visible artifacts or signs of artificial manipulation, which indicates a convincing integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the horse's body correctly simulate sunlight filtering through the trees and casting shadows from surrounding forest elements, without any unnatural bright spots or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting across the horse's body accurately simulates the effect of dappled sunlight filtering through the forest canopy. The shadows and highlights correspond to the wooded environment, without any unnatural bright spots or dark patches that might suggest artificial lighting or editing errors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the horseâ€™s leap look structurally coherent with the new forest setting, with appropriate motion blur and a trajectory that suggests a natural leap from within the shadows without any geometric distortions or visual incongruities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's leaping pose looks structurally coherent with the forest setting. The trajectory and positioning are natural, and there are no geometric distortions or incongruities in the leap. The absence of motion blur is consistent with the apparent stillness of the moment captured, maintaining a realistic depiction.",
