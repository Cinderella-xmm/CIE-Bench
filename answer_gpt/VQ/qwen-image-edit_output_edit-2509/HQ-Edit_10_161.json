      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress displays geometric patterns that appear continuous and well-preserved, without any noticeable distortions or misalignments. The visual cues suggest that these shapes retain their intended geometry without interruptions or irregularities. Compared to Image A, where the patterns are naturally aligned and continuous, Image B maintains the integrity of the patterns without any noticeable deviations.",

      "question": "Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the necklace as composed of flat, stained glass-like tiles with vibrant and consistent color gradients. The tiles appear smooth and homogeneous without any jagged, pixelated edges, which supports the idea of a refined stained glass design. In contrast to Image A, where the necklace is made of beads that have a more textured and rounded appearance, Image B transforms this necklace into a glass mosaic structure while keeping it visually clean and rich in detail.",

      "question": "Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids remain individually distinguishable and maintain proportional accuracy. They show smooth transitions between segments, ensuring clear separation and robust structure. These braids retain their form without collapsing or fusing. When compared with Image A, the braids are naturally segmented with distinct separation and consistency, and Image B preserves these qualities well.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features textured landscapes with elevation changes that seem intentional and artistically rendered. Although the landscape appears stylized, it showcases variation and depth in colors and textures without uniform patches or unnatural blending. Image A displays a natural terrain backdrop that is more straightforward, while Image B uses artistic elements to create a rich visual experience that transcends realism but remains believable.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bracelets as symmetrically positioned on both arms, matching their corresponding locations and numbers as seen in Image A. The visual quality is maintained, with no distortion, stretching, or overlapping evident in either image. Image B keeps these accessories consistent and harmonious, reflecting a careful attention to detail in terms of placement and integrity.",
