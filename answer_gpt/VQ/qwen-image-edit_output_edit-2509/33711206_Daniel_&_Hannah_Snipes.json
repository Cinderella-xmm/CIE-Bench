      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the eyes of both the woman and child appear proportionate to their facial structures. In illustrations or stylized images, features like eyes can be exaggerated, yet still maintain facial harmony without distortion. Here, the eyes are aligned well and don't show unnatural spacing or distortion. Comparing with Image A, which features realistic human proportions, Image B’s stylized elements (like possible enlargement) still fit naturally within the facial designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands of the woman and child show five fingers each, with natural finger curvature and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the woman and child display hands with five fingers each, and they are depicted with natural curvature, appropriate lengths, and no overlapping fingers or missing digits. This reflects an understanding of human anatomy in art. Comparing with Image A, which also displays naturally positioned fingers, Image B’s representation maintains realism in stylization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents color transitions that are smooth between the woman's dress, child's dress, and the floral background. These transitions are consistent with artistic techniques that aim for harmony and fluidity in illustrations. There are no obvious digital or unnatural edges. Comparing with Image A’s natural setting and shading, Image B maintains artistic coherence without harsh transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral accents appear consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the rest of the illustration. The added flowers blend seamlessly with the existing elements and are coherent in stylization. While shadows in the drawing are often not realistic, they should conceptually align with the visual aesthetic. Image B’s shadows match the style. Unlike Image A’s natural elements and lighting, Image B opts for stylized coherence, making the floral accents fit effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden border have uniform thickness, natural wood grain, and proper alignment with the image edges without gaps or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a wooden border around the illustration that exhibits uniform thickness and alignment. The wood grain looks natural, contributing to a polished presentation without gaps or warping. The border complements the image, akin to traditional framing techniques. Image A doesn’t feature a border, but Image B’s addition adheres to concepts of framing artwork.",
