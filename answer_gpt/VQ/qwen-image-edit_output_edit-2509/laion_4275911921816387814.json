    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the silver-gray fabric on the blade retain the original blade's curved shape and pattern details without distortion or loss of fine lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the fabric on the blade does follow the curved shape of Image A's blade, maintaining a similar curve concept. However, the fabric's pattern appears simplified compared to the intricate details found in Image A's design, indicating a loss of fine pattern details. Therefore, the retention of intricate pattern details is not fully achieved, suggesting some distortion or loss compared to the original.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the edges of the hilt smoothly rounded and consistent in curvature, without abrupt flattening or irregular bulges suggesting poor volume shaping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hilt shows smooth, rounded edges consistent throughout, implying good volume shaping without noticeable flattening or bulges. This assessment is congruent with normal expectations for stuffed objects shaped for aesthetic uniformity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blade’s tip preserved as a pointed, slightly curved end without drooping or flattening due to over-stuffing or under-support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's blade ends in a more rounded tip, lacking the sharpness and slight curvature seen in the blade of Image A. This suggests that the tip does not retain the pointed shape effectively due to the nature of the soft material which tends to appear rounded and less defined.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the black embroidered patterns uniformly spaced and aligned along the blade’s length, matching the original engraving’s density and symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embroidered patterns are spaced and distributed over the blade's length. However, they do not closely match the detailed, uniform density and symmetry of the original engraving found in Image A. The fabric's embroidery appears uneven compared to the consistent and dense engraving patterns in Image A, showing a difference in alignment and consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a consistent, flat solid color without visible gradients, shadows, or texture that could imply improper rendering or compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background with a solid, flat color without any visible gradients, shadows, or textures. This creates a clean and consistent backdrop, suggesting proper rendering without compositional flaws.",
