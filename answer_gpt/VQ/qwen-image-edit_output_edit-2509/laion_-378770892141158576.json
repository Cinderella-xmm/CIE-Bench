      "question": "Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe on the seated figure has a smooth appearance, with folds and draping that follow the body's contours naturally. This can be observed by the way the robe rests on the body and the ground, suggesting a flowy fabric. The absence of clumping or unnatural stretching supports this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seated figureâ€™s limbs and joints are portrayed in a cartoonish manner, especially since it features exaggerated eyes which is common in caricature styles. This artistic choice can lead to some anatomical distortion. However, the limbs do not exhibit severe distortion in angles or lengths that break the cartoon's stylistic element. As the figure is cartoonish yet proportionate within its style, the limbs appear to be in line with this approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the seated figure are drawn in a typical cartoon or caricature style, where large eyes can be a stylistic choice. While the eyes are significantly larger than normal human proportions, they are proportionally integrated within the cartoon character's face. The surrounding facial features accommodate the large eyes without appearing distorted, maintaining the artistic cohesion.",

      "question": "Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain and lake reflections are illustrated with a style that suggests soft, blended watercolor transitions. The colors blend smoothly without the presence of sharp edges or harsh lines, which helps create an impressionistic feel typical in watercolor paintings.",

      "question": "Is the lilac-edged border uniformly applied around the image without overlapping or obscuring any part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a lilac-edged border uniformly surrounding each image within the album page. It maintains a consistent width and does not overlap or obscure the depicted scenes. The border frames each section cleanly, adhering to the boundaries of the images inside.",
