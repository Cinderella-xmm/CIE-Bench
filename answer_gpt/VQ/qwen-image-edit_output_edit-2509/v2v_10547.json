      "question": "Does the squirrel appear to have the same textured brushstroke style as the rest of the painting, avoiding unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel has been integrated into the scene with a brushstroke texture that matches the swirling patterns typical of Van Gogh's style seen throughout the painting. The texture and brushstroke technique are consistent with the original aesthetic, emphasizing the hand-painted look without introducing any starkly different or unnatural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the addition of the squirrel maintain the structural consistency of the painting without breaking the flow of the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the squirrel is placed in the foreground where it seems naturally integrated, allowing the background of swirling skies and the village structures to remain intact and unchanged. This positioning maintains the composition and does not disturb the landscape's flow, as the squirrel complements the perspective and depth rather than interrupting it.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the squirrel's size relative to the surrounding elements appropriate, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scale of the squirrel in Image B is proportionate to the other elements such as the trees and buildings, though slightly larger due to its place in the foreground which creates a natural perspective. This size choice supports a coherent depiction without exaggerated distortion, maintaining a realistic scaling in relation to the background elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details around the squirrel, such as the grass and tree, preserved without any noticeable degradation or loss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the details surrounding the squirrel, including those of the grass and tree it stands next to, are preserved and maintain their intricate brushstroke style in harmony with the entire painting. No significant loss of detail or degradation occurs, reflecting care in updating the image that retains the original texture and detail.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the squirrel's placement in the foreground complement the composition of the painting without introducing any visual anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In considering Image B, the squirrel is positioned in the foreground, enhancing the composition by adding a focal point without obstructing other elements or causing visual imbalance. Its placement is well-considered to maintain the overall harmony and dynamic of the artwork, devoid of introducing any visual anomalies that could distract from the main scene.",
