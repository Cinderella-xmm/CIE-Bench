    "Question": "Q1: Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body has been transformed into crystal, specifically quartz and obsidian. The edited image portrays the cat with intact shape and proportions similar to those in Image A. The body maintains the original silhouette and proportions, with rounded features and a seated pose, which suggests careful consideration was applied to preserve these qualities during the transformation into crystals.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes have been transformed into emerald crystals. These eyes maintain consistent positioning within the eye sockets and have retained their original size and shape compared to Image A. The reflective qualities are somewhat exaggerated due to the crystal material, but they remain proportionately correct and well placed, matching the original facial structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the cat sitting with its front paws and hind legs positioned properly on the wooden block. The paws are clearly resting on top of the block without any floating or disconnected segments. This positioning aligns with the natural logic and consistency observed in Image A, indicating that the transformation into crystal did not alter the cat's pose inappropriately.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates the quartz and obsidian surfaces of the cat with realistic textures and variations. The crystals exhibit translucent qualities typical of these materials, along with shading and edge definitions that contribute to a believable representation. There is no evident pixelation or unnatural smoothness; instead, the image maintains high-quality detail and texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block bears consistent texture, color, and lighting as observed in Image A. The block in the edited image casts appropriate shadows underneath the crystal cat, which blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, reinforcing the natural consistency and avoiding any gaps or distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
