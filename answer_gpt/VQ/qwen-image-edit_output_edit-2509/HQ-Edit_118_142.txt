    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is transformed into a pop-up style with small figurines standing on its pages. The transformation appears well-executed, with consistent proportions; the pages open up naturally, and the elements within the book are proportional and appropriately placed. There are no visually warped edges or elements that appear to be unnaturally floating, which suggests thoughtful design and structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the quill positioned centrally and vertically as a stable pivot, with natural feather texture and metallic base that match the original materials?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the quill is positioned vertically in the middle of the open book, acting as a stable pivot. The feather exhibits a natural texture with realistic details, maintaining consistency with the typical texture of feathers. The base is metallic, reflecting the light similarly to how a metallic surface would, matching the materials observed in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
