      "question": "Is the wooden shadow box frame seamlessly integrated around the image with consistent lighting and realistic wood grain texture, without visible seams or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shadow box frame appears well-integrated, with a consistent lighting source that matches the overall image illumination. The wood grain texture is realistic, exhibiting the natural patterns you would expect from real wood. There are no visible seams or floating edges that would disrupt the illusion of a solid, cohesive frame.",

      "question": "Has the background been updated to a soft pastel tone that harmonizes with the hanbokâ€™s colors and maintains even illumination without unnatural color shifts or banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has a soft pastel tone, which complements the gentle hues of the hanbok.

      "question": "Are the newly added embroidered floral details on the hanbok consistent in size, style, and texture with the existing patterns, without appearing overdrawn or artificially layered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral embroidered details on the hanbok in Image B are designed to match the existing patterns. They appear consistent with the overall style, maintaining similar sizing and complexity. The texture does not suggest they are added artificially, blending seamlessly with the garment's fabric.",

      "question": "Is the fan held naturally in the hand with correct finger placement, no extra fingers, and consistent shading and material texture matching the rest of the hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no fan visible in Image B; therefore, it cannot be evaluated based on the description provided. Consequently, there are no issues related to finger placement, shading, or matching textures in this context.",

      "question": "Is the cherry blossom tree positioned behind the figure with appropriate depth, realistic branching, and bloom distribution, without overlapping the body or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom tree is positioned to create a sense of depth, as it appears behind the figure. The branching and bloom distribution are consistent with the natural appearance of such a tree, and there are no overlapping parts on the body, maintaining a clear separation of elements. The shadows cast are coherent with the scene's lighting.",
