      "question": "Are the stitches on the cactus’s body and sombrero clearly visible, evenly spaced, and consistent with the knitting style of the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the cactus's body and sombrero reveals that the stitches are clearly visible and systematically aligned. The texture replicates a hand-knit pattern with uniform spacing, akin to other knitted elements in the set, which suggests consistency in style and technique. Given this observation aligned with common knitted toys, the cactus conforms to the surrounding elements' style.",

      "question": "Do the mane and striped pattern on the donkey display natural yarn-like texture and proper alignment without visible distortions or gaps between stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donkey's mane and striped pattern show a consistent yarn texture typical of crocheted toys. The alignment of the stripes is orderly, and the absence of visible distortions or gaps between stitches suggests a well-crafted design. Such uniformity, considering typical plush craftsmanship, indicates attention to detail in maintaining texture and alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs and body proportions of both the cactus and donkey preserved in a way that reflects typical plush toy design without unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, both the cactus and the donkey exhibit body and limb proportions common to plush toy designs. The cactus maintains a balanced shape within its pot, with limbs extending naturally, and the donkey’s body appears proportionate with its sturdy limbs, typical of a plush toy design. The imagery sustains realistic proportions without signs of distortion typical of well-designed plush toys.",

      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned in a way that suggests it is part of the same scene, with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the plush toys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box is integrated into the scene with lighting that matches the direction and intensity on the plush toys, ensuring cohesiveness. The shadows align with the position of the light source, and the box doesn’t noticeably deviate in shadow or color consistency, making it naturally part of the scene.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, there are no apparent jagged edges, color bleeding, or double outlines at the boundaries of the cactus, pot, donkey, or the background. The elements smoothly transition and maintain clarity, which is essential to maintaining image quality and ensuring a polished finish.",
