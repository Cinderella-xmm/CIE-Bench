    "Question": "Q1: Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
    "explanation": "The frosted crystal frame in Image B retains the intricate carved details, such as the floral crest and side columns, seen in the wooden frame of Image A. The shapes are not warped or flattened but appear clearly and accurately, preserving the original design elements with precision despite the different material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
    "explanation": "The Roman numerals on the crystal face of Image B are similarly positioned and spaced as those in Image A. They are evenly spaced and maintain legibility, aligning with the corresponding hour positions on the original clock face.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal pendulum is symmetrically shaped and hangs naturally, suspended by chains, without any signs of floating or misalignment. The symmetry suggests careful attention to detail, ensuring it matches the wooden pendulum's placement in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
    "explanation": "The white marble wall in Image B appears uniformly textured, resembling the natural veining typically found in real marble. There are no visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and it casts soft, natural shadows beneath the clock, enhancing the authenticity of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
    "explanation": "The crystal components in Image B, including the frame, face, and pendulum, are cohesively integrated. There are no visible gaps or material inconsistencies, and the reflections are consistent with how light would naturally interact with crystal, indicating an integrated design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
