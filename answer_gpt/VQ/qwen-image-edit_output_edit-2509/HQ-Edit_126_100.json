      "question": "Do the transformed columns resemble organic wooden legs with natural joint angles and proportional thickness, without visible distortion or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the columns supporting the house have been transformed to resemble organic, tree-like wooden legs. These columns display characteristics indicative of natural growth such as varying thickness and curvature, akin to legs or roots. The joints appear naturally bent and integrated into the structure, conveying a lifelike appearance. There are no visible distortions or broken geometry in these columns, which indicates a coherent and stable form typical of organic structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the roof area show a gradual transition from straw-like material to leafy branches with realistic leaf shapes, spacing, and lighting interaction, without jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof transitions from a thatched, straw-like appearance to an array of branching leaves. This transition is gradual, blending the straw texture at the bottom smoothly into the leafy canopy above. The leaves are well-detailed with natural shapes and are convincingly placed, showing proper spacing and interaction with the light, which enhances realism. There are no jagged edges or unnatural textures visible that would typically signify poor integration.",

      "question": "Is the satellite dish replaced by a large, detailed eye with a visible iris and pupil, positioned naturally on the side of the structure, without floating elements or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The satellite dish in Image A has been artistically replaced by a large, detailed eye in Image B. The eye is intricately detailed, with a clearly visible iris and pupil, and it is positioned as a natural part of the house structure. There is no indication of floating elements or mismatching in shading, suggesting the eye is intended to be an organic and integral part of the transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wall surfaces covered with detailed bark patterns showing natural cracks, ridges, and color gradients, without repeating textures or uniformity indicating artificial generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The walls of the structure in Image B are converted to resemble tree bark, exhibiting a realistic texture filled with natural cracks and ridges. The color gradients across the wall surfaces enhance this organic appearance, avoiding the uniformity that might indicate artificial generation. The patterns appear varied, contributing to the authenticity and natural look of the structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the orange blossoms emit a faint, diffused glow that blends with ambient lighting, without sharp halos or unnatural brightness that separates them from the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange blossoms are depicted with a soft, diffused glow that gently merges with the ambient light of the scene. This glow is subtle and does not create sharp halos or exhibit unnatural brightness that would set the blossoms apart from their environment. Instead, they are cohesively integrated, maintaining a naturalistic look.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the vines emerge from multiple points on the structure, hang downward with natural curvature and density variation, and interact realistically with light and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Vines in Image B are depicted emerging from multiple points on the structure and hanging downwards. They demonstrate natural curvature and variability in density, both hallmarks of organic plant growth. Additionally, the way these vines interact with the surrounding light and shadow is realistic, enhancing the scene's authenticity and ensuring the vines appear as integral parts of the overall composition.",
