    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet appears well-proportioned and fits naturally on the head. The shape of the helmet is coherent, with smooth edges that match the contours of the head, which suggests it was edited to maintain realism. The placement follows the expected position for wearing a helmet.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each hand has exactly five fingers. The alignment of the fingers and the articulation of the joints appear natural, with no evidence of distortion or stretching. The fingers fit the usual anatomical structure of a human hand.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tones on the snowsuit are vibrant, enhancing visibility. However, the texture remains consistent with that of fabric, not deviating with an overly glossy appearance. The coloration is integrated smoothly into the underlying material, maintaining a realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the snow and tree outlines are sharply defined, reminiscent of paper-cut art. The layers do not exhibit gaps or overlaps and avoid any visual distortion. The composition appears intentional and precise without unnecessary visual noise.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the snowboarder's body posture aligned with the direction of the snowboard, showing balanced weight distribution and no floating limbs or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarderâ€™s posture aligns naturally with the direction of the snowboard. The stance suggests a balanced distribution of weight, crucial for maintaining stability while snowboarding. There are no visible anomalies like floating limbs or limbs positioned at unrealistic angles.",
