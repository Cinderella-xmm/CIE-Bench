      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elderâ€™s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image displays cartoon illustrations of an elder in various outfits, including the hanbok. The facial features are stylized and blurred for anonymization. Cartoons or illustrations typically smooth out textures for artistic representation, which can eliminate realistic skin features such as wrinkles. Thus, the illustration inherently applies smoothing and distortion common to cartoon styles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the floral patterns on the hanbok and foliage are designed in a typical cartoon style. The details are simplified yet consistent across the different cards. Illustration styles often limit detail intentionally for aesthetic or thematic purposes, which explains the simplified yet consistent appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gradient transition across the hanbok's fabric smooth and continuous, with no sharp color breaks or unnatural banding effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a cartoon drawing incorporating gradient transitions in the hanbok fabric. Such illustrations often make use of smooth color transitions to create a pleasant visual flow, and in this image, the transitions appear smooth and continuous across different shades.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes green vine decorations positioned around the floral frame of the cards. The vine elements are well-integrated into the background decoration in a flat cartoon manner, consistent with the overal stylized depiction, and do not appear to float or intersect incorrectly with other elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image featuring an envelope layout alongside cards, the envelope is well-placed with clear, defined edges following a neat design. Jagged edges, clipping, or shadow mismatches are not evident, keeping with the intentional clean and cohesive design of illustrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration employs clean and defined lines typical of cartoon styles, especially for the edges of elements such as hair, fabric folds, and floral accents. There are no indications of jaggedness, pixelation, or ghosting in the edited image, affirming the quality and clarity required for cartoon illustrations.",
