    "Question": "Q1: Does the ship retain its original structural shape and proportion when rendered as part of a spherical globe, without visible warping or stretching of the hull or sails?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ship is placed inside a glass globe and visually appears to retain its original structural shape and proportion. The hull and sails do not show signs of warping or stretching, which could often occur in such renderings if not properly adjusted for perspective within a curved surface. The globe's design does not distort the ship's appearance due to the controlled environment. This consideration ensures the ship's form remains realistic and true to its design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and does the wooden base display natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings without pixelation or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B demonstrates transparency, exhibiting realistic visual effects, such as reflections and refractions of light. The wooden base is depicted with a detailed texture, portraying natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings. There is no evidence of pixelation or repetitive textures, indicating high resolution and attention to detail in the rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the sea creatures clearly visible beneath the ship, properly scaled, and positioned in a manner consistent with underwater motion, without appearing floating unnaturally or distorted?",
    "explanation": "Image B features sea creatures beneath the ship, which are clearly visible and rendered with proper scaling relative to the ship and the globe environment. They are positioned as if swimming below the water's surface, showing natural aquatic placement and movement without signs of distortion or unnatural floating, maintaining consistency with underwater motion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the sails exhibit fine fabric details such as wrinkles and weave patterns that align with the lighting direction and do not show unnatural seams or repeating patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails of the ship are depicted with intricate fabric details, including wrinkles and weave patterns that correspond with the direction of the lighting. This attention to detail ensures that the sails do not exhibit unnatural seams or repeating patterns, contributing to a realistic textile appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the internal clouds smoothly shaped and distributed within the dome without clipping into the ship or glass surface, and do they have soft edges and luminous quality consistent with being lit from above?",
    "explanation": "The clouds within the glass dome in Image B are smoothly shaped and distributed, avoiding any clipping into the ship or glass surface. They possess soft edges and exhibit a luminous quality, consistent with overhead lighting, enhancing the overall atmospheric effect without introducing visual errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
