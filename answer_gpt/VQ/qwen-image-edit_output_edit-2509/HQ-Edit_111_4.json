    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms show smooth, continuous segmentation without abrupt breaks or distorted joints, and do the glowing orbs at their ends appear naturally attached and aligned with the limb direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus arms have been transformed into segmented limbs with glowing orbs at their ends. The segmentation appears smooth and the joints are not visibly distorted. The glowing orbs are aligned with the direction of the limbs, indicating that they appear naturally attached as an extension of the cactus arms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent scales evenly distributed across the cactus surface, following the original rib pattern without visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cactus covered in iridescent scales. These scales are uniformly distributed across the surface and follow the rib pattern of the cactus. The scales do not exhibit any visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts that would indicate an inconsistency or digital error.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the crystal spine rise vertically from the base of the cactus with consistent facets and internal clarity, maintaining alignment with the original trunk and showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal spine in Image B rises vertically from the cactus base with clear and consistent facets. It is well-aligned with the trunk and does not show signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts, maintaining a clean and consistent appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent tendrils positioned along the cactus’s surface in a coherent, organic pattern, with consistent thickness and spacing, and do they cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tendrils are positioned along the cactus surface and form a coherent, organic pattern. They maintain consistent thickness and spacing, and the soft glows from the tendrils match the ambient lighting in the desert environment, giving a natural look.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the transformed cactus fully grounded in the sand, casting a shadow that aligns with the light source and does not show floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the transformed cactus in Image B appears fully grounded in the sand, with a shadow that aligns well with the apparent light source, suggesting it is not floating or disconnected. The shadow’s position relative to the cactus supports this assessment.",
