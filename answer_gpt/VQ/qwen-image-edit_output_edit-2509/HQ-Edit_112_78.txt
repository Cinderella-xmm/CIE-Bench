    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass container display natural transparency with visible embossed patterns that do not appear distorted or unnaturally stretched?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container, which holds the candle, appears to have a pattern embossed on its surface. The patterns are visible and maintain a consistent shape that appears natural given the cylindrical shape of the container. There are no signs of distortion or stretching that one would expect from a flawed image or improper texture application. The transparency of the glass is well-rendered, with the patterns held in proper proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the candle snuffer finial proportionally aligned with the glass container and structurally connected without gaps or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle snuffer finial sits directly on top of the glass container. The proportion of the finial in relation to the container is harmonious, and it appears to be a single unit with the container. There are no visible gaps or signs that the finial is floating separate from the container. As a result, it seems structurally integrated and proportionate.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the marble base show consistent veining and reflective surface without any remnants of lace texture or unnatural seams?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a marble pedestal that supports the glass container. The pedestal has veined patterns typical of marble, consistently applied across its surface. The reflective gloss on the pedestal's top adds realism. There are no remnants of lace texture or unexplained seams, which suggests this is a polished, single piece of marble rendered without errors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the nameplate attached to the side of the container at a natural height and angle, with no floating or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The nameplate on the glass container in Image B is at a conventional height that matches where a nameplate would be placed. It does not show any signs of floating separately or clipping into the glass, maintaining a realistic attachment. This indicates careful attention to detail and positioning in its alignment on the container.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections and shadows on the glass container, marble base, and finial align with the direction of the light source and exhibit consistent material behavior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the direction of the light source can be inferred from the shadows cast and the reflections present on the glass, marble base, and finial. All these elements display reflections and shadows consistent with a single directional light source coming from the left. The materials behave as expected: glass shows transparency with reflections, marble reflects light while showing veined detail, and the metallic finial also reflects appropriately. This consistency suggests accurate rendering of light across varied materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
