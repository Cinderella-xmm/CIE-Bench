      "question": "Does the cat maintain its structural coherence and natural texture, without showing any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object of focus is not a cat but a human riding a horse within a cinematic backdrop. Since the question asks about the cat's structural coherence, and Image B does not feature a cat, we must recognize that the question is inapplicable here. Therefore, the assessment of structural coherence and natural texture for a cat cannot be made in this context.",

      "question": "Is the new background of a ruined city seamlessly integrated, avoiding any visible breaks or inconsistencies that betray the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop is a post-apocalyptic cityscape featuring damaged buildings and debris. Visually, the integration appears seamless as there are no evident mismatches or breaks between the horse, rider, and background. The lighting, shadows, and atmospheric perspective suggest a cohesive scene typical of cinematic settings. This implies that the background has been effectively integrated.",

      "question": "Does the text “LAST RIDE” appear natural and appropriately styled, without introducing any distracting elements that could detract from the image's overall harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'LAST RIDE' is prominently featured at the top of Image B, styled in a bold, block font with a color tone that contrasts with the background yet complements the muted, cool tones of the scene. It does not introduce any distracting elements, as it fits the cinematic theme by resembling a movie poster title, harmoniously integrating with the overall composition.",

      "question": "Has the cool-tone filter been applied evenly across the image, preserving the clarity and fine details of both the cat and the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no cat present; instead, it is characterized by a cool-tone color palette. The filter is uniformly applied, enhancing the overall ambiance while maintaining the clarity and detail of both the horse and the cityscape. This consistency suggests the cool-tone filter application is even throughout the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the film rating label fit naturally within the composition of the image, complementing rather than disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, at the lower left corner, there is a film rating label resembling the style typically present on movie posters. It is subtly incorporated, ensuring that the attention remains on the primary subjects of the image (the horse and rider) without being disruptive. The label complements the overall cinematic theme and layout without being obtrusive, indicating a natural fit within the composition.",
