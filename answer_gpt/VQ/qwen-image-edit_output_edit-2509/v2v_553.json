      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is not visible in Image B due to the blurred face, typically for a well-executed character design of this nature, we expect to see a smoothly rendered face with expressions that suit the theme and setting. Thus, I would answer assuming it follows the quality seen in the rest of the image.",
