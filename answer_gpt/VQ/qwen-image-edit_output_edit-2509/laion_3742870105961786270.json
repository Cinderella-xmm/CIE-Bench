    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the converted jug appear as a translucent glass stopper with visible reflections and refractions, and is it properly aligned with the bottle’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jug held by the figure has been transformed into a translucent glass stopper, which shows visual effects typical of glass, such as reflections and refractions. The alignment with the figure's hand and arm that supports the jug appears natural and consistent with the position of the bottle’s neck, suggesting a seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robe seamlessly transformed into a bottle shape with smooth contours, natural lighting gradients, and no visible tears or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe retains its flowing appearance and blends into the shape of a bottle. The transformation shows smooth contours and lighting gradients that match the folds and natural drape of a cloak, with no noticeable tears, rips, or geometric distortions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the goose-shaped charm integrated into the base of the bottle with a visible connection point, and does it maintain proportional size and stylized but recognizable features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goose in Image B has been decorated with stylized designs, perhaps giving it the appearance of a charm. It is integrated into the composition, maintaining a consistent size proportional to the surrounding features, and while stylized, it remains recognizable as a goose with its shape and features clearly delineated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grapevine engravings clearly defined, following the bottle’s contour, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent line thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Taking a closer look at Image B, the grapevine engravings on the surrounding elements of the bottle appear to be consistently placed. The lines are clear, the detailing is precise, and they follow the contours smoothly without unexpected breaks or thickness changes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cardboard packaging fully enclosed around the bottle with clean edges, subtle shadows, and clear classical motifs without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the cardboard packaging appears next to the figure rather than encapsulating the bottle itself. It features clean, precise edges and contains classical motifs, clearly printed without visible blurring or misalignment. This integration hints at the concept of packaging rather than physical enclosure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the earthy tones and gold accents uniformly applied across all surfaces, with appropriate material-specific highlights and no abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall color scheme with earthy tones and gold accents is consistently applied across the surfaces of the figure. The highlights and shadows follow natural contours and texture perceptions, with no sudden or unexpected changes in color, indicating a uniform treatment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
