    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a horse figure covered in elaborate floral patterns all over its body. These patterns are painted rather than assembled as puzzle sections, which implies there are no actual puzzle sections with defined edges on the horse's body. The floral design seamlessly integrates across the body and does not display characteristics typical of interlocking puzzle sections.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the surface of the horse is covered with floral patterns that appear continuous and uninterrupted, suggesting a painted surface with coherent design rather than a jigsaw puzzle construction. As there are no puzzle sections present, the concept of aligning patterns across puzzle pieces does not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears exceptionally clear, with faithful properties of transparency and an absence of distortions. It accurately replicates realistic glass characteristics without smudges or unnatural reflections, indicating a high-quality material simulation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden base that features a highly detailed and realistic wood grain, suggesting quality in textural rendering. The compass is positioned on top of the base and fits well in terms of scale and alignment with the surface plane, enhancing the visual credibility of both elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antique-brass accents in Image B, observed on the top of the dome and the base's detailing, have a finish that convincingly resembles aged metal, transitioning from matte to slight reflectiveness. Their placement on the top finial and the base is logical and enhances the overall aesthetic coherence, demonstrating careful attention to realistic design.",
