      "question": "Does the transition from a rainy street to a sunny park appear seamless without any unnatural textures or lighting inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the environment has been transformed from a rainy street to a sunny park setting. The overall lighting is consistent with bright and sunny weather, and there are no evident mismatches or abrupt changes in textures that would suggest an unnatural appearance. The scene integrates elements such as sunlight and shadows which align naturally with the park setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the new clothing items on the characters appropriate for sunny weather and do they look natural without any visible distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B continue to wear the same clothing as they did in Image A. However, these items do not appear distorted or out of place even though they may not be typical for sunny weather, which suggests an intentional stylistic choice rather than an editing inconsistency. The attire maintains a realistic fabric texture and fits naturally on the characters.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials of the new clothing items and the environment in the sunny park setting appear realistic and consistent with what would be expected in such a scenario?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the characters have not changed clothing, the materials retain their realistic textures, which harmonize well with the sunnier setting due to the consistent lighting and context. The park environment itself—grass, flowers, and trees—is rendered with realism consistent with outdoor settings.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The details of the clothing and surroundings are maintained in Image B. The texture of the fabrics, the depiction of the foliage, and the shadowing are all consistent without signs of artificial alterations or degradation of detail.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the characters and objects in Image B appear consistent with a realistic depiction. The sizes relative to each other and the environment match logical human scaling and spatial orientation typical in park settings.",
