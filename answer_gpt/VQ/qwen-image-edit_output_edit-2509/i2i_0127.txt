    "Question": "Q1: Does the addition of the 'Clean First' slogan in the top left corner maintain the natural appearance and does not introduce any obvious artifacts like blurry edges or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Clean First' slogan appears in the top left corner with a blue background that curves smoothly into the tiled area of the wall. The edges of the design are sharp and do not display any noticeable blur.

    "explanation": "In Image B, the sizes of the slogans are moderate and do not overshadow the main subject of the image, which is the toilet.

    "Question": "Q5: Are the slogans aligned in a way that respects the geometric shapes of the tiled walls and floor, ensuring the structural and visual coherence of the entire image?",
    "explanation": "Both slogans in Image B are positioned in such a way that they do not overlap with any individual tile, maintaining the visual grid formed by the tiles. The curved edges of the blue backgrounds are designed not to clash with the straight, geometric lines of the tiles, thereby respecting the existing grid structure. This alignment supports both the structural and visual coherence of the image.",
