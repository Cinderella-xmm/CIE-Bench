      "question": "Does the lime wedge retain its natural green hue and textured rind, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even after being shaped into a smiling cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lime wedge in the edited image is depicted as a cap on the glass. Its natural green hue and textured rind remain clear, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even when positioned unusually. The lime shows its realistic features such as color and texture, typical of a lime peel, which suggests it was skillfully shaped to fit the cap design without compromising its visual integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ice cubes are shaped as eyes in the edited image. They appear solid and translucent with sharp edges, maintaining a realistic cube appearance. They are positioned naturally within the liquid, without any unnatural floating, which suggests a realistic portrayal consistent with real ice cubes in a drink.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sugar rim along the glass edge uniformly granular and continuous, with no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring that disrupts the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sugar rim shown in the edited image is continuous and uniformly granular, maintaining the typical appearance of a salt/sugar rim on a glass. There are no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring observed, which supports the consistency and natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sombrero and maracas have consistent material textures (e.g., woven straw, wood grain, reflective beads), correct scale relative to the glass, and proper shadows that match the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sombrero and maracas are depicted with consistent textures, simulating materials like straw and wood/beads effectively. They appear in the correct scale relative to the glass, suggesting familiarity with real scaled proportions. The shadows cast by these objects match the overall lighting of the image, ensuring a convincing and appropriate visual setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the confetti pieces varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows, and do they appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The confetti pieces present diverse colors and shapes and are rendered with soft edges, showing an understanding of real confetti appearance. They achieve a realistic look by having subtle shadows and appear to lie naturally on the surface without creating an illusion of floating or unrealistic overlapping.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text “Fiesta Time!” clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements, and does it have consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Fiesta Time!' is placed prominently at the top of the edited image. It is clearly visible, evenly spaced, and does not overlap any other visual components, which makes it stand out appropriately for the design. The text also displays consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing, contributing to its readability and fitting placement.",
