      "question": "Does the gilded brocade texture on the kneeling figure's robe show consistent metallic sheen and intricate pattern details without unnatural highlights or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kneeling figure's robe in Image B features a gilded brocade texture that consists of complex, detailed patterns that resemble authentic brocade fabrics. Utilizing world knowledge about textiles, especially brocade, which typically has intricate design work with metallic threading producing a consistent sheen, allows us to judge the appearance in this image. Given the information, Image B does not show unnatural highlights or repetitive patterns, maintaining a consistent metallic sheen, thus satisfying the conditions described.",

      "question": "Is the velvet texture on the standing figure's cloak rendered with natural depth, soft shading, and smooth transitions between folds without abrupt edges or unnatural compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Velvet is a fabric known for its soft, thick pile and rich texture. Based on the Image B observation, the standing figure's cloak exhibits characteristics of rich velvet with smooth transitions between folds and depth that aligns with the softness typical of velvet. There are no abrupt edges or signs of compression that would be inconsistent with the portrayal of velvet. This observation leads to a conclusion of rendered natural depth and shading in the cloak.",

      "question": "Are the silver swaddling bands wrapped around the infant’s body correctly aligned with anatomical contours and free from gaps, overlaps, or misplaced reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver bands around the infant show correct placement along the anatomical lines, covering the body without irregular gaps or overlaps. Proper alignment would see the bands following the natural curves of the infant’s body with reflections placed correctly according to curves and texture. As observed, the bands follow these principles, leading to a well-rendered depiction without flaws.",

      "question": "Do the classical columns and divine motifs in the background align with the figures' scale and perspective, showing correct foreshortening and shadow direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays classical columns and divine motifs that suggest depth and grand architecture. The scale proportion between these elements and the figures conforms to reasonable perspective rules, with the columns and motifs projecting depth and aligning correctly with the scene's perspective. Shadows are directed consistently across both the figures and background, adhering to proper foreshortening guidelines known in classical artwork.",

      "question": "Do the hands of the kneeling and standing figures display five fingers each with natural curvature, unbroken lines, and no extra digits or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the hands of both figures appear anatomically sound with natural curvature, each displaying five fingers without distortion or extra digits. This observation is validated by the depiction of hands showing typical human anatomy consistent with artistic representations, leading to confirmation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the golden halos above both figures complete circles, evenly spaced from the head, and free from deformation or clipping into hair or garments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden halos in Image B are depicted as full circles that are consistently spaced around the figures’ heads. World knowledge about halos in religious art affirms that halos are often represented as complete circles to symbolize divinity and should float above the figures without interfering with physical elements like hair or clothing. Observations show no deformation or clipping into external elements.",

      "question": "Does the entire scene exhibit a uniform fresco-like texture with subtle brushstroke patterns and muted tones, without visible digital seams or overly sharp contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B mirrors fresco artwork, typically characterized by texture showcasing brushstrokes that merge in subtle ways, and tones that are muted compared to digital artistry, which can often have visible seams and sharp contrasts. The uniform fresco-like appearance without digital artifacts or abrupt contrast fits the characteristics observed in classical fresco environments.",
