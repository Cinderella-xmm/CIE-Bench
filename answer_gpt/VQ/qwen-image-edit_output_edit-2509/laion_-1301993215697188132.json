    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the owl's head retain proper geometric proportions with a beak that aligns with the jawline and eyes that are symmetrically placed and shaped like those of a real owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl's face shows symmetrical placement where its eyes are positioned evenly on both sides. This is consistent with typical owl anatomy where eyes are symmetrically placed. The beak aligns well with the jawline, providing a natural appearance similar to real owls. These design choices indicate proper geometric proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the cloak consistent in direction, shading, and density, and do they blend naturally with the original blue color without visible seams or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloak in Image B features feathers that have a consistent direction horizontally across the owl's body. Shading and density are uniform, achieving a smooth gradient with the blue color scheme, showing no visible seams or pixelation. This uniformity and natural blend suggest careful editing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses resting securely on the beak with correct reflection and shadow placement, and do they match the size and style of typical reading glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glasses are correctly positioned to rest on the owl's beak, with the lenses showing correct proportions for reading glasses. The reflection and shadow placement follow a logical placement pattern, indicating a realistic alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand replaced with a wing-like structure that has logical joint placement and feather coverage, and does it lack extra fingers or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wing-like structures in Image B are depicted logically with the feathers covering the joint areas. They follow a smooth curve without exhibiting extra fingers or unnatural bends, presenting a realistic and natural extension of the owl's anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed adjacent to the beak, contain legible text with contrasting colors, and do not overlap with other elements like the microphone or feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are placed near the owl's beak, ensuring the text is legible with contrasting colors that make them stand out. The placement avoids overlap with other elements, such as microphone or feathers, ensuring clarity and proper placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branches extend from the background with natural tapering and bark texture, and are they positioned behind the subject without casting incorrect shadows or appearing flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches taper naturally and show appropriate bark texture, extending from the background. They are correctly positioned behind the owl, showing no incorrect shadows or flatness, maintaining a three-dimensional appearance consistent with the context of the image.",
