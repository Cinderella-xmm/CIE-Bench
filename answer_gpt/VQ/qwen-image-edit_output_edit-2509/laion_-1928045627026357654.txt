    "Question": "Q1: Does the male's shirt display a consistent 3D plush texture with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural shading that breaks the illusion of depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the male's shirt features a vibrant and geometric pattern that resembles a cartoonish or digital texture rather than a realistic 3D plush texture. The color transitions and lines are very sharp and lack the natural depth seen in fabric. Common knowledge about digital imaging suggests that a more realistic 3D effect would show gradual shading and shadows. Therefore, there are elements that break the illusion of depth, indicating some inconsistency.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the collar of the male's shirt proportionally enlarged without distorting the neck or shoulder line, and does it maintain smooth contours without sharp or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "The collar of the shirt in Image B is notably wide and extends outward more than usual. It does not show distortion around the neck or shoulder lines, suggesting a secure fit, and the geometric pattern smoothly transitions without visible jagged or broken edges. This gives the shirt a consistent and proportional appearance around the collar area.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the pleats on the female's pants symmetrically arranged and physically plausible, without floating or overlapping layers that defy gravity or fabric tension?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the female's pants display a highly stylized pleat design that appears exaggerated compared to realistic clothing. They have overlapping layers that seem to defy gravity, as traditional pleats would fall in a more natural alignment due to fabric tension and gravity. This suggests the design veers away from realism, leading to floating layers.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the enlarged sleeve on the female’s top extend naturally from the shoulder without distorting her arm or causing unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand?",
    "explanation": "The female’s top in Image B includes dramatically enlarged sleeves that extend seamlessly from the shoulder. The fabric appears to be puffed and rounded, and there are no visible distortions or awkward overlaps around the elbow and hand area, maintaining a smooth and continuous contour. This gives a sense of intentional and stylized fashion design rather than a production flaw.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters evenly lit and proportionally scaled, with no abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that suggest poor integration?",
    "explanation": "The stage in Image B is evenly lit with harmonious pastel colors. The transitions between different colors on the stage are smooth, and there are no unexpected shadow areas or abrupt color shifts that would suggest issues with integration or scaling. The even quality of lighting and color distribution enhances the aesthetic balance of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
