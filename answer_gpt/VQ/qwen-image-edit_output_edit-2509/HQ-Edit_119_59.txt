    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are exaggerated in size, characteristic of a cartoon or stylized representation. The muscles are overly large compared to a natural human physique, which is a common feature in caricature or comic art styles. Given that it's a stylization, the anatomical accuracy is less of a focus. The contours and muscle groups are drawn for effect more than realistic anatomical depiction, leading to the conclusion that they do not maintain anatomical plausibility.",
    "answer": "No"
