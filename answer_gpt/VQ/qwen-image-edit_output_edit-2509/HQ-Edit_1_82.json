      "question": "Do the gymnast’s limbs maintain natural joint angles and proportional lengths without exaggerated bends or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's limbs appear to be proportionate and maintain natural joint angles. There are no exaggerated bends or missing segments in the depiction of their limbs. This conclusion is drawn from the visual representation of the limbs which align with typical human anatomy and joint positioning, suggesting that the editing maintains realistic limb structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the seams and fabric folds on the leotard clearly defined and flowing naturally, without jagged edges or unnatural creasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows leotards with seams and fabric folds that appear neatly defined and flowing naturally without visible jagged edges or creasing that would seem unnatural. This is determined by visually assessing the smoothness and continuity of these folds and seams, typical in a high-quality fabric representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors used in the gymnast’s outfit and background consistently within the earthy tone range without sudden shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gymnast’s outfits in Image B utilize earthy tones with golds and browns, which are harmonious and consistent across all panels. This consistency is noted through visual observation of the image, where the choice of colors creates a cohesive look without sudden color shifts or clashing hues with the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sequin patterns aligned with the existing design on the leotard and uniformly distributed without clustering or overlapping in unnatural ways?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sequin patterns on the leotards in Image B are aligned with the designs and appear uniformly distributed. There is no observable clustering or overlapping that appears haphazard. This conclusion is based on visual inspection of the sequence arrangement in accordance with typical leotard embellishment patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the panel boundaries positioned so that key figures and objects (e.g., gymnast’s head, balance beam) are fully contained within one panel without being split or truncated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the panel boundaries are positioned strategically to ensure that key figures and objects, such as the gymnasts’ bodies and the balance beam, are fully contained within each panel. There is no visible truncation or division of essential parts of the figures, which would detract from visual continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the dark walnut frame have a uniform texture and depth, and does it sit flush around the artwork without casting unnatural shadows or appearing translucent?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dark walnut frame in Image B appears to have a uniform texture and depth. It sits flush around the artwork and does not cast unnatural shadows or appear translucent. This assessment is based on a visual inspection, determining that the frame maintains the characteristics of solid wood framing.",
