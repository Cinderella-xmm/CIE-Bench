    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs of the figure have clearly defined joints and correct proportions, with no missing or extra limbs, and do the hands each have exactly five fingers arranged naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the arms and legs of the figure appear to be those of a doll. Dolls often have articulated joints to simulate movement, but these joints are not always visible or defined in detail. The hands on this figure do not accurately portray five distinct fingers. Instead, the image shows typical doll characteristics where hand details may be underrepresented. Based on common doll design, fingers are often molded together, indicating an inaccurate representation of natural anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the jacket and the stitching on the skirt preserved and aligned correctly, with no distorted or repeated textures, and does the fabric drape naturally over the doll's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket and skirt appear to have a well-preserved pattern with no visible distortion or repetition of textures. The fabric seems to drape naturally over the doll's form, suggesting a realistic rendering of the materials. The visual details such as patterns and stitches align well with expectations for high-quality doll garments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lace trim around the collar thin and evenly applied, with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural shadows indicating poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the lace trim around the collar as thin and professionally applied. It shows no visible gaps, aligns well with the form, and exhibits no unnatural shadows. This suggests high attention to detail commonly seen in designer dolls or figures with intricate costuming.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the velvet hat properly sized relative to the head, with visible fabric texture and soft shadows that suggest it is resting on the head rather than floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet hat is proportional to the head, showcasing a realistic size that fits well. The fabric texture of the hat is visible, and the shadows underneath are soft, suggesting that the hat is indeed resting naturally on the head and not floating above it.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages in the background proportionally smaller than the doll and rendered with consistent textures and lighting that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B places the doll in an environment where the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages appear proportionally smaller than the doll, creating a sense of perspective. The textures are consistent, and the lighting complements the overall scene, enhancing the realism typical of a well-crafted miniature or set.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the face have simplified features typical of a doll (such as painted eyes and smooth skin), and do the limbs show clear joint lines or hinges without unnatural bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face is characteristic of a doll, with simplified features such as smooth skin and likely painted details. The limbs are consistent with common doll design, showing joint lines without unnatural bending or stretching. These elements support the notion that the figure is indeed a doll with accurately rendered features.",
