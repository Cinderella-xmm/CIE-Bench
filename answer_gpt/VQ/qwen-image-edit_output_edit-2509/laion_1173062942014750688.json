    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a sculpture of a serpent made out of bead segments. The arrangement of these segments in Image B shows that the beads are organized cohesively, forming smooth curves that typically represent the body of a serpent. Natural serpents have bodies that smoothly taper and curve without angular disruptions. The beads are organized to resemble this structure, showing a fluid continuity without abrupt angles or misalignments, which imitates a realistic serpent shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's head has prominent blue circular elements located where eyes are usually positioned on a serpent or snake, suggesting intentional design as eyes. These markings appear smoothly integrated into the head's surface, giving the impression of a seamless part of the sculpture. Such integration and positioning are typical for eyes, providing a symmetrical, realistic animal-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates black tribal-like markings over the serpent's body. These markings follow the contours of the serpent's shape, enhancing the visual flow and continuity characteristic of a snake's natural body. The markings do not display sharp or unnaturally harsh edges that could indicate digital artifacting. Instead, they have a diversity in design that avoids monotonous uniform repetition, aligning with an organic patterning style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B has a tail that extends from the body and tapers down naturally, which is typical for serpentine and snake-like designs. At the end of this tail, small bead-like segments appear to dangle and are loosely connected, imitating the natural hanging or swaying motion seen in animal tails. This continuation ensures the structure remains coherent without interruptions or disjointed appearances.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture appears consistent with either a matte or slightly glossy finish similar to ceramic or polished materials commonly associated with bead designs. Unlike Image A, where the beads have a certain shine due to light reflection, Image B reflects a similar uniformity without unexpected shine or roughness variations. This consistent material impression avoids inconsistencies that would detract from the realistic appearance.",
