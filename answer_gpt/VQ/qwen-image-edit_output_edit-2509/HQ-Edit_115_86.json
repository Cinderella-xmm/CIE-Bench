      "question": "Does the tutu maintain a balanced, layered structure with no visible warping or collapsed sections that suggest digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tutu in the edited image shows a well-layered and balanced structure with a consistent circular shape that complements the ballerina's pose. The layering looks natural without any signs of digital distortion such as warping or collapsing sections. The skirt flares out uniformly, supporting the traditional silhouette of a tutu. Based on visual inspection, it suggests a high-quality illustration without digital editing flaws.",

      "question": "Are the glitter elements seamlessly blended into the tutu and bodice, showing natural variation in size and brightness without pixelation or unnatural clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glitter on the tutu and bodice is depicted as smooth and naturally integrated within the overall design of the ballet costume. They vary in size and brightness, enhancing the visual appeal without displaying pixelation or clumping. This suggests that the glitter elements are well rendered and artistically blended without any visible digital artifacts.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background gradient in the edited image shows a smooth transition of colors, transitioning gently in a way that complements the silhouette of the ballerina without exhibiting any visible banding or abrupt shifts. It is continuous and well-complemented visually with the image's overall aesthetic. Such smoothness implies high-quality digital design techniques.",
