      "question": "Does the mechanical eye seamlessly integrate with the camera's original form without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B's visual cues, the mechanical eye is designed with precise detailing and complementary coloring. The eye blends smoothly with the camera's original contours without disrupting its surface texture or obscuring fine details. The integration is enhanced by the harmonious color palette and texture matching, maintaining a realistic appearance. The eye's distinct form doesn't clash with the camera's structural coherence.",

      "question": "Do the copper feathers appear naturally integrated with the camera's casing, maintaining the overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the copper feathers exhibit skillful integration with the camera's casing. They appear to grow organically from the camera form, respecting its contours and surface textures. The feathers' realistic shading and body language complement the camera's three-dimensional shape, avoiding sharp distinctions that could detract from the natural appearance. Their placement and texture are compatible with the camera's design, reinforcing the authenticity.",

      "question": "Are the gears and springs within the battery compartment depicted in a way that preserves the structural consistency and visual credibility of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the depiction of the gears and springs is detailed and consistent. The gears maintain proportionality and alignment within the compartment, respecting the camera's structural design. The mechanical elements appear to belong logically within the designated space, showing no intrusion or unnatural alignment. Their sizing, placement, and design preserve the camera's visual credibility by appearing functional and integral.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the camera and the clockwork owl elements create a visually credible and coherent scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the scene in Image B, the combination of the camera and clockwork owl elements achieves visual credibility through meticulous design integration. The mechanical eye, copper feathers, and gears form a coherent ensemble by aligning with the camera's structural character. Each additional element complements the camera's original form, maintaining symmetry and cohesiveness. The choice of materials, colors, and textures facilitates a seamless visual transition between the components, reinforcing scene coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the added elements, such as the mechanical eye and copper feathers, avoid distortion and maintain a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and positioning of the mechanical eye and copper feathers have been carefully considered. They integrate with the camera without causing distortion or disrupting the original design. The elements are scaled appropriately to fit within the camera form, maintaining symmetry and avoiding exaggeration that could lead to unnatural appearances. The placement aligns with structural sense, contributing to natural physical rationality.",
