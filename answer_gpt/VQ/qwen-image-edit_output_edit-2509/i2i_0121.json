      "question": "Does the character maintain its structural consistency as a chibi version, with no disproportionate or overly exaggerated body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is presented in a chibi style, which typically features a larger head compared to the body, smaller limbs, and simplified facial features. The character in this image adheres to the expected proportions of a chibi character without any parts appearing overly disproportionate or exaggerated beyond the typical chibi style. Thus, the structural consistency is maintained according to the chibi art style norms.",

      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base seamlessly integrated with the keychain, avoiding any evident artifacts or unnatural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell-shaped base is integrated with the keychain design. The boundaries between the character, shell, and keychain appear smooth, with no visible artifacts or seams that disrupt the flow or natural look of the combined elements. The integration seems intentional and fitting for the design of a keychain accessory.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the character's facial features retained their distinctiveness in chibi form, without losing important details such as eye shape and mouth expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's facial features are simplified but still distinctive, preserving key elements such as the eye shape, mouth expression, and signature scar under the left eye. These elements remain identifiable and true to the character's imagery while adhering to the chibi style. Thus, the facial features have been retained effectively in chibi form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character appear naturally positioned on the shell-shaped base, with a logical and stable stance, avoiding any awkward angles or impossible positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted standing on the shell-shaped base with a stable stance. The feet are evenly placed, and the overall positioning suggests a natural and balanced stance without any awkward angles or tilts. This positioning is practical for a chibi keychain design where stability is visualized naturally.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the character, including clothing and skin, as well as the shell-shaped base, look natural and cohesive, avoiding any incongruent or artificial surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's clothing and skin textures are stylized in line with chibi art norms. The shell-shaped base and the character's textures show a consistent use of color and shading typical for illustrated keychain designs. No incongruent or overly artificial surfaces are visible, suggesting a cohesive and intentional artistic approach.",
