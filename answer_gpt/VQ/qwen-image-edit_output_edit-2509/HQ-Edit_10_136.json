      "question": "Is the writing box proportionally sized relative to the stool, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the room's lighting direction without appearing floating or detached?",
      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a writing box positioned on a stool. The box is proportionally smaller relative to the stool, which appears logical and consistent with expected box-to-stool size ratios in reality. Additionally, a subtle shadow is cast, aligning with the apparent lighting direction of the room, suggesting the box is firmly placed and not floating.",
