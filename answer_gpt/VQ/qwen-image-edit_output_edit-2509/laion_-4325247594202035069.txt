    "Question": "Q1: Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows four figures with vibrant coloring and soft textures, typical of fabric toys, reflecting bold stripes in blue, green, red, and yellow. The surface appears seamless and lacks pixelation or artificial textures. This aligns with a soft fabric toy design rather than its original hard sculpted look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are clearly fish-like with fins and tails, maintaining a dynamic pose but adding elements suitable for the aquatic theme, like fins. They retain coherent structure and smooth transitions from previous limbs without unnatural bends, displaying a cohesive transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
    "explanation": "There are no longer visible weapons; instead, the fish figures in Image B show anatomically coherent fish-like features (fins and tails). These elements are integrated with the body, displaying logical placement unlike floating or misaligned components.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B resembles a sandy, underwater environment and is suitable for the fish-like theme. The figures appear naturally positioned on this surface without clipping or floating, demonstrating a realistic depiction consistent with this setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "Image B replaces the humanoid figures with fish-like entities that do not have hands or fingers, so the original count and position considerations do not apply here. Thus, it does not reflect hand features and alters the original form.",
    "answer": "No"
