    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the right-side skier maintain a natural texture and appearance without visible artifacts where he appears to slide out of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examine the area around the skier, looking for artifacts or disruptions in the texture of his clothing or environment. The texture should appear consistent, natural, and integrated with the surroundings without obvious signs of image editing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural bending in the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the skier's posture and the equipment should show smooth and natural curves without awkward bending or disproportionate angles, which would indicate distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shadow cast by the right-side skier remain consistent with the light source and appear naturally elongated or altered appropriately due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluate the direction and length of the shadow, ensuring it aligns with the light source in the image. It should interact appropriately with the snow as expected from natural lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow texture around the right-side skier smooth and uninterrupted, without showing signs of unnatural blending or disruption from the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Check the area around the skier for consistency in snow texture. The snow should seamlessly blend with the skier's motion without jagged lines or blending artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details on the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis remain sharp and clear, without any blurring or loss of detail due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Focus on the equipment and clothing of the skier, assessing the clarity and sharpness of details. The elements should have well-defined edges and maintain detail integrity despite motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
