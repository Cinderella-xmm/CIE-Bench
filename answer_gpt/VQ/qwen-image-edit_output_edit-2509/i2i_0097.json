    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the addition of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” appear naturally integrated without disrupting the overall visual balance of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' is positioned above and below a central element—a spoon in a bowl graphic—maintaining symmetry and balance. While Image A displays a spoon on a plate centrally, in Image B, although the presentation is different, the positioning ensures a visually balanced design, accommodating the textual additions seamlessly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural textures introduced in the image due to the text overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' as well as other elements appear clear and well-rendered without visible artifacts or hiccups in texture. The graphics and text blend smoothly without apparent disruptions, suggesting careful integration and design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the text sizes for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” seem proportional and appropriate compared to the scale of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Master Chef' text is large and occupies the top segment prominently, while 'Final Round' is smaller, placed at the bottom, reflecting typical design hierarchy. The sizes are proportionate to the graphic elements—a spoon in a pot—emphasizing 'Master Chef' as the main focus while 'Final Round' acts as a subtitle, similar to how one would expect in related media or promotional content.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the font style chosen for “Master Chef” and “Final Round” complement the simplicity of the white plate and silver spoon, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font style in Image B is bold and sans-serif, which provides modernity and clarity, suited for a culinary-themed graphic and an event-like 'Final Round'. While Image A features no text, the chosen fonts in Image B do not detract from the focal elements (spoon and pot) and uphold a credible visual harmony.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the circular shape of the plate remained intact and undistorted despite the addition of the text elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no direct representation of a plate similar to Image A. Instead, a central spoon and pot are used, and as such, the circular representation from Image A isn't directly translatable here. As there’s no plate in Image B to be distorted, the comparison isn't entirely applicable.",
