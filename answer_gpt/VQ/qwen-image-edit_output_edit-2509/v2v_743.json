      "question": "Does the chibi figurine emerge from the Polaroid frame without any visible breaks or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figurine appears to be contained within the Polaroid frame. The edges of the frame show no signs of the figurine emerging or overlapping in any unnatural way. The positioning and visual layout suggest the figurine is meant to be inside the photograph, with the frame providing a clear boundary. Therefore, the frame and figurine interaction appears natural, with no visible breaks or unnatural edges.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi figurine consistent with its interaction with the Polaroid frame and the human hand, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figurine in Image B is proportioned to fit within the Polaroid frame, which is held by a human hand. The size of the figurine in relation to the hand and frame is consistent and realistic, as commonly seen in such photographs, where the subject is scaled appropriately to fit within a small frame without distortion. This indicates that the proportions are maintained accurately without any scaling issues.",

      "question": "Does the chibi figurine retain clear and natural textures, especially in areas like clothing and hair, without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figurine exhibits distinct textures in its hair and clothing. The yellow attire shows a smooth texture typical of fabric, and the hair retains a visually detailed appearance with individual strands visible, contributing to a natural look. Both elements mimic those expected in well-designed models, indicating that there is no significant loss of detail.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the yellow attire of the chibi figurine consistent in color and material with the original image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, the chibi figurine's attire in both images showcases a consistent color and material appearance. The yellow shirt and headband maintain the same color tone and are rendered in a similar material texture that mimics the real fabric visually depicted in Image A. This consistency aids in achieving a natural look in the edited image.",

      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph and the human hand holding it appear natural and structurally consistent, with no unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Polaroid photograph in Image B is held by a human hand, which appears proportionate and naturally positioned. The photograph's edges, design, and the way it is held show no signs of distortion or unnatural artifacts. The interaction between the photograph and the hand, such as the angle and grip, reflects a natural and realistic presentation, common in actual photographs of this nature.",
