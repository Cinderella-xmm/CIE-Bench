      "question": "Does the mirror-like surface in the foreground reflect the sky, trees, and Eiffel Tower with clear, undistorted imagery and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground includes a mirror-like surface. This surface reflects its surroundings clearly and smoothly, which includes elements like the sky, trees, and Eiffel Tower. World knowledge suggests that a mirror-like surface should ideally provide a clear reflection if its texture is flawless and undistorted. Observing Image B, the reflections appear coherent and understandable, maintaining a high degree of clarity and consistent visibility of reflected elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant buildings and tree clusters positioned at distinct depth layers without overlapping or misaligned edges that suggest incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the distant structures such as buildings and tree clusters seem to be positioned in a manner that reflects distinct depth layers. Common visual cues for assessing depth layering include how objects overlap or align, and assessing if objects appear convincingly where they should be in relation to each other. In Image B, the positioning is consistent and provides a clear visual distinction between objects without evident overlaps or misalignments that would suggest errors in depth perception.",

      "question": "Do the small pedestrian figures on the pathways have consistent proportions, recognizable body parts, and smooth textures without visible deformities or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the pedestrian figures on the pathways are depicted. Recognizing consistent proportions and body parts relies on ensuring that individual figures look natural and human-like. Observing Image B indicates that the pedestrians maintain recognizable proportions without signs of distortion. Their textures appear smooth, supporting a logical interpretation of these figures as normal, non-deformed entities. This assessment is supported by visual knowledge about human figures.",

      "question": "Is the dark frame with metallic edges present around the entire perimeter of the image, appearing solid and uniformly integrated without breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates a dark frame with metallic edges surrounding its perimeter. To determine uniform integration, it's important to assess the frame's continuity and cohesion, ensuring no breaks or misalignments are visible. The frame in Image B appears solid and consistently integrated, maintaining smooth metallic edges throughout its boundary without signs of interruption or displacementâ€”signifying a cohesive design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the engraved city names and coordinates along the frame legible, precisely aligned, and free from pixelation or uneven spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals engraved details on the frame which include city names and coordinates. Legibility relies on clarity and the ability to read characters distinctly, whereas alignment and spacing evaluate the precision and aesthetic consistency. The engravings in Image B appear clear, precisely aligned, and evenly spaced, facilitating easy reading without evidence of pixelation or spacing errors. This judgment is derived from visual analysis and common standards for textual engravings.",
