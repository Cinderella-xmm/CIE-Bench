    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the newly added mission control elements (such as consoles, screens, or panels) geometrically consistent with the room's perspective and do not appear to float or clip through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mission control elements are added in a way that complements the room's perspective. They are aligned with the floor and walls in such a way that they appear to be part of the original scene. The consoles, screens, and panels fit seamlessly into the environment without floating or intersecting unrealistically with other surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the color-coded sections for training stages (e.g., Physical Training, Technical Skills) have clean edges and are they positioned so they do not overlap or obscure the astronaut’s suit or feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color-coded sections for the training stages in Image B are clearly defined and positioned below the astronaut. The sections have clean edges and are placed at the bottom of the image, ensuring they do not interfere with or obscure any part of the astronaut's suit or feet, maintaining a tidy and organized appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative icons (e.g., treadmill, simulator) proportionally sized and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut so they do not appear oversized or misplaced in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrative icons in Image B are appropriately sized, maintaining a scale that is coherent with the rest of the image. They are placed at distances that ensure they relate logically to the astronaut without appearing disproportionately large or improperly positioned within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the explanatory text for each training stage clearly readable, properly aligned, and not overlapping with the astronaut’s body or suit components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explanatory text for the training stages in Image B is legible, well-aligned, and placed strategically in the image where it does not overlap with the astronaut or the suit. The text maintains good spacing and alignment ensuring readability and coherence in presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s suit joints (e.g., elbows, knees), gloves, and helmet fully intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The astronaut’s suit, including the joints at elbows and knees, gloves, and helmet, appears intact in Image B. There is no visible distortion or warping, and the texture details of the suit remain consistent and high-quality throughout, suggesting no issues with the edits applied to other areas.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the added mission control elements (e.g., consoles, icons) align with the direction of the original ceiling lighting and do not contradict the existing shadow patterns on the floor and astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows from the added elements are aligned with the assumed light direction from the ceiling lights. These shadows are consistent with the existing patterns cast on the floor and the astronaut, ensuring there is no contradiction in the lighting effects present in the scene.",
