      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature proportionally scaled with rounded, simplified features that maintain their identifiable characteristics without distorted limbs or facial structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature exhibit rounded, simplified proportions typical of chibi style, which often exaggerates features while maintaining the recognizable attributes of characters. The limbs and facial structures are accurately represented, with the large eyes and distinctive color scheme of Ultraman, as well as the creatureâ€™s recognizable shape and expression. This analysis combines an understanding of chibi art style, which focuses on maintaining identifiable traits while simplifying and scaling down physical features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the chibi figures exhibit a consistent, smooth, glossy finish without visible texture breaks, uneven highlights, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the chibi figures, including Ultraman and the creature, are smooth and glossy, characteristic of toy-like figures. The lighting highlights are consistent and natural across the surfaces without texture breaks or uneven brightness, indicating good rendering quality. Glossy surfaces reflect light uniformly, which aligns with the observation that the figures maintain a polished look free from texture anomalies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering dust particles evenly distributed in the air around the chibi figures, forming a soft, swirling motion that blends naturally with the background mist without clumping or artificial trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dust particles in Image B appear to be evenly distributed and create a sparkling effect that simulates a magical or dynamic atmosphere around the chibi figures. The particles mesh seamlessly with the background mist, enhancing the depth and ambiance without forming unnatural clumps or trails, suggesting careful attention to detail in the particle system rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the outer globe clearly defined with a transparent spherical shape that contains all internal elements, and do the etched cosmic patterns on its surface appear correctly aligned and non-distorted across the curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a globe encapsulating the scene. This globe is visually transparent and spherical, adequately containing the figures and background elements without exceeding its boundaries. The cosmic patterns provide a starry backdrop, aligned with the globe's curvature, free from distortion, indicating precise design alignment and attention to spherical perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature detailed metallic debris and rugged terrain that support the scene's scale and contrast with the chibi figures, without floating or misplaced objects or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is characterized by metallic debris and rugged terrain, providing a realistic contrast to the playful chibi figures by grounding the scene. These elements are correctly placed, with no seeming floating or displacement, and consistent lighting matches the overall scene, contributing to the authenticity and scale of the environment.",
