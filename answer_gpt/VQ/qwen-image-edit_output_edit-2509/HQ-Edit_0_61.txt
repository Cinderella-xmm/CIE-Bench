    "Question": "Q1: Does the table appear transformed into a tea box lid with consistent geometry and engraved leaf patterns that follow natural contours without warping or breaking the surface structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a tea box lid with engraved leaf patterns. The geometry of these engravings is consistent, and the patterns follow natural contours without any visible warping or breaking of the surface structure. The natural look is maintained and aligned with common design aesthetics for an engraved surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the replaced cups depicted with clear, detailed sustainable material textures (such as fibrous or layered patterns) that appear natural and integrated into the scene without visible artifacts or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The cups in Image B are illustrated on the label of the tea box, showing varying simple, clear designs. They do not appear to depict fibrous or layered sustainable material textures. The simplicity of the illustration avoids detailed texture rendering, making it less integrated into a naturally realistic design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the tag with the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the scene’s aesthetic, and seamlessly integrated with proper lighting and shadow alignment to avoid appearing pasted on?",
    "explanation": "The tag in Image B shows the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' in a legible manner. The style is in line with the natural and minimalistic aesthetic typical of a calming tea product and does not appear to be pasted on, due to proper alignment and consistent design with the tea box.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the teapot reshaped into a leaf contour with smooth, continuous edges and natural-looking earthy textures that do not show distortion, clipping, or unnatural color gradients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is reshaped into a leaf contour. The edges appear smooth and continuous, with a natural earthy texture that avoids distortion or clipping. The color gradients support a natural leaf appearance, aligning well with natural characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements (tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, leaf-shaped teapot) align with the original lighting direction and cast consistent shadows, maintaining spatial harmony and depth without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting direction appears consistent across the tea box lid, brand tag, and leaf-shaped teapot. These elements do not show misalignment or floating issues, maintaining spatial harmony and depth in the composition. However, since the sustainable cups are illustrated as part of the branding rather than physical objects in the scene, they don’t impact shadows or alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
