      "question": "Do the transitions between the front, left side, and rear views of the car appear smooth and free of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is presented with three different perspectives: front, left side, and rear. Analyzing these views involves assessing whether the lines and curves of the car appear consistent and fluent as the image transitions between these perspectives. Observing the placement of features like the headlights, grill, and spoiler can indicate the smoothness of transitions. The perspectives should logically flow without any angular distortion or mismatched elements which would suggest poor transition. The visual coherence suggests proper and natural transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the car parts consistent and logical across the three views without showing any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, evaluating the proportions and angles involves checking each perspective for consistency in size and alignment of key features like the wheels, body panels, and windows. Logical consistency means that a feature's positioning or size change should match the expected perspective change (front to side to rear), not suggest disproportion or deformation. Each view should keep the car proportional, without skewing or warping that would detract from realism, which is visibly correct across all views.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car's surface texture and material properties, like reflections and shine, appear uniform and realistic across all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the surface texture involves observing the car's paint, gloss, and how it reflects light. Consistency would mean that the car's finish should have similar reflective properties in each perspective, signifying a uniform material quality. The car demonstrates even reflections, gloss, indicative of a consistent and realistic application of surface texture in these conditions, adding to the realism across views.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow effects consistent and correctly aligned across all three views of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, examining the lighting and shadows entails ensuring these aspects resonate across all different perspectives of the car. This requires congruent shadow directions, intensity, and light source simulation, matching the environmental lighting. Each view should exhibit similar shadow shapes and directions aligning with the car elements' expected form, enhancing realistic depiction, evidenced by consistent lighting conditions in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background seamlessly integrate with the car without introducing any jarring inconsistencies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, evaluating integration of background with the car involves ensuring that shadows, lighting, and presence do not disrupt overall coherence. Smooth integration means the car doesn't appear artificially inserted; the environmental details like plants, garage, and driveway should support the car's natural placement. The mingling of elements without distinct cut-off lines or unusual shadowing suggests a seamless background integration as one cohesive scene is depicted.",
