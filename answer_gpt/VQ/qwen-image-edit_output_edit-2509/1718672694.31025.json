      "question": "Do the two central tree trunks retain the original towers' vertical proportions and cylindrical form without unnatural tapering or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two large tree trunks seemingly replacing the towers seen in Image A. The trunks maintain a vertical structure consistent with the cylindrical form of the original towers, showcasing a natural taper seen in tree trunks. The absence of distorted geometry suggests an intention to replicate the verticality of the towers, albeit in a natural, tree-like fashion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches extending from the trunks seamlessly connected and positioned in a way that follows natural growth patterns, without floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branches appear to be an organic outgrowth from the central trunks, extending in directions suggesting natural growth. The seamless connection of these branches is evident as they do not show signs of being disconnected or floating unnaturally in space. Their placement follows typical tree growth patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing leaves at the top of the structure emit a soft, diffused green light that blends with ambient lighting and does not produce sharp halos or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing leaves in Image B emit a subtle green glow, which appears to blend well with the surrounding ambient light. The light emitted is soft and diffused, evident by the absence of sharp halos or overexposed sections around the leaves, maintaining a harmonious visual effect with the scene lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the root-like spirit figures embedded in the ground smoothly blended with the terrain and free of visible pixelation, edge artifacts, or unnatural translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spirit figures in Image B are depicted with a smooth integration into the terrain. Their edges show a level of translucency that appears natural, without visible pixelation or edge artifacts. The blending with the ground is consistent and does not present any discrepancies in terms of visual continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark textures on the trunks and branches show variation in shading and detail consistent with real tree surfaces, without uniform patterns or repeated brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bark textures on the trunks and branches in Image B display a natural variation in shading and details typical of real tree surfaces. Each segment of the trunk has unique patterns that do not repeat in the manner of artificial brushwork, indicating an effort to emulate authentic tree bark texture.",
