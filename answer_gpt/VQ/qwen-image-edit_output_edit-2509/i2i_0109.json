      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plastic figurine of the character maintains correct and balanced proportions typical of a superhero figure. The limbs and torso are of a size and shape consistent with the portrayal of a strong and muscular character, such as Thor. There are no visible distortions or awkward angles suggesting broken geometric shapes. The continuity and symmetry of the body's lines are well-preserved, which is crucial for maintaining physical rationality and the overall recognizable form of the character in model representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting effects in Image B, especially the glow emanating from the hammer and the reflected light on the desk, are consistent with the direction and intensity expected from a single light source. There are no abrupt or overly harsh shadow edges or excessively bright highlights on the figurine that would break the naturalism. The lighting carefully integrates into the scene's ambiance, enhancing visual realism without introducing artifacts that could disrupt the cohesiveness of the lighting interaction with the physical objects in view.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the figurine in Image B are crafted to hold the hammer in a natural pose, maintaining realistic human hand structures familiar to viewers. There are five fingers per hand; each finger is correctly shaped and positioned without any signs of anatomical distortion or unrealistic textures. This is typical of high-quality figurines where the sculpting accurately reflects expected human proportions and dexterity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the plastic figurine retained a structurally sound head and face consistent with the character's identity, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While Image B features a blurred face, it doesnâ€™t hinder the assessment that otherwise, the figurine retains a structurally sound head associated with a typical superhero form. Given the rest of its body and contextual elements, the figurine presents a cohesive representation consistent with what one would expect for Thor. The blurriness is external to these structural aspects; thus, it does not imply any noticeable anatomical inconsistencies or textural oddities in the non-blurred components.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the armor and cape of the plastic figurine appear cohesive with the rest of the figurine, avoiding any unnatural textures or materials that disrupt the visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor and cape of the figurine are well-integrated into the overall design. The textures and colors are visually credible and consistent with materials such as cloth and metal. There's no indication of material inconsistency or visual disruption between these elements and the rest of the figurine. They contribute to the realism and visual integrity, maintaining a smooth, uninterrupted representation in line with the character's known visual attributes.",
