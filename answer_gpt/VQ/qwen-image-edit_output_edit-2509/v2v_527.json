      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO representation of the dog in Image B appears to be well-constructed and lacks any noticeable distortions or artifacts. The shape and proportions are consistent with those of a typical LEGO model, known for their blocky but coherent design. The dog is depicted sitting on the stop sign in a balanced manner, which aligns with the typical LEGO construction standards. Therefore, the structural consistency and visual credibility are maintained.",

      "question": "Does the gradient shading used for the sky and clouds preserve their natural appearance and depth without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background featuring the sky and clouds appears consistent with a high-quality visual depiction. The gradient shading looks smooth, creating an impression of depth and natural appearance. LEGO-style representations often mimic real-life scenes while maintaining a clean, simplified look, which this image achieves without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stop sign in Image B is represented in a LEGO style, yet it retains its proper octagonal shape and proportions. The lettering appears clear and is uniformly placed, consistent with how a real stop sign would appear, albeit in a simplified form. There is no indication of distorted or broken geometric shapes, maintaining physical rationality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the base and nameplate free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base and nameplate in Image B appear smooth and free from any unnatural textures or artifacts. They are depicted in a manner consistent with a professional display stand, which emphasizes clean lines and a polished finish. This maintains visual credibility and aligns with the expected quality for a display to present a LEGO figure.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosure preserve its authenticity and natural appearance, without introducing any visual distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cube enclosure that houses the LEGO representation of the stop sign and dog appears clear, with no visual distortions or artifacts. The transparency is well-executed, allowing the scene inside to be viewed without any obstruction, similarly reflecting how glass should behave in reality. The clean edges and absence of distortion ensure the authenticity of the enclosure is maintained.",
