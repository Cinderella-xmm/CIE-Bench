      "question": "Does the line-art representation of the elderly man maintain accurate proportions and natural joint alignment in his tai chi stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line-art depiction of the elderly man features well-maintained proportions, capturing the realistic positioning typical of tai chi stances. The joints appear naturally aligned, as the traditional posture is represented accurately. Utilizing knowledge of human anatomy and tai chi movements, the depiction aligns with common tai chi poses, which emphasize balance and fluidity.",

      "question": "Are the pastel watercolor tones applied uniformly across the scene, preserving smooth gradients and avoiding harsh edges or inconsistent color zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features pastel watercolor tones that blend seamlessly across the depicted scene, demonstrating smooth gradients typical of watercolor art. The application appears consistent, without abrupt transitions or color zones that deviate from the unified design aesthetic. This examination stems from an understanding of watercolor techniques, which usually involve well-distributed hues and soft edges.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom patterns integrated naturally into the background, maintaining depth and perspective consistency with the existing trees and mist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom patterns appear well integrated into the background. Despite Image B's illustration style differing from Image A's photo-realism, it still maintains a sense of depth and follows the foreground-to-background transition evident in similar art styles. A shared visual theme supports consistency and perspective alignment between the blossoms and the existing misty landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the date grids placed in a way that respects the spatial boundaries of the scene, such as being anchored to the ground or wall without overlapping the manâ€™s body or distorting his silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The date grids in Image B are strategically positioned to avoid interference with the man's silhouette. They are anchored to their designated spaces below the main illustration without overlapping or distorting the figure's pose, respecting spatial boundaries. This understanding involves recognizing graphical layout principles where elements should not disrupt central visuals.",

      "question": "Does the hand forming the \"OK\" gesture have exactly five fingers, with natural joint curvature and no elongated, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the man's hand forming the 'OK' gesture consists of a thumb and four fingers, totaling five digits. The illustration maintains natural joint curvature respecting human anatomy. Despite the simplicity inherent in line art, it accurately captures the realistic positioning and orientation of a human hand.",
