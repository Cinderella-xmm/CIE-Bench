      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy still clearly visible as a circular object centered within the intended eye area, with white foamy textures extending outward like lashes without breaking the circle's outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange lifebuoy is no longer visible as a circular object. Instead, it has been transformed into a detailed eye-like feature of a creature, with the iris and details such as eyelashes, which do not resemble the white foamy textures. This indicates that the original lifebuoy has been modified and integrated into the character design of the creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the netting sections along the shoreline transformed into soft, undulating fin shapes with gradual transitions from mesh to organic form, lacking sharp angles or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, there are netting sections along the shoreline which appear structured and with defined edges. In Image B, these netting sections have been replaced by smooth fin shapes that transition organically from what might have initially been netting to part of the creatureâ€™s design. This transformation results in a seamless, gradual transition from the initial object to the organic form, lacking sharp angles or pixelated edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline curve smoothly into a continuous, rounded body shape with wave-like ridges embedded in the sand, without sudden kinks or flat regions disrupting the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the original shoreline from Image A has been artistically transformed into a rounded body shape of a creature. The body is designed to have a smooth, continuous curvature, mimicking the natural flow of waves and ridges, which ensures no sudden kinks or flat regions. This transformation supports the portrayal of a fluid, organic form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sea-green markings distributed evenly across the sandy surface with soft, diffused edges and no visible pixels, overlays, or repeating patterns that suggest artificial addition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandy surface has been artistically altered to include sea-green markings that have soft, diffused edges, consistent across the body of the creature. The markings appear organic and naturally integrated into the design, with no visible pixelation or artificial overlay effects. This gives an impression of naturally occurring patterns rather than artificial additions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eye (lifebuoy), fins (netting), and body (shoreline) align in a way that suggests a single, cohesive organism with logical proportions and no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the components formerly known as the lifebuoy, netting, and shoreline in Image A have been transformed into elements of a cohesive creature. The eye, fins, and body are proportionately designed to form a logical and unified creature, without any component appearing floating or misaligned. This transformation maintains the overall integrity and artistic vision of a single, cohesive organism.",
