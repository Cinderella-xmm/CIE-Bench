      "question": "Do the cartoon versions of the two boys have proportionally correct head shapes and facial features that align with typical human anatomy, without exaggerated or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon versions of the boys have simplified and exaggerated features, which is typical for cartoon art styles meant to be playful and engaging. Their heads and facial features, although not adhering strictly to human anatomy, are consistent with common cartoon stylization aimed at emphasizing expression and character identity. In such art styles, proportional accuracy is not prioritized. Hence, the cartoon versions do not align with typical human anatomy or geometry.",

      "question": "Are the cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements rendered with consistent material textures and lighting that match the surrounding environment, avoiding glossy or flat-painted artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The furniture in Image B displays vibrant colors typical of cartoons, with cyan and lemon yellow shades contributes to a lively atmosphere.

The rendering corresponds to a consistent cartoon environment where lighting and textures aren't required to be realistic, preventing the appearance of glossy or flat-painted artifacts through intentional simplicity.",

      "question": "Are the floating books and animated tablet screen positioned in a way that respects spatial depth and casting appropriate shadows, ensuring they appear physically plausible within the classroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floating items such as books and tablet screens are characteristic of fantasy or animated sequences, allowing them to defy realistic physical laws like gravity and shadows. This approach isn't physically plausible in a real-world context. Their positioning enhances the magical and imaginative essence of the setting but does not respect spatial depth or cast shadows as objects do in reality.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents robots and gadgets with a distinct cartoon style. Their scale relative to the children fits within this playful environment, and their surfaces are smoothly rendered. No digital artifacts or issues such as aliasing or missing textures are visible. This smoothness and consistency maintain the integrity of the digital art style, ensuring a cohesive appearance within the cartoon setting.",
