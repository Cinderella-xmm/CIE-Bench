    "Question": "Q1: Has the removal of the second zebra and grassland resulted in a clean transition without visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of a second zebra or grassland that might have been present in Image A. The space occupied by the current zebra and the surrounding area shows no irregularities or evidence of editing such as rough edges or mismatched colors, suggesting a clean transition during the removal process. The consistent background color and smooth boundaries around the zebra indicate that this area was edited successfully, maintaining a natural look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the green gradient plane replacing the grass blend seamlessly with the zebra and ground, maintaining natural gradients and avoiding sharp contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green gradient plane replaces the grass, and it transitions smoothly from a lighter to a darker shade of green, providing a gradual change without sharp line differences. This visual continuity helps the gradient blend well with the rest of the image, particularly with the zebra figure, ensuring it does not stand out awkwardly against the ground.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the zebra on the left intact and proportionally correct, with no signs of distortion or unnatural texture?",
    "explanation": "The zebra on the left in Image B appears well proportioned with no visual signs of stretching, squeezing, or any geometric distortion. The lines and curves of the zebra are smooth, and its overall shape corresponds accurately to a realistic zebra's anatomy, maintaining natural proportions and textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the details of the zebra's stripes and the ground's texture well-preserved, ensuring high-quality representation without loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The zebra's stripes in Image B are sharp, well-defined, and maintain clarity with crisp edges. Additionally, the ground's minimal visible texture shows consistent quality without evident loss of detail. This preservation of detail ensures that both the zebra and elements of the surrounding area are presented in high-quality representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the final composition effectively convey a calm and solitary atmosphere without any elements disrupting the visual harmony?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a solitary figure of a zebra, complemented by a smooth gradient background devoid of visual clutter or additional distracting elements. The absence of any disruptive features or contrasting details allows the image to maintain a serene and singular focus, contributing to a tranquil and solitary atmosphere.",
    "answer": "Yes"
