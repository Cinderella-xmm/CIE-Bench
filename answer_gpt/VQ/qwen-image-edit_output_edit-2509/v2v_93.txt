    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer is depicted using a 3D cartoon style which still retains its round shape and the positioning of the markings and needle remain clear. The structural integrity has been well-preserved, as there are no signs of distortions or broken geometric shapes. The circular form and the incremented markings align with common visual representations of thermometers, suggesting consistent structural design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are soft lighting effects applied to the thermometer's metallic surface that appear natural. The light reflects off the metal in a way that enhances its shiny finish, creating a realistic metallic look. The details such as the temperature markings and the degree symbol are still crisp and clear, indicating that there is no unnatural texture or loss of details due to the lighting effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] are positioned neatly to the sides of the thermometer, utilizing space efficiently without overlapping or causing clutter. They are clearly legible and complement the existing design elements, maintaining the image's organization and coherence. This suggests the stats are naturally integrated into the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner 'Precison Thermal Gauge' and nameplate 'Thermonometer' are positioned clearly at the top and bottom, respectively. They are visually distinct from the central image and information, which maintains clarity and improves the visual hierarchy. The text is readable and does not interfere with the main image of the thermometer, suggesting a logical and consistent layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cool-toned background and crisp white borders create a neat and organized frame around the thermometer image. The background color enhances the professional appearance, aligning with the scientific and technical function of the thermometer. There are no visual disruptions or artifacts present, maintaining an authentic and polished look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
