    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes added to the cake positioned naturally on the surface without distorting the shape or texture of the meringue domes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes have been added to the cake in a cartoon style. The positioning does not adhere naturally to the contours or texture of the meringue domes, as they are placed prominently without consideration for the cake's original surface characteristics. This is typical in cartoon illustrations where stylization overrides realistic depiction.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the cake shaking its head in the cartoon suggests movement that does not preserve the rigidity typical of a real cake's structure. The layers are flexing as part of the illustration’s narrative and context, which is a common characteristic in animated scenes.",
