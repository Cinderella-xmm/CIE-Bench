    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bust have a visibly coherent head-to-body proportion where the head is enlarged relative to the torso but remains structurally plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size of the head relative to the torso is larger than realistic proportions in human anatomy, aligning with the common artistic style of chibi figures. In such figures, an enlarged head is a typical feature, enhancing the cuteness and character of the sculpture. This stylistic choice makes the proportions structurally plausible within the context of the aesthetic and design intentions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features simplified but still clearly defined, with no missing or distorted elements such as eyes or mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are blurred and cannot be assessed in terms of simplification or clarity. Hence, due to the blur, one cannot confirm the presence or definition of facial features such as eyes or mouth.",

      "question": "Do the embroidered patterns on the robe appear continuous and logically structured, without jagged edges or disrupted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embroidered patterns on the robe in Image B appear to be smoothly integrated into the design with continuous lines and coherent structures. The patterns are detailed and intricately produced, typical of digital illustrations with high resolution, displaying a polished appearance without disruptions in texture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the headdress are painted with vibrant colors and appear evenly spaced. There are no visible artifacts like color bleeding or misalignment, indicating a clean and precise design typical of well-crafted digital artwork or sculpture decoration.",

      "question": "Does the pomegranate have a glossy surface with natural-looking highlights that do not distort its shape or create false reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pomegranate in Image B features a glossy surface with highlights that enhance its visual appeal. The shine looks natural, reflecting light in a way consistent with shiny objects, without any distortion to its overall shape or creating false reflections.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B appears to be firmly connected to the bust, with no visible gaps or misalignment. It provides a stable and visually grounded foundation for the sculpture, a typical characteristic of well-designed bases in decorative busts.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the pomegranate distinctly shows five fingers, and they are positioned at natural angles that are typical for gripping objects. The fingers appear without any deformation, maintaining anatomical correctness despite the simplified artistic style.",
