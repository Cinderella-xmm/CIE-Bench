    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders sharp and unaltered by the added shadowy textures or angular lines, with no visible distortion or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the man's head, cap, and shoulders are accentuated by shadowy textures and angular lines, giving them a stylized appearance compared to Image A. The altered shadows are part of the intended effect, creating a thematic atmosphere that supports the 'mystery' aspect in conjunction with the title. These added elements do not destroy continuity but integrate depth and dynamics into the image, as seen in noir-style artistic covers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Gray Mystery\" positioned outside the man’s face and cap area, and does it not partially cover or obscure any facial features or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Gray Mystery' is strategically placed above the man’s cap, avoiding overlap with physical features such as the man's head or clothing. The clear separation and position in the upper section keep all human and clothing elements distinct, leaving the imagery below the text uninterrupted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass appear integrated into the background without intersecting or distorting the man’s head or shoulders, and do they maintain consistent depth relative to the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cityscape and magnifying glass in Image B are seamlessly blended into the background. These elements are portrayed with silhouettes, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or disrupting the silhouette of the man’s head or shoulders. The composition maintains perspective and focus on the foreground, consistent with dramatic poster designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skin tones, facial hair, and fabric textures of the cap and shirt still visible and consistent with their original appearance, without unnatural yellowing or fading due to the sepia effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adopts a sepia effect, inherently altering the original colors of the man’s skin, facial hair, and clothing, adding a vintage aesthetic. The colors have changed to match the visual theme; however, this is an artistic choice rather than an unintentional alteration or degradation of the image’s quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray cap and shirt display consistent fabric texture and weave pattern, with no visible artifacts such as blurring, noise, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized approach in Image B introduces some texture changes as part of the artwork, but it maintains a coherent fabric pattern that suggests a consistent aesthetic choice rather than unintended artifacts. While the style suppresses intricate fabric details like in Image A, it does so deliberately to fit an illustrative format and does not introduce typical issues like blurring or noise.",
