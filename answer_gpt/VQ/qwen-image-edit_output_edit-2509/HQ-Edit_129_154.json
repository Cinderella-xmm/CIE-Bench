    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crown-like head in Image B is crafted to appear like a crown, which suggests that it was adapted from the teapot lid in Image A. Analyzing Image B, the crown shows smooth edges, without signs of distortion or broken geometry. The metallic surface appears consistently smooth and polished, resembling the surface of the original teapot lid. The craftsmanship implies a seamless integration of shapes while preserving the metallic properties.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the teapot's spout is transformed into a beak, the metallic surface is examined for continuity and texture. Observing the beak structure, it appears smooth without visible cracks or unnatural bends. The texture and curvature are consistent, maintaining the teapot's original metallic surface quality, indicating a successful transformation without disrupting the surface characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle of the teapot is re-imagined as the owl's tail. Evaluating the tail's curvature, it appears smoothly integrated with proportional alignment to the owl's body. The curve is natural without abrupt angles, and the metallic surface remains consistent with the rest of the owl's body, suggesting careful adaptation in maintaining style and material consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl in Image B presents mechanical eyes placed symmetrically. Evaluating these eyes, they maintain balance with visible cogs, and a soft, controlled glow. There is an absence of halos or color bleeding, and the eyes' appearance integrates seamlessly into the metallic facial structure, demonstrating attention to texture and color harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the owl perched on a wooden branch. Assessing the integration, the branch's texture is finely detailed with consistent wood grain patterns. The shadowing around the branch is coherent, casting realistic shadows and adding depth. The overall presentation complements the scene naturally, resembling the consistent textural context seen in Image A with the table surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body's engraved patterns are transformed to resemble feathers. Examining these patterns, they exhibit clear, detailed feather-like textures with uniform layering and directionality. The image maintains high resolution without pixelation or loss of detail, signifying an effective transformation that retains the metallic intricacy and design.",
