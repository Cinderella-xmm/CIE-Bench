      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle towers are transformed into crystal structures, and the facets seem to be neatly aligned with a uniform geometric pattern. The surfaces appear smooth, without any jagged or incomplete edges. When analyzing the towers, the clean and consistent alignment of facets matches typical expectations for a crafted crystal object, thereby reflecting precision in design. This gives the impression of a well-designed structure rather than a rough or incomplete one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gemstones appear instead of seashells, placed on what looks like a smooth surface rather than sand or water. These gemstones are arranged meticulously, staying true to their positions relative to the seashells in Image A. They have smooth, reflective surfaces, enhancing the illusion of solid, well-crafted gems rather than incomplete or floating objects. This suggests a meticulous effort to replace the seashells with gemstones in a realistic manner.",

      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a frosted glass background with a wave pattern. This pattern appears continuous and fluid, portraying a natural wave motion similar to ripples on water. The design does not exhibit any abrupt breaks or disjointed lines that interrupt the flow, maintaining an elegant and cohesive visual. Such a continuity in wave patterns indicates a deliberate artistic effort to depict a serene sea backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case’s edges are clearly visible and appear straight, without any signs of clipping or distortion of internal elements. The alignment of these edges with the castle's perspective confirms adherence to logical geometric principles of perspective. This demonstrates a coherent and accurate depiction of the display case within the 3D space.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldn’t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red shovel with the yellow handle from Image A is absent in Image B, replaced by the display case containing the crystal castle and gemstone elements. Since the shovel is not visibly present, it cannot be assessed for visibility or distortion in Image B. Thus, its presence or potential placement outside the context of glass interaction is not observable here.",
