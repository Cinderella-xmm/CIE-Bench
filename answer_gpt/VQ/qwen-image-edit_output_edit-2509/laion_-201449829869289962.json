      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome glass case in Image B appears to be smooth and transparent, as expected for a realistic glass display, where light interacts with its surface and curves naturally. This is evident from the reflections and the clear visibility of the scene inside without noticeable distortions or artifacts along the edges suggesting stitching or warping. This realistic appearance is essential for maintaining the illusion of a seamless glass material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church tower, roof, and nearby buildings all appear to have been uniformly scaled down. They maintain their relative proportions, which would suggest the use of consistent reduction techniques. This uniformity is important to preserve the integrity of the architectural features when transforming them into a miniature diorama.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The additional small houses in Image B appear to be consistent with the traditional European architectural style seen in the original building. They have appropriately shaped roofs and windows that match well with the existing structures and show no obvious signs of texture distortion or deformation. Maintaining stylistic coherence is crucial for a harmonized scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper roof in Image B exhibits texture variations and subtle color changes, akin to oxidation effects seen in real copper over time. This careful attention to detail is reflected in how the roof reacts to lighting, enhancing the realism of the material representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mist in Image B is depicted as spreading gradually across the distant mountains, displaying a smooth transition in opacity. This avoids any sharp edges or disjointed patterns, providing a natural and realistic atmospheric effect typically expected in a misty landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold pedestal is directly underneath the base of the diorama, appearing solid and properly aligned. This grounding ensures that the diorama appears stable and well-supported, essential for a cohesive visual presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terraced vineyards in Image B exhibit consistent spacing and maintain a natural curvature, avoiding any grid-like appearance. The edges are smooth, without signs of pixelation, enhancing the realism of the landscape depiction within the diorama.",
