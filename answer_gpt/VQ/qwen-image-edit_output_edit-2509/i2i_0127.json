      "question": "Does the addition of the \"Clean First\" slogan in the top left corner maintain the natural appearance and does not introduce any obvious artifacts like blurry edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Clean First' slogan appears in the top left corner with a blue background that curves smoothly into the tiled area of the wall. The edges of the design are sharp and do not display any noticeable blur. The lighting on the text and the surrounding blue shape is consistent with the lighting of the rest of the image, suggesting a coherent integration. Based on these observations, the added slogan maintains a natural appearance without introducing visual artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the \"Comfort Always\" slogan added in the bottom right corner visually credible, maintaining structural consistency and not causing any distortion or degradation of the surrounding tiles' texture and details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Comfort Always' slogan in the bottom right corner of Image B is integrated with a similar blue background. The surrounding tiles appear undistorted with no visible changes in texture or details. The text placement and design do not compromise the structural integrity of the tiled background, and the edges remain crisp. Therefore, the addition is visually credible and maintains consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the fonts and styles of both slogans blend naturally with the background, avoiding any unnatural textures or interruptions in the tile patterns behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts used for both slogans are clear, simple, and modern, which blends well with the minimalist and functional design of a bathroom setting. They do not disrupt the tile patterns or introduce any unnatural textures. The blue background of each slogan is separated from the tile patterns, thus avoiding any interruptions. The choice of font and style complements the existing setting, ensuring a harmonious look.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sizes and placements of the \"Clean First\" and \"Comfort Always\" slogans create a balanced composition that complements the image without overwhelming the toilet and its setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sizes of the slogans are moderate and do not overshadow the main subject of the image, which is the toilet. The placement at the top left and bottom right corner provides a balanced presence within the image, ensuring both the text and the plumbing fixture receive visual attention. This thoughtful composition maintains visual balance and supports the natural flow of the image.",

      "question": "Are the slogans aligned in a way that respects the geometric shapes of the tiled walls and floor, ensuring the structural and visual coherence of the entire image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both slogans in Image B are positioned in such a way that they do not overlap with any individual tile, maintaining the visual grid formed by the tiles. The curved edges of the blue backgrounds are designed not to clash with the straight, geometric lines of the tiles, thereby respecting the existing grid structure. This alignment supports both the structural and visual coherence of the image.",
