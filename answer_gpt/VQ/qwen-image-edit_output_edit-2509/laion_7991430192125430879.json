      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bottle in Image B appears to be constructed using uniformly sized and aligned LEGO bricks that form a consistent cylindrical shape. There are no visible signs of warping or misalignment between the bricks, which would typically manifest as uneven surfaces or bricks sticking out irregularly. This suggests that the construction is precise and follows the contours of an ideal cylindrical object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all brand text elements (e.g., \"BACARDÍ\", \"MOJITO\") and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation of the label contains the brand text 'BACARDÍ' and 'MOJITO.' These text elements appear well-rendered using LEGO bricks, maintaining clear, identifiable characters without distortion or missing parts. The alignment of the text is coherent and comparable to traditional printed labels, although it might lack the precision and sharpness of a printed font.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO cap as being constructed with bricks, giving it a cylindrical appearance. The height and diameter appear consistent with the neck of the bottle, despite being a LEGO construction, which naturally introduces some angularity to its form. The top of the cap, however, is not entirely smooth or rounded due to the inherent block-based nature of LEGO bricks, leading to subtle angular breaks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white shelf on which the LEGO bottle sits appears to be a flat and horizontal surface. There are no visible irregular edges or segments that would suggest misalignment or integration issues within the scene. The overall setup provides a consistent base for the bottle, indicating proper placement and rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the smaller text elements such as \"natural mint flavor\" and \"Simply pour over ice\" fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the challenge with small text elements like 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' rendered in LEGO form is maintaining legibility and correct spacing. Due to the medium's limitations, such small text would typically lose its clarity, and in this LEGO bottle, these smaller text details are not fully visible or adequately represented. The precision needed for small lettering exceeds the resolution possible with LEGO bricks, leading to overlapping or broken lettering, making it less discernible.",
