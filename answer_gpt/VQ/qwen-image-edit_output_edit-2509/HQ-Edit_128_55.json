      "question": "Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathered wing extensions added to the sides of the door differ significantly from the original wood material. The wings have a feather-like texture with patterns that resemble bird wings, rather than wood grain. The transition from the door to the wings is not consistent with the carving depth of the wood, and thus, they do not exhibit smooth transitions as posed by the original panel edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a transformed figure with a face that has been modified, and the area where the eyes might be is blurred, not shimmering. The image does not depict floating or misaligned eyes, and instead, it maintains a focus on the drawn character without specific detail in this area. Consequently, there are no visual cues to conclude the alignment with the original iron studs from the door.",

      "question": "Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The celestial crown depicted in Image B appears to emerge from the top of the figure's head, and it does not mirror any elements from Image A. There is no continuity of curvature from the original arch in the crown's design, nor is there a seamless transition from the arch to the crown. These additions do not maintain the arch's original shape, as they are distinct and separate elements hovering above the figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the etched runes visible across the doorâ€™s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the etched runes are visible across the surface of the character and not the door. These runes are illuminated compared to the original carving patterns of the door. This distinct contrast in color and lighting indicates that the etched runes are significantly different from the original wood carvings, which were not illuminated. As a result, the etched runes do not maintain the original depth, color, or consistency.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloak-like structure in Image B is detailed with fabric folds, shadowing, and highlights that give the appearance of natural fabric texture. It hangs around the figure, creating a new visual frame separate from the original stone doorframe. While the fabric appears well-rendered, it does not show direct integration into the stonework; however, it does not exhibit visible gaps or distortions around where it joins the stone frame.",
