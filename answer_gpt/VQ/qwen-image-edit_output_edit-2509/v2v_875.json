      "question": "Are the edges of the palm tree and cactus seamlessly integrated into the Polaroid frame without visible artifacts or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The integration of the palm tree and cactus edges into the Polaroid frame appears smooth in the edited image. The edges look natural with no visible artifacts or breaks, which suggests that they are seamlessly placed within the frame, appearing as if they belong to the photograph within the Polaroid.",

      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style cactus maintain its original green color and texture, avoiding unnatural color shifts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style cactus in the edited image displays a consistent green color and texture that resembles that of a real cactus. There is no sign of unusual color shifts or loss of texture details, as the surface of the cactus appears smooth and vibrant, retaining the typical characteristics of a cactus.",

      "question": "Does the human hand holding the Polaroid photograph appear anatomically correct with natural skin texture and no more than five fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human hand in the edited image looks natural with well-defined skin texture and appropriate shading. It appears anatomically correct, with fingers positioned realistically around the Polaroid, and importantly, there are no more than five fingers visible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition where the 3D chibi-style cactus appears to break out of the Polaroid frame smooth and believable, without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition where the 3D chibi-style cactus appears to break out of the Polaroid frame is implemented smoothly in the edited image. The cactus seamlessly exits the boundary of the frame, without any visible distortions or breaks in its geometry, giving a convincing 3D effect.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the palm tree, cactus, and the 3D chibi-style cactus align naturally with the light source in the image, avoiding any artificial highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows in the edited image seem coherent and align with the light source, creating a natural appearance. Both the palm tree and regular cactus, as well as the 3D chibi-style cactus, show consistent lighting with no artificial highlights or misplaced shadows, making the scene appear unified and realistic.",
