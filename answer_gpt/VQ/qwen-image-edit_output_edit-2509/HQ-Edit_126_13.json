      "question": "Do the annotated lines representing the tea journey follow a smooth, non-intersecting path around the tea set without overlapping or deforming the original objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the annotated lines depicting the tea journey create a smooth circular path around the depicted tea set without any intersection or overlap with the objects on the table. The lines are strategically placed to avoid encroaching on the various items such as the teapot, cup, and vase, thereby maintaining the original visual integrity of these objects. The annotations enhance the narrative element of the image without disrupting its composition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the handwritten calligraphy in soft pastel green seamlessly integrated into the scene without causing visual contrast or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten calligraphy featured in Image B is presented in a soft pastel green color which blends harmoniously with the overall tone of the scene. This choice of color does not lead to a stark visual contrast against the backdrop or the objects present in the image. The calligraphy is positioned in a way that does not introduce any texture artifacts, making it well-integrated and consistent with the aesthetic of the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the minimalist icons for each step of the tea journey proportionally scaled and visually coherent with the surrounding objects and layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minimalist icons in Image B are proportionally scaled relative to the surrounding elements, such as the table and tea set. These icons maintain visual coherence with the layout, effectively representing the steps of the tea journey without overwhelming the existing objects. This proportionality ensures that the icons are informative yet understated enough to complement the scene aesthetically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added cherry blossom petals appear to float or fall naturally in the air without unnatural positioning or missing shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added cherry blossom petals are depicted in positions that suggest natural movement in the air. The placement and orientation of these petals are consistent with a gentle fall or drift, as influenced by a soft breeze, which is intelligible given the background context of a tea setting. There is no apparent issue with unnatural positioning or absence of shadows, contributing to their believability within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase preserved without visible distortion, blurring, or artificial seams where new elements were added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the textures of the elements such as the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase remain intact without any signs of distortion or blurring. The integration of new elements, such as annotations and blossom petals, does not disrupt the existing texture or introduce artificial seams. These elements appear naturally incorporated, preserving the authenticity and craftsmanship of the depicted objects.",
