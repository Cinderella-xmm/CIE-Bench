      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen emerge naturally from the phone without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic screen is depicted as projecting seamlessly from the phone held by the man. The transition from the phone to the holographic screen appears smooth, suggesting that the screen emerges naturally without visual disruption. Such design is coherent with high-tech themes where holographic devices often seem to integrate smoothly with hand-held devices.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or unnatural colors where the holographic screen connects with the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the connection point between the phone and the holographic screen maintains consistent colors and lacks artifacts. The hues in the projection match the phone's appearance, avoiding any jarred visual elements that would indicate an unnatural connection.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dimensions of the holographic projection screen match the scale of the surrounding objects in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic screen seems appropriately scaled relative to the phone and the man holding it. The screen's size complements the visual proportions in the context, aligning with depictions of personal device holograms that typically extend within a feasible range around the object.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall texture and detail of the sandwich been preserved despite the addition of the holographic screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B indicates no direct visual link or disruption involving a sandwich, as the image focuses solely on the holographic projection and does not depict or relate any elements of a sandwich. Therefore, the incorporation of the holographic screen has not affected or related to the texture of a sandwich.",

      "question": "Does the background remain consistent and undistorted by the addition of the holographic projection screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a simple, dark design that complements the futuristic holographic theme. This background remains undistorted by the addition of the screen, as no elements of the projection interfere with the integrity and clarity of the backdrop.",
