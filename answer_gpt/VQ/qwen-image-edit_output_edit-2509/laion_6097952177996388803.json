    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peaks are transformed into a fantastical creature, resulting in significant changes to their appearance. The creature is large and imposing, with horns and a muscular structure, which does not align with the original height and angularity of the mountain peaks in Image A. The transformation alters the perception of the mountain peaks, and they do appear fundamentally changed in shape and form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts complex hide patterns on what appears to be the creature born from mountain elements. The hide resembles musculature with a naturalistic appearance without tile-like patterns or noticeable digital artifacts. The textures appear organically integrated into the landscape, preserving a natural look.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy and root-like strands extend smoothly along the creature's body and the landscape with a natural flow, similar to the downhill gradient observed in Image A. They appear well-integrated with the terrain, emphasizing a harmonious transition rather than floating or forming odd clusters.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms parts of the landscape into sinewy musculature of a fantastical creature, seamlessly connecting to the adjacent slopes and maintaining the natural curves without exaggerated protrusions. The transformation shows a smooth integration with the valley providing a continuous and natural feel.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the transformed creature blend well with the surrounding landscape, maintaining consistent tonal ranges. There are no noticeable shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt the visual coherence between the creature and the environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the landscape is partially transformed, small-scale details like erosion lines and terrain texture are obscured or altered due to the fantastical creation of the creature. The focus on larger elements reduces visibility of minute terrain features that were present in Image A.",
