      "question": "Does the anime-style conversion of the athlete retain the original pose structure without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pose of the anime-style athlete mirrors that of the athlete in Image A, maintaining the crouched position with the same limb placement. The conversion to anime style does not introduce distortions in the pose, as the limbs and torso have consistent proportions relative to the original image. By examining the body posture in both images, it is evident that the pose structure remains true to the original, with no unnatural distortions visible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced facial expressions (focused eyes and light effects) integrated seamlessly into the athlete's face and do not appear as unnatural overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features anime-style enhancements such as light effects and focused eyes on the athlete's face. These adjustments are smoothly blended with the face, enhancing the anime aesthetic without seeming like separate or unnatural layers. The integration maintains the consistency of facial proportions and does not disrupt the overall appearance of the face.",

      "question": "Does the added background energy glow contribute positively to the atmosphere without causing unnatural lighting or breaking the scene's visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background energy glow in Image B introduces a dynamic element that aligns with the anime style's dramatic flair. This glow positively contributes to the atmosphere by emphasizing motion and energy around the athlete, while the lighting effect remains consistent with the scene's overall visual harmony. The addition enhances the image without causing any visual dissonance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the proportions and physical realism of the athlete’s hands, feet, and tennis racket been maintained during the style conversion, avoiding unnatural shapes or sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves the proportions of hands, feet, and the tennis racket, with similar shapes and sizes as seen in Image A. Despite the stylized approach, these elements retain a realistic look, maintaining the athletic and practical depiction without skewing proportions. By comparing elements with the original image, it's clear that realism in proportions is maintained.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character card banner format present the edited athlete in a manner that retains authenticity and visual clarity, without sacrificing the original scene’s natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The editing in Image B enhances the athlete with visual effects typical in anime-style presentations, yet these are applied in a way that uplifts the scene without detracting from its authenticity. The clarity of the actions and the setting, including the tennis court's details and athlete's pose, remains intact, achieving both anime appeal and sustaining the scene's natural form.",
