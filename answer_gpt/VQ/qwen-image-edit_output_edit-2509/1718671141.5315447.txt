    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
    "explanation": "The brass gears and copper funnels on the building's exterior in Image B appear to have a consistent material appearance with realistic metallic reflections. The surface details are evident, showcasing the texture and color expected of brass and copper materials, commonly associated with steampunk aesthetics. The reflections are smooth and clear, indicating high quality render without any artificial or pixelated textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
    "explanation": "The clock faces on the observatory dome in Image B are well-integrated into the building's spherical design. They appear to be correctly proportioned and aligned with the curvature of the dome, maintaining a coherent and symmetrical look. There is no visible warping or bending of the clock numerals or hands, suggesting careful attention to the geometric constraints of placing circular designs onto a spherical surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the steam emanating from the structure should display volumetric qualities, which would include a soft and translucent appearance. However, based on observation, there is no visible steam depicted around the building. Thus, its absence makes it impossible to evaluate as described. When present, steam should naturally rise and dissipate without harsh or defined edges, which in this image is non-evident.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
    "explanation": "The ornamental metal details in Image B are intricately woven into the design of the observatory dome. These elements are continuous, well-scaled, and seamlessly integrated without visible gaps or overlapping errors. The edges appear smooth and well-rendered, indicating a complete and polished artistic execution.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
    "explanation": "The reflection of the building in the water in Image B is symmetrical and undistorted. The image accurately mirrors the structure including the added steampunk elements like gears and clock faces. Although the reflection of steam is not observed due to its absence, the architectural elements and their detailed features can be clearly seen within the reflection, maintaining a consistent and realistic mirroring effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
