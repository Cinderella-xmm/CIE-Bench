    "Question": "Q1: Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central block has been transformed from a simple geometric shape into a detailed 3D character with facial features and limbs. This transformation indicates changes in its geometric shape from a standard rectangular block to a more complex, chibi-style cartoon character. Their rounded features diverge from the initial structure seen in Image A, which solely presented an uncomplicated rectangular geometry.",

They do not obscure the details of the cartoon characters and are appropriately scaled so as not to cause any loss of detail in the blocks or surrounding elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the red blocks and the central green block maintain a consistent chibi aesthetic without any noticeable inconsistencies in style or texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both red and green blocks have been transformed into characters with a chibi aesthetic, featuring soft edges, exaggerated facial features, and cartoonish designs. The uniformity in style and texture across these characters ensures a coherent appearance that aligns well within the chibi design scheme.",
