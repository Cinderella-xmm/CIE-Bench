    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's limbs appear evenly proportioned and consistent with typical human anatomy. The zig-zag motion lines surrounding the raised right arm are stylized elements often used in illustrations to depict motion or emphasis without affecting the physical anatomy itself. The joints, especially the elbows and knees, align with natural bending points without any visible distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a stylized design with celestial motifs like stars and planets integrated into the spacesuit. The texture and shading are consistent enough to blend into the suit and adhere to its illustrated style. There are no visible seams or artifacts that disrupt the uniformity of motif distribution, contributing to a coherent design that complements the suit's material appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the moon is depicted with craters and appears to be appropriately aligned with the astronaut's feet, providing correct depth and scale. There are no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and the moon surface, maintaining visual coherence in terms of perspective and physical layout relative to the shadow cast.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
    "explanation": "Excluding any portions affected by blurring, the illustration maintains a stylized representation of a human face. The proportions in terms of feature placement, such as eyes and jawline, are in line with typical facial anatomy. There is balance and definition observed within the confines of the illustration. Any inherent smoothing aligns with the stylized theme of Image B, without excessive distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes a space-themed border that frames the illustration neatly without encroaching upon the astronaut or moon background. There is consistent alignment around the edges. The simulated card stock texture maintains uniformity across the border, rendering the effect without visible repetition or inconsistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
