    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the vibrant striped and polka dot patterns on the 3D chibi-style ties appear undistorted and maintain their original integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the striped tie has distinct and clear stripes, and the polka dot tie shows evenly spaced dots, indicating that the patterns are undistorted and maintain the intended design. This suggests the original pattern integrity is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style ties seamlessly integrated into the realistic drawer setting without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties appear to be smoothly placed within the drawer without visible artifacts or clashing textures. The ties and the drawer look like part of the same environment due to consistent lighting and seamless blending, which enhances visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties retain proper proportions and physical rationality, ensuring no geometric shapes are broken or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shapes of the ties are consistent and appear logically proportioned relative to each other and to the drawer. There are no signs of distortion or unrealistic squashing, indicating correct geometric shapes and proportionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties exhibit consistent material properties, such as texture and sheen, similar to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties possess a cartoonish appearance which is different from the more realistic textile look in Image A. The material properties in Image B suggest a synthetic, polished look more typical of 3D art than fabric, differing from their original cloth-like texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the 3D chibi-style ties within the drawer setting adhere to common sense and physical logic, ensuring visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are placed upright within the drawer in a manner that appears stable and balanced, respecting common physical logic. This arrangement seems reasonable for displaying ties, aligning with common display practices.",
