      "question": "Does the tallest tower on the left retain its original vertical structure and proportional height after being modified with robotic limb features, without any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower on the left retains its original vertical structure and proportional height, but it features new modifications with robotic limb characteristics. However, these modifications do not result in any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges. The original shape of the tower is maintained with the added robotic features seamlessly integrated. The tower looks intact and consistent with the original form, only with added artistic elements for a futuristic look.",

      "question": "Are the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers smoothly integrated into the facade without visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers appear smoothly integrated into the facade. The lines of the circuitry are coherent and continuous, showing no visible breaks or unevenness. The patterns are applied uniformly, and their color gradients seem natural and consistent with a futuristic design theme, implying high-quality rendering and attention to detail in the editing process.",

      "question": "Do the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior, with no repeating patterns or distorted shapes suggesting low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scale-like panels on the dark glass towers in Image B show a uniform texture and reflection behavior. There are no evident repeating patterns or distorted shapes, indicating that the editing maintains high fidelity and rendering quality. The panels look realistically integrated, maintaining the consistent look expected of high-resolution imagery.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing expressway spines maintain a realistic width and curvature throughout their length. They connect logically to surrounding roads, suggesting a plausible structural integration into the cityscape. There are no visible floating or disconnected segments, which implies careful attention to detail in the editing process, achieving a cohesive and realistic addition to the scene.",

      "question": "Are the fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately, without appearing detached or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings in Image B are properly aligned with the rooflines and appear to be scaled appropriately. They do not look detached or structurally unstable, which indicates that the edit was done with precision to ensure that these new features integrate seamlessly into the original architecture, maintaining the illusion of stability and realism.",

      "question": "Are the holographic eye-like elements located on top of major towers clearly defined with smooth light emission and no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic eye-like elements on top of major towers in Image B are clearly defined, with smooth light emission. There are no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images, suggesting that the rendering was done at a high quality. The holographic features are sharp and exhibit a consistent glow, reinforcing the futuristic theme without compromising on image clarity.",

      "question": "Are all illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details (e.g., on the EMAAR building and VOCO tower) sharp and legible, with no visible blurring or degradation from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details, particularly on the EMAAR building and VOCO tower, are sharp and legible. There are no signs of blurring or degradation from the editing process, indicating that the elements have been carefully retained or enhanced during editing. This ensures that the edited image maintains high sharpness and clarity across all details.",
