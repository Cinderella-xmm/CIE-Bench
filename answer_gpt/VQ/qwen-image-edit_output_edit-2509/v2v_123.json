      "question": "Are the edges of the chibi-style 3D models seamlessly integrated with the photorealistic background without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D models have smoother and softer lines typical of this artistic style. However, they are displayed against a realistic background, creating a contrast between the style of the characters and the environment. While the integration is visually appealing, the difference in realism might result in visible artifacts or an unnatural blend, indicating they are placed over a background rather than being part of it.",

      "question": "Does the glowing armor on the blonde-haired character exhibit natural light effects and detailed runes without unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor is designed to have glowing runes that emit light. The chibi-style emphasizes exaggerated features but can sometimes miss finer detail. The light effects on the armor runes are uniformly bright with limited variance, which might cause them to look less realistic or natural compared to how light sources typically behave in photorealistic renditions.",

      "question": "Does the plain adventurer's clothing on the character holding the orb fit naturally on the chibi-style 3D model without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the plain adventurer's clothing appears to fit well on the chibi-style 3D model, with no visible distortion or unnatural stretching noted due to the simplistic and form-fitting design characteristic of chibi models, which generally accommodate such fittings without issue.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the leather armor and floral crown on the archer appear authentic and structurally consistent with the chibi-style 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi model wearing leather armor and a floral crown, features typical in fantasy settings. The simplified forms in chibi style might lack intricate detailing but still manage to maintain a structurally consistent appearance, with clear lines and a simplified representation fitting well on the model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the decorative border enhance the visual plausibility of the scene without disrupting its structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative border in Image B adds an artistic frame to the chibi-style illustration, serving to separate the scene visually and give it a finished look. While it is artistically pleasant and complements the style, depending on placement and style, it might disrupt the perception of coherence by differentiating between the scene's integrity and its artistic presentation.",
