      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is designed to capture the essence of the original character in a stylized manner. The hair is represented with simple shapes rather than detailed textures found in photographs, and the glasses are depicted as large, round circles. While these features are simplified, they still reflect key attributes (such as the presence of round glasses) that are associated with the original character. Therefore, the chibi version maintains visual consistency in terms of recognizable features, despite the simplification.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi version uses a consistent illustrative style where the textures are minimal and the focus is on bold outlines and simple color blocks. The scarf and wand follow this style, being depicted with flat colors and straightforward shapes, which aligns with the representation of other elements in the chibi figure such as the robe and glasses. As the style aims for a cartoonish simplification, these elements do match the rest of the figure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In chibi art style, proportions are often exaggerated for stylistic effect, such as large heads and small bodies. The hand holding the wand is simplified and smaller than what would be anatomically correct for a realistic human figure, but it is proportionate to the chibi's body and style. Chibi characters have distinct ratios that prioritize cuteness over realism, which this character adheres to, making it stylistically plausible.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character appears to be a sticker or keychain placed on a flat wooden surface, with a shadow visible that suggests a small height from the surface. The integration is smooth and without visible artifacts that would indicate poor editing. The shadow aligns with the character's outline, adding a realistic touch to how the character interacts with the background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf and tie are illustrated with simple and coherent geometric shapes, maintaining smooth lines and consistent patterns. The elements are intact and align with the chibi aesthetic of simplicity and cuteness. The stylistic choice avoids distortion and stays true to the design principles of chibi characters.",
