      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and grin added to the energy blast positioned within the glowing orb and aligned with its curvature, without creating jagged edges or broken light paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy blast has been modified with the addition of eyes and a grin. Analyzing their placement, these features are integrated within the orb and naturally follow its curvature. This positioning ensures that the original circular glow is not disrupted by any harsh or misaligned elements, maintaining a smooth visual flow with no broken paths or jagged edges. The energy and blast effects remain seamless, indicating a high level of integration.",

      "question": "Is the dialogue bubble positioned so that it does not overlap with Naruto’s face or hand, and does it have clean borders and readable text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the dialogue bubble is positioned away from Naruto's face and hand, ensuring it does not obstruct key elements of the character. The text inside the bubble is clear and well-spaced, with clean borders ensuring readability. This careful placement enhances the image's composition by maintaining focus on the characters and action.",

      "question": "Do the motion lines and energy beams from the spirit and Naruto’s attack converge smoothly at the fusion point, showing continuous flow without abrupt breaks or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features dynamic motion lines and energy beams that are crafted to converge smoothly at the fusion point. This convergence is handled with precision, as the energy flows are continuous and do not display abrupt disruptions or misalignments, suggesting a coherent and intentional design that successfully captures the intended action sequence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the debris and elemental fragments exhibit consistent lighting and shadow properties. These elements appear to float naturally in the scene, contributing to a sense of depth and a 3D environment. The shadows and lighting effects ensure they do not look pasted and instead are consistent with the image's overall lighting dynamics.",

      "question": "Does Naruto’s face retain the original number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband position, with no distorted lines or missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Naruto's facial features, including the whisker marks, eye shape, and headband remain unchanged. The characteristics retain their original count and appearance from the original image. The lines are intact and free from distortion, ensuring that no essential features are missing, and the integrity of his appearance is maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the action bubble placed in a visible area of the image without covering Naruto’s hand or the fusion point, and does it use consistent styling with the dialogue bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the action bubble is strategically placed to avoid obscuring Naruto's hand or the critical fusion point, ensuring visibility of essential action elements. The styling of the action bubble remains consistent with the dialogue bubbles, maintaining uniformity in design throughout the edited image.",
