      "question": "Do the iridescent scales cover the cardinal’s body smoothly without visible seams, pixelation, or inconsistent color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a vibrant mythical bird with blazing characteristics is featured, which suggests the presence of iridescent scales based on its majestic appearance. However, the image focuses on fiery elements and intricate feather details rather than scales that typically provide texture and subtle color transitions. The cardinal in the original Image A does not show these characteristics but instead features a smooth plumage. Since the question mentions iridescent scales and the edited bird does not have visible pixelation or awkward color transitions, it likely covers its surface smoothly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flames emerging from the wingtips and tail oriented upward and shaped naturally, without abrupt edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flames surrounding the wings and tail of the phoenix appear fluid and natural, showing dynamic shapes that mimic real flames and are oriented upwards, consistent with fire behavior. The flames connect seamlessly with the feathery parts of the creature, without apparent abrupt interruptions or isolated fragments, emphasizing a fiery, supernatural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glowing ember effect confined to the eye area, with no halo bleed onto the surrounding feathers or face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eye region of the phoenix is accentuated with a luminescent, ember-like effect which enhances its mythical appearance. Direct observation shows that this glow is intensely concentrated around the eyes themselves, with deliberate design intention to avoid halos spilling over onto adjacent feather regions on the face, ensuring that the glow remains localized and defined.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the obsidian branch retain the original branch’s branching pattern and thickness, with a smooth, glassy surface free of cracks or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch in Image B, while altered to an 'obsidian' aesthetic to match the fiery theme of the phoenix, retains the core branching pattern and thickness visible in Image A. The texture is adapted to appear smooth and glossy, akin to volcanic glass, maintaining it free of visible inconsistencies or cracks, which signifies the successful transformation of the original branch while keeping its foundational structure intact.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the flames on the blossoms directly connected to the petals, with no detached or floating flame elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows blossoms on the obsidian branch bursting with flames, closely integrated with each petal. The flames appear to naturally stem from the petals themselves, displaying no detached or floating fragments, which conveys a harmonious design where the flames and flowers coexist seamlessly, imbuing the image with a cohesive fiery theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the snowflakes falling around the flaming elements evenly distributed, with no unnatural absence or clustering near the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, as in Image A, snowflakes continue to fall throughout the scene. Despite the presence of fiery elements potentially affecting their distribution, the visual assessment indicates that the snowflakes remain evenly dispersed across the entire image, without evident gaps or clusters specifically around the flames. This implies an ambient snowfall pattern seemingly unaffected by the heat emanating from the phoenix and the branch.",
