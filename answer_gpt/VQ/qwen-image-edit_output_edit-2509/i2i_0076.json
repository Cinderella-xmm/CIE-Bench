      "question": "Does the word \"warm\" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'warm' is added in the top left corner over a plain background. Textured elements like a painting are not situated in that area. It's important for text overlays to not interfere with the surrounding environment's natural look. The word 'warm' shows no noticeable irregularities or artificial patterns, suggesting it integrates smoothly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the addition of the word \"warm\" at the top left corner maintained the structural consistency of surrounding elements like the sofa and cushions, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the word 'warm' is positioned distinctly away from furniture elements like the sofa and cushions, which are lower in the frame. This placement doesn't interfere with or distort these elements, maintaining their structural consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the size and font of the word \"warm\" maintain visual plausibility and authentic integration with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the context of Image B, the word 'warm' is sized appropriately for the space and clearly legible, which aligns well with typical practices for overlaying text on images. The font complements the setting's minimalist style, allowing it to integrate convincingly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner added in a manner that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Focusing on Image B, the word 'freedom' is positioned over a relatively featureless area, staying clear of detailed elements like the floor and plant. Thus, the addition doesn't occlude or otherwise interfere with these finer details, avoiding any unwanted artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner respect the structural integrity of nearby elements, such as the corner of the rug and plant pot base, without causing any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows 'freedom' placed near the bottom right, not overlapping the rug or pot base, which might cause distortion. Its positioning does not intrude on these elements, allowing them to retain their original structural shapes and integrity.",
