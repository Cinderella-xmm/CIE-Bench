    "Question": "Q1: Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral façade appears to be a miniature replica, possibly made from a resin material commonly used for models. This material often results in a smooth and plastic-like finish, lacking the fine detail and texture of natural stone. Despite attempts to mimic the intricate details of stonework, the uniformity and sheen typical of resin are evident, giving it a less textured appearance compared to real stone.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figures are carefully crafted to complement the scale of the cathedral, showcasing typical miniature perspectives where figures appear much smaller relative to the architecture. They seem to fit naturally in the scene, standing in front of the cathedral and interacting with their environment without appearing distorted or incorrectly positioned, maintaining proportionality in this scaled-down setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
    "explanation": "The miniature lamps in Image B are designed to emit light that is consistent with their size, creating a warm ambiance. The lighting effect is well-contained and doesn't overpower the scene, highlighting areas around the lamps softly and maintaining shadows where appropriate. This controlled lighting enhances realism despite the model setting, ensuring the light appears natural and proportional to the scaled environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the display case fully integrated around the cathedral and square with clean, continuous edges and no intersecting or fragmented parts that disrupt the geometry of the original structures?",
    "explanation": "The display case in Image B neatly encases the miniature model, with clean, polished edges. It appears to be well-crafted to house the cathedral and the surrounding miniature elements seamlessly. There is no visible fragmentation or intersecting lines that would disrupt the clean presentation, indicating a well-designed and integrated display setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the engraved plaque clearly visible, properly aligned, and styled with appropriate depth and lettering that matches the baroque aesthetic without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved plaque is prominently placed below the model. The engraving seems well-aligned and the lettering has a depth and style that harmonizes with the baroque architecture of the cathedral. It doesn't appear flat nor digitally superimposed, contributing to the overall authenticity and aesthetic of the display, aligning with traditional features one would expect from such a setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
