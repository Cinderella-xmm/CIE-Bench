      "question": "Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balconies and other appendage-like features appear as parts of a mechanical construct, resembling arms. The proportions are consistent and the joints where these appendages meet the main structure of the robot are smooth, with no visible jagged edges or unnatural bends. This suggests a well-designed transformation from typical balcony structures to mechanical appendages.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing panels are not placed in a pattern that corresponds to typical window positioning seen in building structures. Instead, they are positioned on a futuristic robot-like construct. The glow appears to be well-integrated into the structure, emitting light smoothly and blending with the surrounding surfaces without creating harsh halos or becoming pixelated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circuit patterns run along the edges and structural lines of the robot, such as limbs and torso. They maintain consistent thickness and color, appearing as intentional design features rather than random overlays or digital artifacts. This adds a sense of coherence and purpose to the overall design of the robot.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot structure features dynamic parts that look like arms and mechanical appendages. These are connected to the main structure through visible mechanical joints, suggesting realistic pivot points. There are no components that appear to be floating or misaligned, indicating a thoughtful integration of parts into the mechanical design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the buildingâ€™s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design includes exposed gears integrated into a mechanical, robot-like structure. The gears are placed at structural junctions, such as joints, and are scaled appropriately to the size of the robot. They do not appear oversized or misaligned, but rather they fit naturally into the overall mechanical aesthetic of the image.",
