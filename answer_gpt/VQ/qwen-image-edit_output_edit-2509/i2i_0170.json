      "question": "Are the clothing and bags of both women depicted with soft gradient blocks that retain their original shapes and proportions without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and bags of the women are analyzed based on their visual presentation. The outfits retain their original shapes and proportions accurately as seen in the clean lines and consistent texture quality. The soft gradient blocks used for style conversion do not result in any visible distortion or unnatural artifacts. The bags are similarly presented without introducing any unrealistic elements, supporting their natural appearance.",

      "question": "Do the mannequins and their outfits inside the store window appear structurally coherent and visually plausible in terms of shape and material after the style conversion, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mannequins and their outfits in Image B are evaluated by observing their structural coherence and texture. The mannequins retain their humanoid proportions effectively. The materials of the clothing appear realistic and maintain continuity with the visual context of the store display. There are no distortions in their shape or unnatural textures introduced by the style conversion, making them visually plausible.",

      "question": "Does the storefront maintain its original architectural details, such as the frame and tiles, without any visible distortion or introduction of non-natural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The storefront in Image B is examined for architectural consistency. The structural elements like the frame and tiles are accurately represented, preserving their original design. The style conversion does not introduce any distortion or non-natural textures that would otherwise alter these details, maintaining a coherent architectural appearance.",

      "question": "Is the texture of the cobblestone pavement represented naturally with soft gradients, maintaining the structural integrity and visual coherence without any loss of detail or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestone pavement in Image B is analyzed by looking at its textural quality and detailing. The soft gradients applied do not detract from the detailed texture of cobblestones nor distort their original structures. The visual portrayal retains the natural detailing and coherency expected of a paved surface, without any unnatural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects and shadows in the image convincingly portrayed with soft gradient blocks, ensuring they contribute to the overall realism and natural appearance without breaking the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting effects and shadows in Image B are scrutinized for realism and integration with the scene. These elements are rendered using soft gradient blocks that convincingly mimic natural light play, maintaining a cohesive visual flow. The light and shadow seamlessly blend with the image content, contributing to the overall realism without causing any breaks or discrepancies.",
