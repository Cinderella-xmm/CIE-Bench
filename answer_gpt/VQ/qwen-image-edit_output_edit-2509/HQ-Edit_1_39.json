      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the patterned scales on the cactus body consistent in texture and color with the embroidery of the sombrero, and do they follow the natural curvature of the cactus without visible seams or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus features a series of patterned scales which have intricate designs similar to embroidery, often seen in fabric art, akin to the sombrero's decorations. They appear uniform and follow the curvature of the cactus smoothly without seams or distortions, indicating a consistent design approach. The sombrero's vibrant patterns share the theme but contrast in texture, focusing more on embroidered textile-like visuals.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the stone-like base beneath the cactus have a natural rock texture, proper grounding on the wooden surface, and proportional size relative to the cactus, without appearing detached or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a stone-like base at the bottom, beneath the cactus, resembling natural rock formations both in texture and color. The grounding appears firm and properly integrated with the wooden surface it rests upon. The stone baseâ€™s size seems justifiably proportional to the cactus's overall size, enhancing the natural appearance without detachment or artificial shaping.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the golden quills emerge naturally from the cactus ridges in a uniform, radial pattern, maintaining the original spine density and orientation without clumping, floating, or intersecting improperly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden quills in Image B are shown in a radial pattern emerging naturally from the cactus ridges. They maintain a consistent density and orientation, replicating the typical arrangement observed in cacti species. They don't exhibit clumping, floating, or improper intersection, showing a thoughtful integration into the cactus's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sandy aura smoothly integrated around the base of the cactus and stone feet, exhibiting soft gradients and particle flow consistent with wind dynamics, without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandy aura in Image B envelops the cactus and its stone feet with a gentle gradient effect. It demonstrates a flowing particle effect, harmonizing with natural wind dynamics, creating soft transitions and blending with the surroundings. There are no indications of sharp boundaries or pixelation, ensuring a smooth visual consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the topaz-colored eyes placed symmetrically and naturally on the upper portion of the cactus, with clear reflections and highlights that match the ambient lighting, without distorting surrounding spines or surface geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are symmetrically placed on the upper portion of the cactus, featuring a topaz color that gives clarity and vibrancy. They reflect light consistently with the scene's ambient conditions without distorting adjacent spines or altering the cactus's surface geometry.",
