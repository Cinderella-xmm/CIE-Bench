    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin is transformed into a crystalline structure. The visual cues indicate that the crystal facets follow the original geometric outlines of the cabin, such as triangles on the roof and rectangles on the walls, preserving the original architectural shapes. This is consistent with world knowledge that crystal can be cut and molded to specific shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hues on the crystal surfaces exhibit variations in transparency and light reflection. The bright spots and darker undertones suggest different angles of light and refraction, indicative of glass or crystal properties where light behaviors are diverse. This is observable in natural light reflection and does not appear as a uniform solid color.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
    "explanation": "The crystal transformation in Image B maintains the structural integrity of the original cabin, as the vertical beams and horizontal railings align with the same positions and dimensions seen in Image A. The proportions and placements are visually consistent, indicating alignment with the cabin’s original framework.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the white marble platform appears smooth, flat, and continuous without visible cracks or irregularities. It has a glossy appearance that suggests an even, unmarred surface that extends evenly across the base of the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
    "explanation": "The small crystal formations in Image B are indeed proportionally smaller than the main structure. They are clustered in specific areas, particularly along the base of the cabin, resembling a natural crystallization pattern rather than being scattered randomly, suggesting intentional design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
