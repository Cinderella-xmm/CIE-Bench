    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the face is blurred, we can analyze the placement and structure of other features like the whiskers. The whiskers are properly aligned and positioned, indicating that essential details related to positioning are maintained. Furthermore, the edges of the blur suggest a similar shape and position as would be expected from the original image, implying that the conversion maintains shape and detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze helmet in Image B appears to be well-fitted over the head with clear edges that follow the curvature of the skull without visible misalignments or gaps. The helmet transitions smoothly to the body, showing realistic integration into the sculpture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blur obscures the eye region, but since it aligns with the placement structure, the glasses likely follow the original positioning. While the detail of reflection can't be assessed due to the blur, the framing seems consistent with the expectations from the original image indicating a proper fit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze clothing in Image B retains the form and contours of the original garment. Engraved designs appear to be following the natural fall of the material, matching the positioning of the garment's lines shown in Image A. This indicates successful preservation of the form and placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble base in Image B is shown directly beneath the sculpture, supporting it without visible gaps. Its size relative to the sculpture appears proportionate to ensure stability. The base aligns well, highlighting the precision in the rendered placement of the sculpture on the base.",
