    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object in question is a large cylindrical container rather than a teapot. It maintains a smooth, consistent cylindrical shape without any visible distortions. The cylinder walls appear continuous and uniform without irregularities, suggesting proper geometric form. In analyzing this shape, common knowledge of cylindrical objects supports the conclusion that the container fits the criteria of smooth surfaces and geometric regularity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the golden foil floral patterns clearly embossed with consistent depth, proper lighting interaction, and no signs of blurred edges or artificial textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the red container have a golden appearance and simulate a foil effect. The patterns are well-defined and interact properly with the lighting to give a clear and consistent embossed look. The edges of the patterns are sharp, and there are no signs of blurring or artificial textures, indicating a high-quality design with consistent depth.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the redesigned cups stacked in a stable, physically plausible manner with matching rim sizes and lids that fit securely without gaps or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are stacked with matching rim sizes and appear stable. The lids fit securely on the cups without visible gaps or misalignment, suggesting a design that considers physical stability and practicality. The visual cues of matching sizes and aligned fit are consistent with common world knowledge of stacking containers.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the Japanese calligraphy positioned at the top of the packaging with natural brushstroke variation and clear legibility, without clipping or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The Japanese calligraphy on the container in Image B is positioned near the top and displays variation in brushstroke width and style, typical of handcrafted calligraphy. It is clearly legible without signs of clipping or distortion, reflecting careful design to maintain natural variation and readability.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bamboo motif features consistent node spacing and grain texture, each segment having smooth and well-defined edges. The motif reduces any signs of repetition or distortion, ensuring the bamboo elements are easy to differentiate and aesthetically pleasing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
    "explanation": "The surface beneath the tea set in Image B is uniformly white with a consistently flat appearance. There are no visible shadows, textures, or reflections, fitting the criteria of having a simple and unobtrusive background design typical of product photography scenarios.",
    "answer": "Yes"
