    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the wood grain on the pug's body appear continuous and natural, with no repeating patterns or unnatural stretching, especially along the spine and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the pug sculpture has a uniform wood grain that appears continuous and natural. The grain follows the natural contours of the pug’s body, rather than being abruptly interrupted or stretched, which is typical of handmade carved wood sculptures. The absence of repeated patterns or stretches along the spine and limbs suggests that the grain was deliberately crafted to mimic the natural appearance of wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and creases on the pug’s face rendered as smooth, shallow grooves consistent with carved wood, without sharp, broken, or overly deep lines that disrupt the natural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial wrinkles and creases on the pug in Image B are crafted with shallow and smooth grooves, emblematic of a wooden material. These features present a flowing and continuous appearance without jagged, sharp, or overly deep lines, which aligns with the characteristics of a carved wooden object designed to maintain a natural look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pug’s limbs, head, and torso retain their original proportions and anatomical alignment, with no visible elongation, compression, or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the pug’s limbs, head, and torso are well-balanced and maintain the characteristically compact and stout appearance of a pug. There is no visible elongation or compression that would otherwise indicate a deviation from typical anatomical alignment or suggest misshapen joints, which is crucial for a realistic sculpture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the transitions between different parts of the wooden pug (e.g., head to neck, ear to head) seamless, with no visible cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the transitions between the pug’s head, neck, and ears are seamless. The uniform color and texture indicate a continuous carving where no cracks, ghosting, or abrupt color differences are visible, ensuring a cohesive representation of the sculpture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black base beneath the pug flat, uniformly dark, and fully supporting the pug’s feet without any gaps, shadows suggesting suspension, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black base supporting the pug in Image B is flat and uniformly dark. It is appropriately sized to support the pug’s feet with no apparent gaps or misalignment issues. This ensures that the sculpture appears stable with the pug's feet resting fully on the base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the highlights and shadows on the wooden pug match the ambient lighting of the scene, with reflections and depth appropriate for polished wood rather than fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The highlights and shadows on the pug in Image B are consistent with the properties of polished wood. The scene’s ambient lighting results in gentle reflections that highlight the wood grain and contours without making the surface appear like fur. This effect enhances the three-dimensional depth typical of a well-polished wooden sculpture.",
