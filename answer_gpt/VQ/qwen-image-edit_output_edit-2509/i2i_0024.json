      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure maintain the correct body proportions without any unnatural stretching or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is designed to reflect exaggerated features typical of chibi art, such as a larger head and smaller body. This style is characterized by its disproportionate yet consistent art style, which doesn't introduce any unexpected or unnatural distortions beyond the typical chibi exaggerations. The proportions are aligned with common chibi designs, maintaining consistency without any noticeable stretching or distortion.",

      "question": "Is the simplified racket with black lines and a filled shape free from unnatural textures and seamlessly integrated with the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The simplified racket in Image B uses bold black lines and a filled shape to create a stylized version that matches the chibi aesthetic. The texture remains consistent throughout, with no visible artifacts or irregularities, and its integration with the chibi figure is seamless, maintaining the stylistic coherence expected in such artwork.",

      "question": "Does the tennis ball sticker appear natural and free from any visible artifacts, with proper shading and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis ball sticker in Image B has a clear and consistent texture with smooth shading. It displays the typical bright green color expected of a tennis ball, with visible lines indicating its seam. The shading and texture are uncomplicated but appropriate for a simplistic chibi-style design, without any visible artifacts that would detract from its appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The V-sign hand sticker in Image B correctly features two extended fingers, forming a recognizable V shape. The fingers are drawn in a natural curve commonly seen in similar illustration styles, maintaining proportions and shapes consistent with the chibi theme, and avoiding any distortions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain red clay court lines stickers, as it only includes the chibi figure and accessories like the racket, tennis ball, and V-sign hand. Therefore, the question does not apply to the edited image.",
