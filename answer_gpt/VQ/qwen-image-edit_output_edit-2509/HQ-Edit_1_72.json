    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold embellishments are integrated into the Dashiki, and visually, they appear to be part of the fabric itself without indications of being overlayed or separate. The reflective properties appear consistent, with light interacting with the gold parts, enhancing realism without any signs of floating or pixelation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beads and symbols on the shoulders in Image B align with the anatomical curvature of the shoulders. The textures of these elements appear coherent with the material of the Dashiki, maintaining symmetry and placing correctly without appearing distorted or misaligned.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Acacia trees display natural branching patterns, characteristic of their species, and their proportion seems realistic without visible geometric distortions. Their placement in the scene maintains a consistent and coherent visual balance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wild grass shown in Image B portrays a realistic array of variations in height, color, and orientation. There is evident attention to detail in ensuring the grass does not repeat in any pattern or appear tiled, giving a natural and varied appearance consistent with real landscapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each, with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shading that matches the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands visually depict five fingers each, with anatomical correctness in finger alignment and joint positions. The skin texture and shading are consistently matched with the figure's overall appearance, maintaining a natural look without anomalies.",
