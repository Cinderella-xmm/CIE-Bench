      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features and limbs added to the cookies in Image B are smooth and proportionally consistent with the size of the cookies.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plate has been transformed into a fabric with a floral pattern that covers its surface. The pattern is continuous and evenly distributed across the fabric.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature chairs and tea table are positioned around the cup and the cookie characters.

      "question": "Do the facial expressions on the cookies (grinning, pouting, winking) show clear differentiation in mouth and eye shapes while maintaining symmetry and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial expressions on the cookies in Image B show clear differentiation. The grinning expression features an open mouth and wide eyes, while the pouting has a smaller mouth shape. The winking expression includes an asymmetrical eye shape. These variations maintain symmetry with natural curvature, adding character to each cookie.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table are arranged to suggest stable contact with surfaces. Each object appears grounded without any floating elements, maintaining realistic depth in the scene's composition. The arrangement supports a believable interaction between objects and surfaces.",
