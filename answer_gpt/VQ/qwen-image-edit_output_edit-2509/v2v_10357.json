      "question": "Are the shapes of the teddy bear and motorcycle still recognizable after being converted to a low-poly 3-D render style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains clear and familiar shapes for both the teddy bear and the motorcycle. Despite the suggestion of a low-poly 3-D style, the structures are well-defined without compromise to their fundamental design. The bear's form and the intricate detailing of the motorcycle are visually similar to versions depicted in standard non-rendered photography.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the textures of the teddy bear show a plush and fuzzy surface, typical of a teddy bear material, and the motorcycle maintains its metallic sheen and detailed components like the engine and tires. These details suggest a high level of texture retention, rather than a simplification often found in low-poly renders.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the teddy bear and motorcycle in the edited image look realistic and proportional to real-life representations. The scale between the two appears balanced, with the teddy bear seated properly on the motorcycle as a person might, maintaining realistic proportions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts the teddy bear in a natural riding posture, with its arms positioned on the handlebars and legs in line with the motorcycle structure. This interaction is consistent with how a rider would sit, conveying a believable integration of the teddy bear with the motorcycle.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image aligns well with the foreground objects. Both the teddy bear and motorcycle maintain clarity and definition, indicating that they have not been converted to a low-poly render. There are no visible artifacts or mismatches, suggesting a coherent composition in which the background is seamlessly integrated with the foreground elements.",
