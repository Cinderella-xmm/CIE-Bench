      "question": "Are the brick textures and shapes of the building and the \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign consistent with Lego bricks, without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's brick texture and 'LAUNDROMAT' sign show characteristics typical of Lego construction. The bricks exhibit the uniformity and blocky nature of Lego pieces, characterized by sharp edges and consistent shapes, which indicate a deliberate design choice congruent with Lego aesthetics. Such a construction typically avoids unnecessary artifacts and maintains clear geometric shapes, reflecting the precision of Lego bricks. The right-angled, standardized blocks and the sign appear distinctly in line with how a Lego environment would be constructed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the person holding the laundry appear naturally integrated into the Lego-style environment without any visible distortion or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person holding the laundry is depicted with the glossy, smooth surface typical of Lego figurines. The limbs, torso, and clothing have the distinctive shine and rounded geometry seen in Lego models. The figure fits seamlessly into the environment, sharing the same scale and consistent articulation expected of a Lego scene, without any distortion or blending issues. The lighting and shadows are evenly applied, mimicking the typical materials used in Lego to ensure a cohesive appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the washing machines and interior of the laundromat align with the structural and stylistic elements of Lego. They maintain geometric consistency, appearing blocky and pixelated as if constructed from stacked Lego pieces. The uniform textures and angles typical of Lego models ensure that these elements preserve their shape and function, avoiding any broken or deformed formations that would detract from the illusion of them being crafted from Lego bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of folded laundry appears distinctly in Lego form. The surfaces of the clothing items lack the detailed fabric texture found in natural textiles, instead showing a polished, planar texture indicative of Lego materials. This style contrasts with realistic cloth folds, as the Lego construction method simplifies these elements into block-like forms. Such simplification aligns with the visual theme mandated by a Lego-style representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the scene, including the person, the laundry, and the laundromat, coherent and visually plausible as a stop-motion diorama crafted in the style of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a composition where all elements - the person, the laundry, and the laundromat - adhere to the Lego aesthetic, creating a unified visual theme. The integration of these components mimics a stop-motion scene constructed entirely of Lego, where everything fits within the consistent scale and stylistic elements of a Lego diorama. The consistent lighting and congruent materials collectively enhance the plausibility of the scene, embodying a coherent and imaginative Lego representation.",
