      "question": "Do the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal appear to naturally integrate with the warm red and gold hues of the book and pitcher without disrupting the overall color harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a LEGO minifigure and a mythical creature inside a transparent glass cube against a gradient background. Both LEGO elements feature bright and vivid colors with warm tones. In contrast, the book and pitcher in Image A are depicted in rich, warm colors that harmonize with each other. Due to the thematic and stylistic differences, the LEGO elements do not blend seamlessly with the elegant color palette observed in the previous book and pitcher arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and sizes of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal logically consistent with the scale of the book and pitcher, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure and mythical creature are miniature figures contained within a glass cube, suggesting a toy-like scale appropriate for their type. In Image A, the book and pitcher are regular-sized objects with realistic proportions. The dissimilarity in scale between toys and everyday objects make it improbable for the LEGO elements to be consistent in size and scale with the book and pitcher from Image A.",

      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal maintain a natural and high-quality appearance, free from any unnatural artifacts or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts LEGO figures characterized by precise and consistent color application typical of plastic and mass-produced toys. The textures are smooth and representative of high-quality plastic, which is appropriate for LEGO elements. There are no unnatural artifacts or loss of detail visible, suggesting that the integrity of the materials and textures is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosing the scene preserve its structural integrity and visual plausibility, without introducing any broken geometric shapes or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube enclosing the LEGO scene in Image B appears to maintain clear geometric boundaries and appropriate reflections that are expected from a transparent object. There are no visible distortions or unrealistic reflections that compromise its structural integrity, ensuring a visually realistic depiction of a glass enclosure.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gradient background transition smoothly from deep amber to soft cream tones, enhancing the cozy ambiance without disrupting the visual authenticity and natural appearance of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gradient background smoothly transitions from deep amber to soft cream tones, which complements the warm colors of the LEGO figures and the glass cube without clashing. This transition is visually pleasing and adds to the cozy ambiance of the setting while maintaining the visual authenticity and natural appearance as an artistic backdrop.",
