    "Question": "Q1: Do the zebras maintain their signature striped coats with no unnatural texture or loss of detail in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are depicted with their characteristic striped coats that show no unnatural texture or loss of detail. The stripes appear clear, distinct, and consistent, resembling those in real-life zebras. Despite the frame, there is no application of a chibi-style 3D effect on the zebras themselves; they appear realistic and preserving the essence seen in real zebras. Thus, their coats are detailed and natural looking.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the zebras retain their realistic grazing stances without any distortion or deformation in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the ornate frame, the zebras maintain their realistic grazing stances similar to those observed in a natural setting. There is no evidence of distortion or deformation in their bodies or postures. Their legs and heads are positioned correctly as expected from grazing zebras, which supports the idea that they retain realism even in the framed image scenario.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the photorealistic background smooth and believable without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the zebras are not rendered in a chibi-style 3D but rather maintain their realistic appearance, seamlessly integrating with the photorealistic background. The coherence between the zebras and the environment is smooth, without evident artifacts or inconsistencies given the visual alignment and preservation of realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
