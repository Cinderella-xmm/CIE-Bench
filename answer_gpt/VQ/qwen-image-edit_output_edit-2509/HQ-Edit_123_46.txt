    "Question": "Q1: Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines are meant to enhance the comic style by providing definition to the shapes. Though they generally trace the main elements like the player, basketball, hoop, and court, there are minor instances where they overlap or cut into the forms slightly due to the intricate detailing required for dynamic comic designs. Such overlaps are part of stylistic comic imprecision rather than errors.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the player’s body or the basketball?",

These lines generally radiate outward from the subjects, avoiding intersections with solid objects like the player's body or the basketball, thus maintaining the clarity of motion without disrupting the central imagery.",
