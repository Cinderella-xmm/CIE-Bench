      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box containing the chibi cat figurine is shown with clear, straight edges and consistent angular proportions, indicative of proper isometric representation.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the chibi cat figurine have a shiny, glass-like appearance with smooth reflections. The highlights are uniform, without visible pixelation or irregularities, suggesting a high level of detail in the rendering process, characteristic of a well-crafted figurine design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fur texture of the chibi cat figurine in Image B maintains a stylized appearance consistent with the overall design theme, which contrasts with the realistic rendering of the cat in Image A. The chibi figure's fur does not exhibit the same level of detail and natural flow present in the realistic fur of the original cat, indicating a deliberate artistic choice to simplify details.",
