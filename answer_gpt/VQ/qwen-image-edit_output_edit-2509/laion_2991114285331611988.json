      "question": "Is the watch communicator on the plaid tie positioned naturally within the fabric, with consistent color, texture, and lighting that match the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch communicator appears to be superimposed on the plaid tie, drawing on common visual effects in cartoon illustrations. The depiction is consistent with the common stylistic choices seen in illustrations, where objects don't always blend photorealistically with their surroundings. The watch is distinct and somewhat detached in visual portrayal from the fabric of the tie in the cartoon style, which often deliberately contrasts elements for clarity and emphasis. This style usually highlights objects to stand out against the clothing or background for emphasis, indicating that in this cartoon representation, the communicator does not blend naturally into the fabric due to the expressive nature of the medium.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camera lens embedded in the emblem on the right suit’s lapel aligned with the pattern and fabric, showing no gaps, misaligned edges, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right suit’s lapel features an emblem with a camera lens that is clearly intended to be a conceptual and humorous twist as part of the comic’s theme. The camera lens on the lapel is part of the cartoon's exaggerated and stylistic choices, utilized for the comedic effect related to the 'spy' theme. In this style, alignment, gaps, or highlights may not adhere strictly to realistic guidelines as the artistic aim is often to emphasize features over precise detailing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles and dialogue text clearly separated from the characters’ faces and clothing, with clean lines and no overlap or distortion of nearby features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubbles and dialogue text are designed to be independent elements distinct from characters and clothing. The style in comics often features bold outlines and clear separation to ensure dialogue and thoughts are easily readable and distinguished from the surrounding visual elements. The separation is intentional to maintain focus on the communicative elements without interfering with character portrayals.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the characters’ necks and shoulders retain natural proportions and smooth contours, without stretched, compressed, or fragmented shapes after anthropomorphization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphization turns one of the character's heads into a camera in line with the comic's theme. This alteration follows a comic style that purposefully exaggerates or alters physical features for thematic or comedic effect rather than strict realism. While this results in a clearly altered, non-realistic form, within the context of cartoons, it maintains consistency by keeping the rest of the body's proportions and contours intact. Hence, the changes are stylistic rather than suggestive of error.",

      "question": "Is the grassy field and sky background free from distortion, noise, or color inconsistencies that suggest digital manipulation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the grassy field and sky is stylized following typical comic illustration techniques. These illustrations often use flat colors and uniform textures rather than detailed or hyper-realistic imagery. Given this intentional stylistic choice, no digital manipulation for error-correction is evident, as simplification and a clear, clean style are inherent features of the medium.",
