      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D characters retain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortions in their facial features and body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the people depicted inside the snow globe are styled as chibi 3D characters, recognized by their exaggerated proportions often found in chibi art, such as larger heads compared to body sizes. This is a stylistic choice, not an actual natural distortion, in chibi character designs. Therefore, within the context of the chibi art style, the proportions appear intentional and natural for this genre.",
