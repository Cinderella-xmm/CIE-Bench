    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the bioluminescent mushrooms in the mid-ground and foreground have smooth, continuous surfaces without pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mushrooms appear to have well-defined edges and a smoothly blended surface, suggesting quality rendering. Their bioluminescent properties are highlighted through consistent color and shading, indicating no pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the transformed tree trunks (left and right sides) geometrically coherent and smoothly integrated into the bark texture without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features on the tree trunks demonstrate coherent integration with the bark texture, maintaining the natural flow of the tree structure without visible seams or distortions. This indicates careful blending and realistic rendering techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the iridescent wings of the fairy creatures near the stream and on rocks show smooth color transitions and uniform transparency without pixelation or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fairy wings in Image B exhibit smooth transitions in iridescent colors and uniform transparency, which are critical in avoiding pixelation or unnatural banding. The wings blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, showcasing effective rendering of transparency effects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the silver mist flow naturally over the mossy rocks and around the streambed, maintaining consistent opacity and avoiding abrupt changes in density or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mist flows naturally over the scene with a consistent opacity that integrates well into the environment. It maintains a smooth texture without abrupt changes in density, contributing to the harmony of the landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (mushrooms and will-o'-wisps) emit soft light that casts subtle shadows and blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh highlights or disconnected glow zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing elements emit soft light that casts subtle shadows and blends effectively with the ambient illumination. This prevents harsh highlights and ensures there are no disconnected glow zones, resulting in a cohesive visual effect.",
      "weight": 1,
