      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown positioned on the chicken's head in a way that maintains proportional size and natural integration with the skin texture, without visible seams or unnatural lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown appears to be positioned on the chicken's head with proportional size, aligning well with the overall context of a crowned 'king' chicken. The lighting and shadow effects help blend the crown seamlessly with the chicken's body, and there is no noticeable seam or break in texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoonish eyes placed symmetrically on the chicken's head with smooth contours and no jagged edges or misaligned shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish eyes are not visible as the face region is blurred, preventing detailed assessment of symmetry, contour smoothness, and shadow alignment.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the throne structure beneath the chicken maintain consistent depth and alignment with the plateâ€™s surface, without floating or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the throne beneath the chicken appears to be well-integrated with the overall scene. The depth and alignment seem consistent with the plate's surface, and there are no apparent floating or overlap inconsistencies that would disrupt the cohesion of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the anthropomorphic features on the vegetables (such as eyes or limbs) seamlessly blended into their surfaces without visible pixelation, texture breaks, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vegetables exhibit anthropomorphic features like eyes and limbs that are smoothly integrated into their design. The shading is consistent, and there are no visible pixelation or texture breaks, indicating a seamless blend.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the candles, ornaments, and foliage are vivid yet balanced. The image retains details such as the tips of pine needles and the play of light on ornaments without any indication of oversaturation or haloing.",
