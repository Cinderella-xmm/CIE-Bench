      "question": "Are the clothing and hairstyle features of the players accurately represented in chibi form without artificial or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a chibi representation of tennis players, simplifying and stylizing certain features; however, the clothing and hairstyles are represented without any unnatural or distorted textures, following typical chibi art styles that include smooth finishes and cartoon-like designs. This form of illustration favors simplification over complex textures, which is intentional rather than a flaw.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the players' hands in the handshake pose appear natural and anatomically correct, with no missing or extra fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi players each have four fingers visible in a handshake pose, which is consistent with typical chibi style where anatomical proportions are modified for stylistic purposes to appear cute and cartoony. Despite this stylization, the handshake pose is accurately represented with no missing fingers.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the semi-transparent tennis court logo integrate smoothly into the background without creating distracting artifacts or distorting the tennis court?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a semi-transparent background featuring a tennis court logo. This logo is smoothly integrated, serving as a non-distracting, complementary backdrop that does not interfere with the clarity or proportions of the elements in the foreground. Such integration is common in digital art to provide context without overwhelming the main focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tennis rackets proportionally appropriate for the chibi characters and clearly identifiable as tennis rackets without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi illustration of Image B, the tennis rackets are stylized but still identifiable as tennis rackets, with proportionate size relative to the chibi figures. This stylization exaggerates certain features but does not distort their recognizability or function in the context of the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details like facial expressions and clothing patterns on the chibi characters been preserved without significant loss or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi characters in Image B exhibit facial expressions and clothing patterns consistent with the art style, maintaining clarity and detail appropriate to this illustration format. Such stylization inherently includes simplified features but does not equate to loss of necessary detail or subsequent smoothing that feels unnatural.",
