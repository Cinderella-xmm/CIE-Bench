      "question": "Does the transition area between the painting and the wall maintain the natural texture of the wall material without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the transition area between the painting and the wall appears smooth and seamless. There are no visible signs of artifacts or disturbances in the texture of the wall, which looks consistent and natural as typical for indoor residential settings. Based on common visual observations, the wall maintains a coherent consistency. When comparing Image B with Image A, both images exhibit a similar smooth transition between the wall and the frame, supporting the conclusion that the wall's texture is preserved in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the trees and water in the painting maintained realistically without appearing stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting displays trees and water with proportions that appear realistic and appropriate for such a scenic depiction. The trees exhibit natural shapes and sizes, and the water maintains typical characteristics of perspective and flow. Such portrayal is common in landscape paintings. Comparing this with Image A, there are no noticeable differences in the tree and water proportions. Both images preserve realistic proportions without signs of distortion.",

      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting in the painting align consistently with the room's light source, avoiding unnatural contrasts or disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painting's lighting and shadows complement the room's light source from the window. The warm tones in the painting match the natural sunlight entering the room, providing harmony between the painting and the setting. This kind of alignment is typical when considering interior decorative consistency. Image A shares a similar alignment, allowing the painting's colors and shadows to blend seamlessly with the space's lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the painting preserve its depth and layering, creating a believable 3D effect without disrupting its visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B effectively uses depth and layering to create a convincing perspective within the painting. The trees along the river exhibit proper depth, giving the illusion of a path leading toward the setting sun. These techniques are standard in creating spatial coherence in art. When analyzed alongside Image A, both versions maintain these visual effects without disrupting coherence, demonstrating careful artistic execution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the frame around the painting retain its structural integrity and material appearance without visible damage or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden frame around the painting appears intact and well-crafted, without indications of structural damage or unusual textures. This is consistent with the expectations of quality framing. Upon examining Image A, the frame also looks well-preserved, with consistent material quality across both images. Therefore, Image B continues to exhibit a preserved structural integrity.",
