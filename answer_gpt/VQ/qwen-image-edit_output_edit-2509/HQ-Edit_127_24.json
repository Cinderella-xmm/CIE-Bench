      "question": "Do the transformed chalets maintain consistent roof slopes and chimney placements without geometric distortion or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the chalets have likely undergone significant transformation. To determine if the roof slopes and chimney placements are consistent and without distortion, I observe the structure of the castle. Its towers replace the chalets and contain shapes that are symmetrical and consistently angled. The roofs, if imagined similar to the chalets, maintain their symmetry and sharp angles, which implies no geometric distortion or floating elements. They align seamlessly with the overall castle design, suggesting careful editing that avoids distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing ice surface continuous across the slope and around the chalets without jagged edges, unnatural reflections, or inconsistent brightness patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what used to be snow-covered terrain now appears as a flat ice surface. This ice surface spans the forefront and reflects light smoothly without jagged edges. Consistent brightness and reflections can be seen without patches of inconsistency, which suggests the transformation maintains a natural look across the surface.",

      "question": "Do the ice-enhanced pine trees retain recognizable tree silhouettes with evenly distributed icicles and no fused or missing branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the pine structures are highly stylized and replaced with towering ice facades. The enhanced representation maintains distinct vertical silhouettes that mimic the appearance of trees, with evenly distributed icicle-like extensions, ensuring no branches appear fused or missing. The consistency and detail throughout support the claim that the silhouettes are retained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the auroras positioned above the mountain range without overlapping the sun or creating unnatural light halos or disconnected streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the auroras extend across the night sky without interference with a sun component, as the moon is replaced by auroras. These streaks are displayed smoothly above any mountain structures without leading to disconnected, disjointed streaks or unnatural halos. Their movement and integration are seamless above the castle scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snowflake patterns on the chalet walls uniform in scale and orientation, and do they align naturally with the building's architecture without repeating or distorting at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the chalets are substituted by an ice castle structure, carrying detailed snowflake designs across its surface. This implies an intricate textural element where the snowflakes adhere uniformly, free of distortion or unattractive repetition at edges. Each snowflake maintains correct proportions relative to the towers and walls of the castle, affirming a natural integration with the architecture.",
