    "Question": "Q1: Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the hammer handle appears to be smoothly integrated. The color of the logo matches well with the natural wood tone of the handle, and there are no visible texture mismatches or jagged edges. The logo appears aligned with the grain and texture of the handle, suggesting a natural continuation rather than a pasted element. A comparison with Image A, if needed, would further confirm there is nothing unnatural about the edit by missing the logo.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the letters on the wood shavings appear to follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving accurately. They seem to wrap around the shavings with a consistent and natural alignment, showing no signs of being flattened or stretched. They do not appear to float above the surface but rather blend with the shavings as if engraved or written directly onto them. Based on this visual analysis, the integration looks seamless.",

    "explanation": "The rustic banner at the top of Image B aligns well with the overall lighting and shadowing of the scene. The texture of the banner looks like aged wood, with grainy details and natural tonal variations that one would expect from a wooden surface.

It doesn't appear disproportionate or oddly placed in the scene. A subtle shadow beneath the card matches the ambient light source, ensuring the card's integration into the scene looks realistic and believable.",
