      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of the 3D chibi-style bicycles consistent with their original forms, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycles are transformed into chibi-style, meaning they exhibit exaggerated features and simplified forms, typical of this art style. Chibi designs often use proportion distortion intentionally to create a stylized appearance. The shapes have been simplified, and proportions altered with larger wheels and rounded frames. Compared to Image A, which presents standard bicycles, the chibi-style in Image B demonstrates intentional modification rather than distortion in error.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the colors of the 3D chibi-style bicycles match their original counterparts without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each bicycle has been given a distinct solid color corresponding to its original version in Image A: red, yellow, and black. These colors are in line with the originals. Chibi designs typically lack detailed textures, opting for smooth surfaces. Thus, the colors match without unnatural textures, adhering to characteristic chibi stylization.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style bicycles arranged in the same relative positions and spacing as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While analyzing Image B, the bicycles are positioned in a similar triad arrangement with consistent spacing and alignment seen in Image A. The relative positions of how the bicycles are displayed — parallel and slightly angled — remain unchanged across both images.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the 3D chibi-style bicycles align naturally with the light source and the floor, contributing to the overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows from the bicycles are projected downward onto the reflective floor, consistent with the light source's position from the large window behind. This shadow alignment is similar to Image A, validating the natural interaction with the environment and maintaining realism in light projection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the wheels, frames, and other components of the 3D chibi-style bicycles retained their fine details without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style involves a significant simplification of features, minimizing intricate details for smooth and exaggerated forms. Image B shows simplified components like large rounded wheels and basic frames. While detailed complexity from Image A is reduced, the simplification does not indicate artifacts but rather stylization characteristic of chibi designs.",
