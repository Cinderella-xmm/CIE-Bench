      "question": "Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe are depicted with similar aesthetic qualities as in Image A. The scene captures a sunset beach, which is a familiar and plausible setting for a snow globe, but it's essential to consider the transformation from a real beach to a miniaturized version. The scene maintains consistency by using elements like a sunset, water, and a figure waxing a surfboard. However, the context of a snow globe and the transition into a smaller scale add an element of whimsical interpretation. Thus, while the representation embraces miniature styling, it does so without compromising visual credibility.",

      "question": "Are the hands of the chibi-style 3D surfer figure free of unnatural textures and maintain the correct number of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the chibi-style surfer figure are crafted to fit the stylized miniature look. They should still display usual human anatomical features, such as the presence of fingers. The chibi style often exaggerates certain features while maintaining essential characteristics. Based on the image, there is no indication of unnatural textures or an incorrect number of fingers, suggesting visually coherent hands within the chibi design.",

      "question": "Does the soft golden light and sparkles scattered around the snow globe create a natural and plausible warm atmosphere without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a snow globe scene that incorporates warm light reflecting a sunset theme. The golden light provides a warm atmosphere, resonating harmoniously with the sunset setting and enhancing the cozy indoor ambiance provided by the fireplace. Light within the snow globe and sparkles are executed without visible artifacts, instead enhancing the aesthetic and believability of the snow globe's enchanting aura.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the miniature surfer figure and surfboard remain intact and undistorted within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer figure and surfboard are presented inside a snow globe, indicating a small and curved surface. Despite this setting, the chibi-style surfboard and figure preserve the integrity of their shapes. The figure and surfboard are stylized but maintain realistic proportions relative to their designs, showing no distortion caused by the glass or miniaturization process.",

      "question": "Is the placement of the snow globe on the wooden shelf near the fireplace visually credible and proportionally realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is placed on a wooden surface near a lit fireplace. This setting is consistent with cozy indoor decorations. The proportional relationship between the snow globe and surrounding objects, like the fireplace, respects common perceptions of size and space for interior settings, as it does not seem oversized or undersized for a snow globe near a fireplace, ensuring a realistic portrayal.",
