      "question": "Does the golden scepter in the man's right hand have a smooth, reflective metallic surface that matches the lighting conditions without exhibiting unnatural texture artifacts or inconsistent highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden scepter displays a consistent, smooth appearance with reflective qualities typical of polished metal. The highlights on the scepter are consistent with a uniform light source, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or textures. This careful rendering suggests an understanding of how metallic surfaces interact with light, effectively capturing the intended look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pastel-colored fabrics of the man’s coat, vest, trousers, and shirt rendered with visible texture and depth, maintaining natural folds and shadows without appearing flat or washed out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel-colored fabrics of the man's attire exhibit a smooth and simple finish typical of cartoon or illustration styles, which generally don't prioritize detailed texture. Therefore, these fabrics appear without complex textural details or depth, being more flat in nature. This style is expected to lack the dimensional folds and shadows seen in realistic renderings.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cobblestones beneath the man’s feet form a continuous, evenly spaced pattern with natural irregularities and consistent shading, avoiding broken or misaligned stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestones are drawn with an evenly spaced pattern, typical of illustrated settings. Though simple, they maintain a consistent layout, typical of uniform stylistic choices made in illustrations and maintain a stylized consistency. However, the lack of variation and shading indicates a more flat, uniform design rather than realistic cobblestones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable note sections placed along the outer edges of the image without overlapping the man or background architecture, and do they have clean, uniform borders resembling paper cutouts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detachable notes are strategically positioned along the outer edges of the image. They do not overlap the main figure or background, aligning well with the overall composition. Their borders are clean, straight, and uniform, resembling paper cutouts, which is consistent with typical artistic presentations involving pinned or clipped notes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the man’s right hand gripping the scepter show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation, while the left hand in the pocket maintains a relaxed, anatomically accurate pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's right hand holding the scepter and left hand placed in the pocket are drawn with simplified and stylized forms, typical of cartoon illustrations. While the right hand suggests a grip on the scepter, the fingers are not detailed with natural joint angles. The left hand in the pocket has a basic, indicative form without detailed anatomical accuracy.",
