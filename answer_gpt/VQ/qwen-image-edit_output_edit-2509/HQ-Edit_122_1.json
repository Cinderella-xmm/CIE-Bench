      "question": "Do the petal-like wing structures appear translucent with smooth gradients and no jagged edges or unnatural pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the fairy-like figure appear highly detailed, resembling petals that have smooth color transitions and gradients. Translucence is evident as the background subtly shows through, indicating no pixelation or rough edges. Visual cues such as the gradient of colors and seamless integration with the background suggest a refined image quality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden tendrils smoothly attached to the head, with consistent metallic sheen and visible sparkle effects that do not distort the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden tendrils in Image B are firmly and aesthetically attached to the fairy creature's head. The shiny surface and metallic luster are consistent throughout, providing a smooth and bright appearance. The soft sparkle effects are integrated well, enhancing the visual appeal without causing distortion or altering the surrounding area integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the floral texture on the butterfly’s body follow the natural contours without warping or breaking the underlying shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a butterfly; instead, there is a fairy-like creature adorned with floral textures across its body. The floral textures align with the contours of the figure smoothly, maintaining the shape and integrity of the silhouette without noticeable warping or breaking of the form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sapphire orb eyes symmetrically positioned and emitting a soft glow without bleeding into the head or causing halo artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of the fairy in Image B are glowing sapphire orbs, symmetrically placed on the face. The luminescence is softly emitted, maintaining definition without bleeding into the surrounding head space and avoiding halo artifacts, thus showcasing balanced imaging for these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the starry trail aligned with the butterfly’s position and orientation, with gradual fading and no abrupt edges or floating particles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a starry trail follows the fairy-like figure, accompanying its position and orientation perfectly. The trail fades gradually as it stretches forth, avoiding abrupt interruptions or unrelated floating particles, which helps in creating an organic motion effect alongside the figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the floating blooms positioned at plausible distances from the ground and integrated with the lighting gradient without casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating blooms in Image B show varied positioning that appears natural, suspended in a plausible manner when considering the background depth. The integration with the lighting gradient supports this realistic placement, ensuring no conflicting shadow work, seamlessly blending with the scene's ambiance and room illumination.",
