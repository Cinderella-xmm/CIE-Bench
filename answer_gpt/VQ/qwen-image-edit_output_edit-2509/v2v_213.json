      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly retain their natural texture and pattern without any visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings display a blocky, pixelated texture indicative of a low-resolution 3D model or a voxel art style. This differs from the smooth and intricate natural patterns typically found on a real butterfly's wings, such as those seen in Image A. The blocky appearance is an unnatural artifact in terms of biological accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the butterfly's body and wings consistent with its natural form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shapes and proportions of the butterfly in Image B are consistent with its natural form, despite the stylization into a pixelated or voxel art format. The overall silhouette, including the wingspan and body shape, follows the typical proportions of a real butterfly, similar to the one in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shading on the butterfly in the 3D model appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to have been rendered to match the scene's lighting conditions as seen in Image A. Shadows and highlights are present on the butterfly model, suggesting an attempt to mimic natural lighting conditions. While the model's pixelated nature alters the appearance, the lighting itself remains coherent with the scene.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the patterns on the wings and the texture of the body, been preserved without any loss or distortion in the 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a vastly simplified pattern on the wings, characterized by larger, pixelated areas rather than the intricate design and texture seen in Image A. This indicates a loss of fine details, with the model sacrificing detailed patterns for a stylized representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and placement of the butterfly in the 3D model appear visually plausible and coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is positioned similarly to the butterfly in Image A, appropriately making contact with the table's edge. Despite the stylized format, the composition and placement within the scene are coherent, matching the angle and position effectively found in natural settings.",
