      "question": "Do the three figures retain anatomically correct body proportions and natural hand shapes (with no more than five fingers per hand) after being stylized as ink-painting poets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are rendered with stylized ink painting features typical of traditional Chinese art. The figures have flowing robes and realistic body proportions consistent with typical anatomy. There are no more than five fingers per hand, and the hand shapes are naturalistic, despite the stylization. Therefore, anatomically, the stylization respects the common proportions and natural hand shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the willow branches and lotus leaves rendered with smooth, flowing brushstrokes that preserve their natural form and do not exhibit jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the willow branches and lotus leaves in a traditional ink painting style, characterized by flowing, smooth brushstrokes. The artistic rendition preserves their natural forms, with no signs of jagged edges or texture artifacts, which is consistent with the aesthetics of ink brush paintings.",

      "question": "Does the mountain background feature soft, layered ink-wash gradients that blend naturally with the surrounding mist and sky without sharp transitions or artificial blur effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountains in Image B are depicted using soft, layered ink wash techniques that fade into the mist and sky, part of traditional Chinese landscape painting. This approach avoids sharp transitions or artificial blur effects, maintaining a natural blend that is typical of ink-wash art.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the arm and hand positions of the figures show natural joint alignment and fluid motion, with no bent or missing fingers or unnatural limb extensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures display arm and hand positions that reflect natural joint alignment and fluid motion. This is consistent with the stylized movement typical of traditional Chinese figures in ink paintings, where gestures are well-considered and fluid. There are no bent or missing fingers, nor any unnatural limb extensions visible.",

      "question": "Are the ink-style elements (figures, willows, lotuses, mountains) harmoniously integrated into the scene with consistent lighting, shadow, and depth cues, and do they avoid appearing detached or misplaced?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates ink-style figures, willows, lotuses, and mountains with consistent artistic cues. The lighting, shadow, and depth are cohesive, giving a harmonious appearance typical of such art. The elements are appropriately placed and do not appear detached or misplaced, maintaining the integrity of a unified scene.",
