      "question": "Are the illustrated blueberries and text labels seamlessly integrated into the pie surface without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blueberries are illustrated and placed on the pie surface. The text labels are positioned around the pie slice. Upon close observation, the blueberries appear cartoonish which matches the style of the image but may not seamlessly integrate with the pie in terms of realistic shadows or texture. However, the overall integration including edges and pixelation reflects a consistent illustration style. Therefore, while not realistic, they are integrated well within the illustrative context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the anthropomorphic version of the mug retain the original cylindrical shape and handle position without stretching, warping, or breaking the object's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mug in Image B has been transformed into a cartoon anthropomorphic design, featuring eyes, a mouth, and limbs, which alters its form. Despite these changes, the foundation including the cylindrical shape and the handle position appear consistent with a typical mug structure. The cartoon features do not stretch or warp the cylindrical form excessively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chart positioned clearly within the frame without overlapping or obscuring the pie slice, mug, or plate, and does it have clean lines and legible text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a chart-like illustration with text and diagrams. The design avoids overlapping directly over the pie slice and mug, ensuring clarity in viewing each component distinctly. Despite the illustrative font style making the text less legible due to its playful distortion, it remains positioned clearly without obstructing other elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the warm pastel tones applied evenly across the scene without causing unnatural discoloration of the ceramic, glass, or baked pie surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warm pastel tones contribute to the overall playful and illustrative theme. These tones dominate the background and elements, including the pie, without causing unnatural discoloration of objects like the plate or mug. They help maintain a consistent color palette typical for cereal box art or infographics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pie slice, mug, plate, and table maintain their original geometric forms and spatial relationships without any visible warping, fragmentation, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements such as the pie slice, mug, and plate maintain their geometric forms as tailored to the illustrative style. The transformation to a cartoon design alters these forms from realistic to an illustrative representation but maintains relative spatial alignment, avoiding significant warping or fragmentation while presenting a coherent illustrative scheme.",
