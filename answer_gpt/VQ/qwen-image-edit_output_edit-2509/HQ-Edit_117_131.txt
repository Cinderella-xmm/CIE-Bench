    "Question": "Q1: Does the pastel purple fur with teal accents maintain natural fur texture and gradient transitions across the body, particularly on the tail and back, without visible color blocking or artificial smoothing?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a cartoonish squirrel with pastel purple fur and teal accents. Despite the unreal colors, the transition between them is intended to be smooth, resembling gradient shading typical in digital illustrations. The tail shows a soft blending of colors rather than harsh boundaries, maintaining a visual flow that's consistent with artistic conventions. Therefore, the fur maintains a natural texture within the context of a cartoon illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the backpack positioned correctly on the squirrel’s back without deforming its posture or causing unnatural bulges in the fur, and does it display consistent material texture and shadowing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is correctly positioned in relation to the squirrel’s body, aligned naturally with its back. There’s a smooth integration with the fur, without causing any unnatural deformation or bulge. The texture of the backpack is fitting for a cartoon environment, with shadows and highlights consistent with the lighting in the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the glasses positioned symmetrically over the squirrel’s eyes with proper reflection details and soft shadows, and do they not distort the eye area or appear disproportionately large?",
    "explanation": "The glasses in Image B are placed symmetrically over the squirrel's eyes, maintaining proportional size that matches the cartoon style. They contain reflection details and soft shadows that respect the lighting scheme, and do not appear to distort the eye area.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the integration of the squirrel into the new forest background seamless, with no visible edge artifacts, mismatched lighting, or floating elements around the feet and tail?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the squirrel seamlessly integrated into the forest background. There are no visible edge artifacts, and the lighting is consistent across the squirrel and the background. The feet and tail are set naturally into the environment without signs of floating or mismatch.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the cartoonish flowers and mushrooms positioned at plausible distances from the squirrel, showing correct occlusion and depth cues, and do they have consistent textures and shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers and mushrooms are positioned around the squirrel at plausible distances, with appropriate occlusion that reflects depth. The shading and texture are consistent with the cartoon style, contributing to a coherent and believable setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the title banner positioned above the squirrel at a reasonable height, with legible text and soft shadows that match the scene’s lighting, without overlapping key elements like the squirrel’s head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner is positioned above the squirrel at a reasonable height, ensuring the squirrel's visual space is respected. The text is clear and legible, and soft shadows align with the scene lighting without overlapping with the squirrel’s head, maintaining clarity and scene composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
