    "Question": "Q1: Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are holographic widgets and 3D elements showcased on the smartphone screen. These elements protrude and extend beyond the physical screen, creating a futuristic and augmented reality effect. However, these widgets and 3D elements are intended to look like projections rather than being integrated with the phone's surface. The depth cues and shadowing do not exactly match the phone's form factor because they are meant to look like hovering elements separate from the screen surface.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone displays a holographic forward-projection effect. The elements are visually coherent but extend beyond the screen edges to convey a sense of augmented reality. There are no distortions of the phone's frame or screen edges that break immersion. The spatial relationship between the hand and the phone remains consistent, with the hand gripping the phone without awkward overlap or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the biometric overlay is depicted as a digital hand display over the natural hand. The overlay aligns well with the hand's anatomy, capturing the finger positions accurately without visible errors such as extra fingers or distorted proportions. The alignment is intended to look futuristic and matches with the hand's natural anatomy well enough for a sci-fi depiction, focusing on the visual fit rather than detailed texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the laptop screen shows a rendered futuristic skyline. The geometry and perspective of the skyline are consistent with a realistic skyline view. The image is integrated with the laptop's screen without clipping issues or misalignment with the bezel. The scene seems cohesive with the laptop's physical boundaries, fitting within the frame of the monitor.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the smartphone and laptop screens display interfaces with a consistent blue color palette, futuristic elements, and digital interfaces that convey a high-tech aesthetic. The use of holographic and sci-fi inspired illustrations and typography align well together, providing a cohesive narrative across both devices. There is no noticeable conflict in stylistic elements between the two interface designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
