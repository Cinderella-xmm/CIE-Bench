      "question": "Are Mona Lisa's facial features, such as her eyes, nose, mouth, and smile, rendered naturally without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the Mona Lisa are blurred, so it is not possible to assess or identify any artifacts related to the eyes, nose, mouth, or smile. Thus, due to the lack of visible detail, it's impossible to definitively answer the question based on the image itself.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color adaptation around Mona Lisa is presented in a Studio Ghibli style, which is known for its smooth color blends and harmonious palettes.

      "question": "Does the edited background in Studio Ghibli style retain its visual plausibility and avoid breaking the geometric shapes seen in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been altered to reflect the Studio Ghibli style, which is characterized by imaginative landscapes with soft colors and rounded shapes. While the geometric forms from the original painting are not all present, the reimagined background maintains visual plausibility within the context of a Studio Ghibli-style setting, achieving a coherent and harmonious look that fits the animated aesthetic.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, Mona Lisa's dress has been reimagined in a simpler, more cartoon-like style. Despite being different from the original's realistic depiction, the textures and folds appear consistent with the animated style and do not exhibit unnatural patterns. The dress maintains an overall believable appearance in line with animation stylings.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Mona Lisa's hands are drawn in a simple yet clear manner typical for animation styles. The fingers are correctly counted and the hands are positioned in a natural, ergonomic way, consistent with how hands are realistically portrayed in such styles. The adaptation maintains naturalness in this aspect.",
