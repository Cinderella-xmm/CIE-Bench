    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
    "explanation": "The glass display case in Image B appears well-defined with clean, smooth edges that display proper transparency, allowing clear visibility of the car and landscape within the case without any sections appearing misaligned or floating. This conclusion is drawn from observing the outlined frame and the visible contents inside, showing smooth continuity in the case design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the carâ€™s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car displays a well-maintained metallic red coloring that transitions smoothly across its surface, highlighting the glossy gradient effects consistent with a polished finish. The sharp detail lines along the body panels are preserved, maintaining the intricacy and precision in the car design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
    "explanation": "The resin layers depicted in the road and cliff areas of Image B show visually distinct elements with gradual transparency adding depth cues effectively. There are no flat or uniformly colored regions, as demonstrated by the varying colors and textures suggesting layered depth from multiple perspectives.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
    "explanation": "The micro gravel texture in Image B appears evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces. There is natural variation in the size of gravel, creating a more realistic effect devoid of any repetitive or artificial patterning, enhancing the natural landscape setup within the display.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
    "explanation": "The sunset sky panel in Image B blends seamlessly with the surrounding sky. The color gradients are smooth, and the horizon aligns well, maintaining consistency without visible seams or clipping, which ensures a cohesive visual transition from land to sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case follow a visually coherent miniature scale. The relationships between these elements are portrayed realistically, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizes, maintaining an appropriate scaling typical of a miniature display.",
    "answer": "Yes"
