      "question": "Do the simplified human figures and the background tent maintain their structural coherence without introducing unnatural geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures and the background tent have been transformed into simplified silhouettes, which can be assessed for coherence based on their shape integrity and the absence of awkward geometric distortions. The figures and tent appear smooth and consistent with traditional silhouette art, avoiding any unusual angles or shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors restricted only to blues, whites, and the man's green shirt, and do they appear natural without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B primarily utilizes a blue and white color palette, creating a cohesive and stylized look common in graphic art, while also maintaining the green highlight where the man's shirt was originally. This limited color scheme appears uniform and balanced without any texture elements breaking the visual consistency.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' integrate seamlessly into the upper cloudy sky region without disrupting the natural appearance of the clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'SKATE FOR ALL' is placed at the top part of the image, overlaying the cloudy sky area. The text appears to be artistically integrated, sitting well with the stylization of the background, without cutting through or disrupting the visual flow of the clouds.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the human figures and skateboards maintained realistically, avoiding any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains consistent proportions in the human figures and skateboards, adhering to the stylized approach. This suggests preservation of realistic scaling as seen when comparing to natural human and object dimensions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the skateboards and clothing been preserved without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details are stylized to a silhouette form where fine details are not depicted traditionally but rather captured through shape and outline. This method does not feature unnecessary or unnatural textures, adhering instead to the silhouette art form that's expected in this context.",
