    "Question": "Q1: Does the crystal orb surrounding the castle have clean, unbroken edges without visible distortion or bending of the castle’s structure inside it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal orb encases the castle, acting like a snow globe, which typically has a smooth, spherical shape. The edges are clear and distinct, without distorting the view of the castle it surrounds. This visual representation suggests careful design to ensure no bending or distortion occurs within the orb itself.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the clouds positioned above the castle without overlapping or clipping through any architectural elements, and do they have soft, natural-looking edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B features stylized clouds inside the orb, with smooth, rounded edges that do not interfere or clip through the architectural features of the castle. They maintain a soft appearance, reflecting typical artist representations of clouds, and add to the magical ambiance without disrupting the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the vines climb the castle walls from the bottom upward, following the wall contours without breaking the stone texture or appearing to float in mid-air?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the vines appear integrated with the castle walls starting from the base and extending upwards, suggesting a natural growth pattern. They adhere to the contours of the architecture and are visually consistent with the castle’s stone textures, avoiding any floating appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the gem-like flowers placed within the garden beds at a natural scale, with no excessive glare or repeating textures that indicate artificial rendering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gem-like flowers are depicted in vibrant colors, positioned in the garden area surrounding the castle. They are scaled appropriately to suggest a fantastical setting without any signs of excessive glare or repetitive patterns that would indicate poor rendering. Their placement suggests an artistic choice to enhance the magical theme.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the dragon positioned on a stable part of the central tower, proportionally small compared to the structure, and casting a shadow aligned with the ambient light source?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon is perched on top of the central tower of the castle, reasonably sized compared to the structure. Its positioning is secure, and it appears to cast a shadow consistent with the light source, suggesting careful consideration in its rendering and placement.",

    "Question": "Q7: Are all added elements (orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, base) structurally coherent with the original castle, showing no broken lines, floating components, or conflicting lighting?",
    "explanation": "The additions in Image B with the castle—orb, clouds, vines, dragon, flowers, and base—are visually coherent, maintaining structural integrity without any broken lines or elements appearing to float in an artificial manner. Lighting and shadowing are consistent across these elements, ensuring a harmonious integration with the central castle structure.",
