      "question": "Are the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves with consistent shading and no jagged edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe are analyzed by examining the shapes and edges of the leaves. These leaves are smooth and have an organic appearance, with consistent shading that indicates a cohesive design. There are no visual indications of jagged edges or pixelation, suggesting that they have been carefully designed to look natural and integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal footprints are analyzed by observing their arrangement and spacing. The prints appear to be randomly placed rather than following a coherent path indicative of movement from the giraffe toward the edge of the room. Additionally, the depth and spacing do not seem to match typical animal gait patterns, indicating that they are more decorative than representative of motion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clear packaging around each plush toy transparent with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toyâ€™s shape beneath, consistent with real plastic wrap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any clear packaging around the plush toys. The plush toys appear unwrapped and freely positioned on the floor, with no visual evidence of transparency, surface highlights, or shape distortion that would suggest the presence of real plastic wrap.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the colorful letters on the wall aligned properly with the wall surface, showing no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature colorful letters on the wall. Instead, there is text in the form of a title 'Jungle Friends Adventure' prominently displayed at the top of the image. The text is aligned properly with the overall design, having no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling. Therefore, the related question seems not applicable to the visible content.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comparison between the giraffe in both images is made by focusing on its proportions and texture. In Image B, the giraffe maintains a similar proportion and soft fabric texture compared to Image A. There is no visual evidence of stretching, flattening, or seams that seem unnatural, indicating that the transformation has preserved the original characteristics of the giraffe plush toy.",
