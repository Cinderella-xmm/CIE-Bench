    "Question": "Q1: Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skeletal wing-like extensions are depicted emerging from the rock arch. To determine their natural and seamless emergence, we observe the connection points and angles where these extensions meet the rock surface. The extensions must maintain continuity with the rock's edges, avoiding gaps or floating sections that would appear unnatural. The extensions should align with the arch's shape and follow the expected physical structure. The image shows the extensions with visual continuity and integration into the existing rock structure, without any noticeable gaps or unnatural angles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the crystalline growths along the arch’s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, crystalline growths are added along the arch's curve. To assess their integration with the rock, we analyze their texture and color in relation to the rock surface. The crystals should mimic the rock's natural material properties in color, texture, and sheen. If the crystals exhibit excessive gloss or highlights that do not reflect the ambient lighting and material of the rock, they would appear unnatural. The image shows the crystals with color and texture that contrast noticeably with the surrounding rock, having highlights and gloss beyond what would naturally blend with the rock.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, glowing veins are added to the rock surface. To determine if they follow natural mineral-like patterns, we examine their layout and emission quality. Natural patterns should be organic and irregular, while the light emission should be smooth and continuous. Jagged edges or blocky artifacts would disrupt the realism and expected mineral-like appearance. The image demonstrates glowing veins with continuous light emission, following flowing patterns reminiscent of natural mineral veins without any jagged or blocky artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, runic symbols are carved into the rock's inner surface. To evaluate their appearance, we look for consistent depth and shadowing that reflects the erosion process seen in naturally occurring rock surfaces. These runes should blend with the textural qualities of the rock. The depth should be uniform and shadows should follow naturally as would occur with erosion. The image reveals symbols that have a uniform depth carved into the rock, but the shadow and textural mismatch with natural erosion suggest they do not fully integrate with the rock’s natural characteristics.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a radiant orb is presented, emitting light. To assess its realism, we examine the light direction and intensity matching the ambient lighting of the scene. The orb should cast soft shadows and create reflections consistent with the existing lighting and rock surface textures. These factors contribute to a cohesive integration into the environment. The image reveals the orb emitting light that does not consistently match the ambient direction and lacks realistic shadow casting on the surrounding rock, leading to an appearance inconsistent with natural lighting conditions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the arch includes additional elements. We assess whether these elements preserve the original ground textures, such as rocks, cracks, and soil, without distortion or obscuring. These textures should remain consistent with Image A, maintaining environmental continuity. Comparing the ground textures in Image B with those in Image A, the added elements do not obscure or distort the ground features, allowing them to remain undisturbed. Thus, the preservation of ground textures is achieved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
