      "question": "Are the wood grain patterns across the surface of the boot evenly distributed and consistent with natural wood textures, avoiding artificial or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B shows the boot featuring wood grain patterns. Natural wood typically exhibits uneven, complex grain patterns that are not repetitive but vary naturally over a surface. By examining the boot closely, the wood grain patterns appear consistent with natural variations in wood and do not show obvious signs of artificial or repetitive designs, which would be apparent as identical patterns or unnaturally regular lines. Thus, the patterns look naturally distributed and consistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transitions between light and dark wood tones on the boot follow the same contour and depth as the original leather and rubber sections, ensuring no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boot in Image B has been visually transformed to resemble a wooden material. Typically, smooth transitions in wood tones along contours suggest realism, following the shape and depth similarly to leather textures. The transitions appear gradual, maintaining the original boot's contour and depth, which suggests no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color that would look out of place compared to natural leather sections. This renders the transformation convincingly realistic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas shaped precisely like the original metal hardware and fabric loops, without deformation or missing structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas are transformed into wood material but retain their original shapes from the hardware and fabric loops as seen in Image A. The loops and holes maintain a precise form despite the change in texture, indicating that there are no missing or deformed elements in the structural design due to the transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden shelf flat, stable, and properly aligned beneath the boot, with no visible warping, floating, or unsupported edges that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot rests on a wooden shelf that appears flat and stable. The alignment and perspective show the shelf's equipoise, suggesting that it is appropriately supporting the boot without any visual distortions or misalignments, like warping or floating edges. Such defects would be inconsistent with physical logic where the shelf visibly supports the weight and structure of the boot uniformly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot retain its original three-dimensional shape, including toe box, heel, and ankle support, without any stretching, flattening, or irregular bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a boot designed to resemble wood material while maintaining its three-dimensional shape. Features like the toe box, heel, and ankle support appear intact, retaining the original structural design. There is no noticeable stretching, flattening, or bulging that would alter the boot's constructed silhouette or indicate a deviation from its initial design. This suggests the boot's shape is preserved accurately post-transformation.",
