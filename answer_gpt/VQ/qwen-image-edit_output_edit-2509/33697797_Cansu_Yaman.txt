    "Question": "Q1: Do the transformed plants maintain recognizable plant-like structures without unnatural appendages or disproportionate body parts?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the transformed plants retain an overall plant-like appearance, characterized by natural-looking leaves and stems. However, they have additional fantastical features, such as embedded patterns and mystical orbs around them. While these elements are more imaginative, the core structures still resemble plants without extraneous appendages or disproportionate body forms that deviate significantly from customary botanical forms.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the magical orbs replace the original flowers in the same positions and emit light that interacts realistically with nearby surfaces and shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the magical orbs are positioned throughout the scene among the transformed plants. These orbs emit glowing light that interacts with the surrounding objects, exhibiting reflections and ambient light effects. This lighting creates plausible shadows and highlights on nearby surfaces, adding realism to their interaction within the environment.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the iridescent foliage cascade from the ceiling in a way that follows the structural lines of the roof frame and allows light to diffuse naturally through its layers?",
    "explanation": "The iridescent foliage seen in Image B cascades downward, showing a luminous quality that diffuses light throughout the scene. While there is no visible roof frame like in Image A, the foliage is depicted with dynamic lighting effects that create a natural diffusion of light within its colorful layers, enhancing its realistic integration into the environment.",
