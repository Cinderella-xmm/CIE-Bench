      "question": "Does the glass container maintain the original circular shape and proportions of the compass body, with no warped edges or irregular thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container retains a circular shape and uniform proportions throughout its design. The absence of warped edges or irregular thickness can be assessed by the smooth and consistent outline of the container, suggesting it closely adheres to the regular shape seen in the original compass body in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle centered within the glass container, aligned with the pivot point of the original needle, and does it have a smooth, continuous metallic surface without jagged edges or textural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spray nozzle in Image B appears to be centrally positioned in the glass container, indicating alignment with the pivot point where the compass needle was originally located in Image A. The surface of the spray nozzle shows no jagged edges or textural inconsistencies, conveying a continuous metallic surface that is visually smooth.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cap feature a detailed engraving of a vintage map that is evenly distributed across its surface, with no blurred lines or inconsistent depth, and is it attached seamlessly to the top of the glass container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cap has a detailed engraving that represents intricate designs, although it isn't a vintage map as described, suggesting variance from expectations. The engraving is evenly distributed and shows consistent depth without blurred lines. The cap appears to be attached seamlessly to the glass container, indicating thoughtful design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bronze gradient applied smoothly across the glass container and cap, with subtle variations in tone that simulate wear and light reflection, and no sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze gradient in Image B is smoothly applied across both the glass container and cap. Visual cues show subtle variations in tone, simulating natural wear and light reflection effectively. There are no sharp color boundaries or noticeable artificial sheen, contributing to a realistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branding text visible along the outer rim of the glass container, with consistent font size and spacing, and does it appear embedded into the surface without overlapping or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, branding text is visible along the outer rim of the glass container. The font size and spacing appear consistent, and the text seems embedded seamlessly into the surface, without any overlapping or floating effects. This suggests a coherent integration of text within the container design.",
