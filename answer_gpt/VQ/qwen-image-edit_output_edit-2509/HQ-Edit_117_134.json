      "question": "Does the surface of the piano exhibit a uniform caramel color with visible white and gold icing details that resemble real edible decoration, without unnatural textures or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a piano that, upon closer examination, shows a consistent caramel color across its surface. The details, such as the white and gold icing patterns, are intricate and resemble real edible decoration, typically seen on items like gingerbread cookies. There are no visible digital artifacts or textures that seem unnatural for an object designed to appear as a realistic, edible model. The visual cues align well with a traditional decorative style, ensuring the perception of authenticity in the edible design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and spatial relationships of the pianoâ€™s components (lid, body, legs, pedals) preserved and correctly aligned, with no visible deformation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the proportions and spatial relationships of the piano components appear consistent and correctly aligned. The lid, body, legs, and pedals maintain appropriate proportions relative to each other, similar to how a grand piano is typically structured. There are no visible deformations or distortions in the geometric shapes of the piano components, suggesting a well-maintained and artistically accurate representation.",

      "question": "Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon evaluating Image B, the transition to a caramel color is indeed seamless. The use of soft gradients and the interaction of the caramel with light match the warm lighting present in the ornate room, implying a natural integration of colors. Visual cues indicate a smooth blend, contributing to the cohesive appearance of the piano in its environment.",

      "question": "Do the keys appear as distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard, with no missing or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents piano keys that resemble distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals. These are arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard, reflecting typical arrangement without any missing or misaligned elements. The design is precise and systematic, aligning well with the standard layout of a piano keyboard and the notion of sugar crystals as implied decorative elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white marble tabletop beneath the piano flat, properly scaled, and displaying natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a white marble tabletop beneath the piano. Its surface appears flat and properly scaled. The stone patterns present are typical of natural marble, and the shadows on the tabletop align with the lighting from the chandelier above, indicating a realistic portrayal of marble under specific lighting conditions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the piano and its decorative elements seem sharp and clean. There is no visible pixelation or smudging around the boundaries, which suggests careful attention to detail and resolution consistency. The design maintains clarity across all edges, implying an absence of unnatural blending at boundaries.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the lighting interactions in Image B, the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the direction of the light from the chandelier. These shadows appear soft and naturally diffused, consistent with how light typically behaves when interacting with solid objects and smooth surfaces. The piano's placement and the shadows it casts are congruent with the light source, enhancing realism.",
