      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the avocado is represented using LEGO bricks. Given that LEGO bricks are naturally blocky and squared, it inherently creates a pixelated, jagged appearance especially around curved edges. The avocado slice made of LEGO in Image B displays this usual blocky edge, which cannot achieve a perfectly smooth and curved appearance as the real avocado in Image A does.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, both blueberries and raspberries are recreated using small round LEGO pieces. These LEGO pieces are uniform in size and retain their spherical form without visible merging or irregular shaping that might occur if they were represented otherwise. This parallels their natural, individual rounded look seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is constructed with stacked LEGO bricks that attempt to mimic the natural, tree-like branching structure of broccoli. However, due to the nature of LEGO bricks, the representation is greatly simplified without distinct florets. While it suggests the shape, it lacks the intricate detail of the natural example seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO representation in Image B of the red bell pepper uses a combination of bricks that generally align smoothly without major gaps. However, given LEGOâ€™s blocky nature, certain angular edges and transitions are inevitable, which contrasts the smooth, organic curves seen in the actual bell pepper in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped board is outlined using LEGO bricks, which naturally introduces a step-like, slightly jagged edge due to their squared nature. Therefore, the LEGO outline doesn't exactly replicate the smooth contour of the wooden board in Image A but approximates it in a pixelated form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the asparagus bundle attempts to maintain the same aligned, parallel structure as the real asparagus, using LEGO bricks to replicate both the stalks and the binding twine. The construction effectively mimics the grouped and bound appearance present in Image A with the limitations inherent to LEGO bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a LEGO-style grid base in a uniform gray color. There are no notable lighting discrepancies such as shadows or highlights visible on the base that would suggest any mismatches, depth issues, or texture inconsistencies, unlike the more textured and shadowed wooden surface in Image A.",
