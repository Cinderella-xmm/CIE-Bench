    "Question": "Q1: Are the roof, walls, and window frames of the Japanese house replaced with colored glass panels outlined by black lead without distorting the original building’s geometry or introducing misaligned or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Japanese house has been transformed into a stained glass representation. The roof, walls, and window frames are depicted with colored glass panels separated by black lead outlines. The overall shape and features of the building, such as its geometry and structural integrity, are maintained without introducing misaligned or broken lines. This suggests that the stained glass effect was applied without distorting the original structure of the house.",

    "Question": "Q2: Have the red trees on both sides of the house been converted into symmetrical floral motifs made of red and green glass segments that maintain their original placement and scale without unnatural stretching or fragmentation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red trees are converted into a floral motif, featuring prominently in the stained glass. These motifs are made of red and green glass segments and are placed symmetrically on both sides of the house. The floral motifs maintain the original placement and do not show signs of unnatural stretching or fragmentation, aligning with the intended purpose of capturing the trees' essence in stained glass form.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the red moon represented as a series of concentric gradient circles in stained glass style, with smooth color transitions and no jagged edges or irregularities in its form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red moon is transformed into a series of concentric gradient circles in a stained glass style. The transitions between colors are smooth, and the circles appear regular without any jagged edges or irregularities. This indicates a proper application of stained glass techniques to represent the moon in the desired style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are all structural and decorative lines—such as those framing glass panels, outlining windows, and defining floral motifs—uniform, continuous, and properly aligned without breaks, overlaps, or uneven thickness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the structural and decorative lines are consistently executed, framing the glass panels, outlining the windows, and defining the floral motifs. The lines appear uniform in thickness, continuous, and properly aligned without noticeable breaks or overlaps. This uniformity is crucial in stained glass design to ensure visual cohesion and clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections in the water accurately mirror the stained glass version of the house, red floral trees, and red moon with correct proportions, alignment, and color fidelity, without distortion or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the water accurately mirrors the stained glass version of the house, the red floral trees, and red moon. The proportions, alignment, and color fidelity of these elements are maintained in the reflection without notable distortion or blurring. The clarity and consistency of the reflection demonstrate effective rendering in the image editing process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
