      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition from the realistic depiction of the patient to the pop-art comic design appear smooth without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from realism to pop-art comic design includes bold colors and halftone patterns. The visual shift aligns with typical comic book aesthetics, where textures become simplified and graphic elements are emphasized. This is consistent with the pop-art style that Image B aims to portray. Given the nature of comic art, the transformation does not introduce jarring textures or artifacts, as the style is intentionally distinct and stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the halftone patterns and bold graphical details added to the image consistent with the rest of the scene and do not look out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone patterns are used as a fundamental element of pop-art comic designs, typically filling areas with dots to create shading and texture. In Image B, these halftone patterns are applied across various elements like the wall, medical equipment, and clothing uniformly and consistently. There is no distortion or mismatch, and the style fits the overall comic book design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the core elements like the IV stand, monitors, and nurse retain their structural integrity and remain visually credible within the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the IV stand, monitors, and nurse have transitioned into the pop-art style while maintaining their fundamental structure. The outlines are bold, enhancing definition without altering their structural integrity. These features remain identifiable and coherent, which is characteristic of a well-executed comic design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the shapes of objects such as the bed, pillows, and medical equipment been preserved without distortion or damage in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms these objects into the pop-art aesthetic while preserving their shapes. The bed, pillows, and medical equipment maintain their original forms and proportions, albeit with stylistic changes in color and texture. The transition focuses on graphic enhancement without distorting the physical characteristics of the objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the patient's facial features and the nurse's uniform preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While facial features are blurred, the nurse's uniform in Image B is depicted appropriately within the pop-art style. Details such as the uniform's shape and wrinkles are still recognizable, adapted to the simplified lines and bold colors of comic art. The transformation adheres to pop-art norms, focusing less on minute details and more on dynamic colors and patterns.",
