      "question": "Does the white border framing the image maintain a clean edge along the entire perimeter without disrupting the natural appearance of the dessert inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white border resembles a Polaroid-style frame, which is typically clean and consistent along its edges. The dessert inside, specifically the cheesecake and bananas, appears unrestricted by the border, suggesting that the frame does not disrupt the natural appearance of the dessert. The border serves as an aesthetic enhancement and does not interfere with the focal content of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light brown vintage filter applied to the image enhance its film-style appearance without causing any parts of the banana slices or whipped cream to appear unnaturally colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light brown filter imparts a vintage look, characteristic of old film styles. This subtle filtering enhances the overall aesthetic without altering the natural colors of the banana slices or whipped cream significantly. Each component of the dessert retains its original color range, as expected based on common knowledge of vintage aesthetics, where subtlety in color alteration is preferred.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handwritten caption \"Banana Cream Dream 2024\" at the bottom clear and legible with a natural look that complements the Polaroid-style photo without seeming out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The caption 'Banana Cream Dream 2024' appears in a handwritten style at the bottom of Image B. This style is consistent with a personal and casual appearance often associated with Polaroid photos. The clarity and legibility of the caption ensure it complements the photographic style, adding to the vintage sentiment without disrupting the visual harmony of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details like the texture of the whipped cream and the smooth surface of the cheesecake slice been preserved without showing any unnatural artifacts or blurring due to the editing effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details in Image B, such as the texture of the whipped cream and the cheesecake slice, appear to be well-preserved despite the vintage filtering and additional framing. World knowledge about image processing suggests that subtle edits like adding filters and borders typically maintain the integrity of such details unless explicitly overdone, which doesn't seem to be the case here.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the newly added Polaroid frame and caption seamlessly integrate with the original image of the cheesecake and bananas, ensuring the dessert remains the focal point and no elements look disjointed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Polaroid-style frame and handwritten caption effectively integrate with the image. The dessert—cheesecake and banana slices—remains prominent, indicating that the added elements do not detract from the image's focal point. The seamless integration is expected from world knowledge on photography aesthetics, where such additions are meant to enhance rather than disrupt visual composition.",
