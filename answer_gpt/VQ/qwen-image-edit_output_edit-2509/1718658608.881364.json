      "question": "Do the ceramic sculptures exhibit a uniform glossy finish with realistic reflections that align with the direction and intensity of the sunset light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features sculptures with a visibly glossy finish. The reflections on the sculptures are consistent with the light source, which is assumed to be similar to sunset light in terms of its soft, warm tone. The reflection on the sculptures aligns well with this lighting condition, giving a realistic effect that suggests a high degree of craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured scales evenly distributed across the sculpture surfaces without visible repetition, distortion, or sharp edges suggesting digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures in the edited image show a surface texture that resembles scales. They appear evenly distributed, and there are no signs of visible repetition or distortion that would indicate digital artifacting. The texture maintains consistency without any sharp edges that could break the realism of a handcrafted ceramic piece.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep oceanic blue coloration of the sculptures consistent across all parts and harmonious with the surrounding ocean and sky colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures are uniformly colored in a deep oceanic blue, which is consistent across all parts of the sculpture, contributing to a harmonious aesthetic. Although the surrounding environment in the edited image does not directly include ocean and sky, the color choice matches what one would expect of a marine-themed sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly sandy-colored with no visible traces of the original ocean, waves, or shoreline elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the background appears as a sandy-colored surface that is smooth and devoid of ocean, waves, or shoreline elements. This transformation is clean and maintains uniformity throughout, successfully removing any visual traces of the original environmental elements from Image A.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a continuous, flowing wave pattern that matches the curvature and rhythm of the original ocean waves in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculptures in the edited image do not depict a flowing wave pattern arrangement similar to the ocean waves seen in Image A. Instead, they are placed in a more static position consistent with the nature of ceramic sculptures. The curvature and rhythm seen in the original image's ocean waves are not present in the arrangement of these sculptures.",
