      "question": "Is the outline of the purple blouse magnet smooth and symmetrical, with recognizable embroidered patterns intact and not blurred or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the blouse shows a symmetrical and smooth outline, with clear ornamental designs that mirror traditional embroidery patterns. These designs are well-defined and not fragmented or blurred. By comparing to Image A, where the blouse features intricate embroidery, the depiction in Image B remains accurate in maintaining these details, supporting that skilled artistry can preserve such patterns.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the lehenga magnet evenly spaced and symmetrically arranged, with no broken or misaligned designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the lehenga show a regular distribution and symmetry across the surface, suggesting careful attention to design coherence. Such an arrangement implies professionalism in the artistic crafting of the magnet, aligning with the structured floral designs visible in Image A. Without visible errors like misalignment, the magnet effectively represents these patterns.",

      "question": "Does the red dupatta magnet show a natural curve at the edge, with the border pattern consistently aligned and not stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the depiction of the red dupatta in Image B, the edge shows a natural curve, and the border pattern follows this curve without inconsistency or distortion. The border maintains a consistent design throughout its length, indicating precision. This design mimics Image A's smoothly flowing and uniformly bordered dupatta, where professional craftsmanship prevents stretching or pattern deviations.",

      "question": "Are the jewelry elements (maang tikka, earrings, bangles) depicted with clear outlines and consistent metallic sheen, without merged or malformed components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry items in Image B exhibit clear outlines and a consistent sheen characteristic of metallic accessories, suggesting high precision in artistic rendering. The depiction avoids merging or deforming components, meaning each piece retains distinctiveness. Image A features similar jewelry accurately, allowing one to infer that Image B maintains these details effectively.",

      "question": "Is the background wall pattern magnet composed of repeated motifs that are evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of repeated motifs that are evenly spaced and align without perceptible seams or distortions, reflecting craftsmanship ensuring design integrity. Similar motifs appear in Image A's wallpaper, suggesting coherent translational artistic methods applied within the magnets, emphasizing seamless pattern preservation.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all six magnets have visibly rounded edges and a uniform glossy surface without uneven reflections or dull spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The magnets in Image B display uniformly rounded edges and a consistently glossy surface appearance, indicating quality material use and production methods. Such consistency ensures that surface reflections maintain uniformity, avoiding dull spots. Though not comparable directly to surfaces in Image A, Image B's presentation ensures high-quality magnet finishes through coherent design practices.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the magnets with distinct spacing, preventing overlap, allowing for clear distinction among items. Given no overlapping sections or crowding within the arrangement, it's clear that strategic artistic layout choices have been made. This is inferred independently of Image A context, though understanding Image B makes certain practices apparent, structured for clear visibility.",
