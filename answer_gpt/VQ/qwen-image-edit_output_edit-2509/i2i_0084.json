      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dog and its blue mat appear consistent with the lighting of a snowy mountain setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues in Image B, the snowy mountain setting is characterized by soft, ambient light that can be observed from the evenly distributed shadows and highlights around the campsite. The lighting on the dog and the blue mat aligns well with this setting; shadows fall naturally on the snowy ground, and highlights on the dog's fur and mat are consistent with the ambient lighting expected in a snowy environment. This integration of light and shadow suggests the elements match the environmental lighting conditions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog's fur retain its natural texture and detail without showing any unnatural artifacts after being placed in the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur appears detailed and textured, consistent with a natural-looking coat. There are no visible signs of blending errors or artifacts, which often occur when an object is artificially placed into a new background. The preservation of the fur's detail, despite the change in setting, indicates a natural integration into the snowy environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the size and proportions of the dog and its blue mat appropriately scaled in relation to the tent and other elements of the snowy campsite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and blue mat are placed in front of a tent and surrounded by camping gear. The size of the dog relative to the tent and fire maintains a realistic proportion, as a typical camping setup for a human would include a tent large enough to accommodate people, while the dog is appropriately sized to fit comfortably in front of it without appearing overly large or small. This realistic scaling maintains coherence in the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dog and its blue mat smoothly integrated into the snowy mountain campsite without any visible jagged or unnatural lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a clean integration of the dog and mat within the snowy campsite. The edges are smooth, with no visible jaggedness, suggesting a careful blending with the snow on the ground. This seamless merging into the background is consistent with natural photo composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dog's posture and the overall layout of the snowy campsite appear natural and free from distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's posture—lying down on the mat—matches a commonplace and relaxed pose expected in a camping scenario. The overall layout, including the arrangement of the tent, campfire, and surroundings, also follows a logical setup typical for an outdoor campsite. This alignment ensures the scene appears natural without any awkward or distorted elements.",
