      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as the eyes and mouth are integrated onto the watch dial. They are carefully placed to avoid covering or obstructing the numerals and subdials, allowing them to remain visible. The blending of these features with the metallic texture of the dial is done effectively, without introducing noticeable shading or edge inconsistencies that would make them appear out of place. The features maintain a coherent appearance with the rest of the dial.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the detective desk and magnifying glass proportionally sized relative to the watch, and are they rendered with consistent line weight and shading that matches the comic style without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detective desk and magnifying glass in Image B are rendered to be proportionate to the overall size of the cartoonish watch character. They maintain a balance in size that fits the comic style depiction where exaggerated proportions are common. The line weight and shading are consistent with the cartoon style, displaying a uniformity without any signs of geometric distortion or inconsistency. The elements fit well within the comic's artistic genre.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements (cluttered office items) appear spatially coherent with the watch, showing correct layering and perspective without overlapping or clipping through the watch's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as the cluttered office items are depicted with spatial coherence, interacting logically with the foreground watch character. The items maintain proper perspective according to their spatial relationship with the watch. There is no noticeable overlapping or clipping through the watch's body, suggesting careful attention to layering, maintaining a believable scene for the viewer.",

      "question": "Are the tick mark sound effects uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered around the dial, without jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features tick mark sound effects that are stylized within the comic. These sound effects are designed to be uniformly shaped, matching the playful and exaggerated style typical of comic illustrations. They are cleanly rendered without showing jagged edges or smudges, and the spacing between each sound tick mark is consistent, maintaining the visual rhythm around the dial.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the stylized version retain the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case, with no visible texture warping or color inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the essential textures of the original black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the watch case. Despite the cartoonish edit, the leather strap continues to show the detailed textures reminiscent of leather, while the silver finish retains its characteristic brushed look. The colors appear consistent with the intended style, avoiding warping or noticeable inconsistencies that would detract from the original watch's materials.",

      "question": "Are the hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window preserved in their original positions and proportions, without being obscured or deformed by the added facial features or other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the watch face is transformed into a character, the essential elements such as the hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window are preserved in their original positions and proportions. The added facial features do not obscure or deform these functional components, allowing the watch to be both a character and maintain its identity as a timepiece.",
