    "Question": "Q1: Are the two towers and the central wall of the fortress proportionally reduced without distortion or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is represented as a miniature model within a terrarium. The towers and central wall appear to be scaled down while retaining the same architectural proportions as the original structure in Image A. There are no visible distortions or breaks in the geometry, suggesting a careful reduction in size that maintains the original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the moss covering the ground exhibit natural texture and color gradients, resembling real moss rather than a uniform or painted surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the moss covering the ground within the terrarium has a varied texture and multiple green shades, which mimic the appearance of real moss. This variation in texture and color provides a natural and realistic look, as opposed to a flat, monotone painted surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the model knights positioned on the moss at a scale consistent with the miniature fortress, and do they rest fully on the ground without floating or intersecting with other elements?",
    "explanation": "The model knights in Image B are appropriately scaled to match the size of the miniature fortress. They appear to be standing firmly on the moss without any visible floating or intersecting with other elements, indicating careful placement consistent with scale and orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the faux stone pathways extend from the fortress base onto the moss with consistent texture and alignment, matching the original stonework without gaps or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stone pathways are seamlessly integrated into the terrarium, extending naturally from the base of the fortress onto the moss. They maintain consistent texture and alignment that match the fortress's original stonework, showing no gaps or misalignments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the glass star transparent and reflective, positioned precisely at the top of the central tower's spire without overlapping or deforming the underlying structure?",
    "explanation": "The glass star in Image B is both transparent and reflective, suggesting a realistic glass material. It is positioned precisely at the top of the central tower's spire, fitting neatly without affecting the underlying structure, indicating accurate positioning and rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the terrarium dome smoothly curved and transparent, enclosing the fortress without visible seams, warping, or optical distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the terrarium dome is depicted as a smooth and transparent glass enclosure. It maintains a continuous curve without visible seams, warping, or optical distortions, offering a clear view of its contents and suggesting high-quality construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the wooden stand beneath the terrarium have visible wood grain, weathering, and design details consistent with vintage craftsmanship, and does it securely support the dome?",
    "explanation": "The wooden stand in Image B shows detailed wood grain and subtle signs of weathering, along with intricate design elements that resemble vintage craftsmanship. It is depicted as securely supporting the terrarium dome, reflecting an attention to detail in its construction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
