    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cloud formations above the explosion composed of distinct geometric shapes that follow the overall contour of the mushroom cloud without disrupting its volumetric form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cloud formations composed of geometric shapes within the mushroom cloud, enhancing the pop art style without disrupting the overall contour of the mushroom cloud. This is a stylized interpretation that maintains the form while adding abstract elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the neon-colored elements in the explosion maintain consistent brightness and contrast relative to the surrounding sky and water, avoiding abrupt or physically implausible luminance shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a consistent level of brightness and contrast between the neon-colored explosion elements and the bright blue sky and water. The pop art style uses vibrant colors with consistent luminance, avoiding abrupt shifts that would appear unrealistic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted with thick black outlines and simplified shapes, positioned correctly along the beach wall without overlapping or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features palm trees drawn with thick black outlines, consistent with pop art style, and are appropriately positioned along the beach wall without overlaps or misalignments. The simplified shapes ensure a clean depiction typical of the artistic genre.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the islandâ€™s terrain been reduced to abstract geometric shapes that maintain correct spatial relationships with the sea and horizon, without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island's terrain is depicted using abstract geometric shapes, but they maintain correct spatial relationships with the surrounding sea and horizon, ensuring that elements appear connected and not disjointed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sky and water rendered with flat colors and clean outlines, matching the pop art style, without visible texture degradation or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases sky and water in flat colors with clean outlines characteristic of pop art. There is no visible texture degradation, and lighting effects match the stylized approach, maintaining uniformity and clarity.",
