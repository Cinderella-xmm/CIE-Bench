      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a rounded, soft-bodied shape with no visible distortion in limbs or head, and does it maintain a natural posture consistent with a seated stuffed animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pigeon appears to be a plush toy with a soft and rounded body, characterized by smooth curves and a lack of rigid or angular surfaces. The head, wings, and body blend seamlessly into each other, suggesting a stuffed animal made of fabric. The posture is natural for a plush toy, as it sits comfortably on the carved surface, mimicking how a real bird might rest but with the softer and more simplified features typical of plush toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue and gray areas on the plush pigeonâ€™s body evenly colored with soft transitions, and do the feather-like patterns appear as continuous, low-relief designs on fabric rather than sharp, digital lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon exhibits an even coloration with smooth transitions between blue and gray areas. The transition in colors appears soft, indicative of how stuffing under fabric would create a gentle gradient. The feather-like patterns are stylized impressions on the plush fabric, resembling embroidered or printed patterns rather than sharply defined digital graphics, capturing the essence of a handcrafted or mass-produced plush toy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the architectural elements (columns, arch, distant buildings) display a uniform, matte surface with visible embossed details that resemble cookie dough or icing, and do they lack shiny reflections or metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements are designed to have a cookie-like appearance with a uniform matte texture throughout. The columns, arch, and buildings possess intricate embossed details that recall stylized icing or molded dough patterns, suggesting a credit to a confectionery theme. They lack any shiny reflections which would otherwise indicate a metallic or glossy material, thereby maintaining a consistent visual theme indicative of baking or design elements made from edible-looking materials.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden shelf beneath the plush pigeon that is flat, horizontally aligned, and has visible wood grain and natural edge wear, with a shadow extending downward and to the right consistent with the sky light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a separate wooden shelf specifically recognizable as distinct from the broader, decorative base on which the plush pigeon rests. The surface is treated as part of the overarching decorative bases and motifs, closely resembling carved or decorated surfaces rather than distinct wooden shelves. Without an identifiable shelf with wood grain and associated shadows, the answer aligns with an absence of a clear separate wooden element.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all elements in the image (plush pigeon, shelf, cookie structures) share the same lighting direction and shadow behavior, with no overlapping shadows or missing occlusions that suggest inconsistent depth or positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent across key elements. The plush pigeon, the decorative features resembling cookie structures, and surrounding motifs exhibit shadows that extend downward and to the right, aligning with a single light source direction. There are no conflicting shadows or elements that disrupt the perceived depth, ensuring a coherent composition where each object sits naturally within its space.",
