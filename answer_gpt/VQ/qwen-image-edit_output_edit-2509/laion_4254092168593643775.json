        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we analyze the silhouette of the rider on a motorcycle depicted in a graphic illustration style. The rider's posture appears natural, with elbows bent and legs positioned to fit the motorcycle appropriately, adhering to standard proportions seen in typical motorbike riding stance. There is no indication of elongated or compressed limbs, suggesting correct proportion and joint alignment.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand streaks behind the motorcycle are depicted in a graphic style, suggesting speed and movement. The streaks are smoothly blended within the illustration context without abrupt cuts or inconsistencies, following the forward motion of the motorcycle, which aligns with the concept of motion blur seen in dynamic action illustrations.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'RaceFuel' in Image B is bold and prominently placed at the top with clear legibility. It does not overlap with the rider or motorcycle, allowing both the textual and graphic elements to stand out individually. The design choice appears intentional, enhancing visual appeal while maintaining readability within the graphic.",

      "question": "Does the track outline in the upper-right corner form a continuous, closed loop without self-intersections or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The track outline in Image B is depicted as a stylized path in the upper-right corner, indicating a smooth, continuous loop without intersections or breaks. This style often represents a complete course in racing graphics, underscoring that it aligns with common visual representations of closed loops.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speedometer icon is placed at the bottom right corner. The dial is stylized but clear, with the needle pointing towards maximum speed, indicating high energy or motion. The overall depiction is visually coherent and uses space effectively within the graphic constraints, maintaining clarity and non-deformed elements.",
