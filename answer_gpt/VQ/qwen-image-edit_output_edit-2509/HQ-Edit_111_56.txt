    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the ballerina’s body show consistent marble texture with subtle chisel marks across all areas including arms, torso, legs, and face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted as a statue with a consistent marble texture across her body. The hallmark of marble sculpture is its seamless surface with occasional subtle chisel marks indicating artistic craftsmanship. Observing the arms, torso, and legs, they all exhibit a continuous and uniform marble appearance, with the surface contributing to the detailed sculptural effect. This suggests that the marble texture is uniformly applied throughout the statue.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the folds and flow of the robe draped over the ballerina's body physically plausible and consistent with how heavy fabric would hang on a sculpted form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe's folds and flow exhibit a realistic portrayal of how heavy fabric would settle on a statue. Marble sculptures often mimic the weight and flow of fabric through intricate carving to create lifelike draping. Here, the flow and positioning of each fold in the robe convincingly simulate the weight of heavy fabric, sitting naturally and comfortably atop the figure without defying gravity. This aligns with the sculptural techniques used in classical representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the laurel wreath positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape or causing misalignment with facial features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the laurel wreath sits atop the head in a manner that maintains the integrity of the figure's head shape and alignment. Sculptures typically incorporate accessories such as wreaths or crowns without showcasing distortion in proportions. The wreath here seamlessly blends with the statue's style, aligning well with sculptural anatomy and proportions, without any apparent mismatch between the wreath and the head's realistic shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the feet retain proper human anatomy and alignment while appearing as carved stone, with no deformation or disproportionate elongation?",
    "explanation": "The feet in Image B, carved from stone, exhibit accurate anatomical representation consistent with human form. In classical and modern sculpture, maintaining body proportion is essential. The placement and shape of the feet appear anatomically correct, with arches, toes, and alignment intact, suggesting skilled craftsmanship in maintaining sculpture anatomy and dimensions without any observable distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the Ionic columns and mosaic floor aligned with the figure’s scale and perspective, showing no mismatch in depth or proportion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements such as Ionic columns and mosaic floor are integrated into the scene with correct perspective and scale. The columns are appropriately aligned concerning the statue's placement, emphasizing coherence in depth with the surrounding environment. The mosaic floor further supports the scene's perspective, aligning well with the figure's dimensions. This spatial arrangement demonstrates a harmonious balance between the architectural surroundings and the sculptural figure, maintaining consistent proportional perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
