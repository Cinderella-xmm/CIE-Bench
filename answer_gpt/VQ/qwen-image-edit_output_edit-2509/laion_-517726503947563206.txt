    "Question": "Q1: Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hull of the ship is depicted with a translucent and iridescent appearance, typical of crystal structures. The surface reflects light, causing color shifts that appear smooth and consistent across the hull, which aligns with the properties of well-rendered crystal. There are no visible blocky or repeated patterns that would indicate poor texture synthesis.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows have been transformed into gem-like shapes with facets, which is characteristic of crystal structures. These facets reflect light naturally, and the edges of these gem-like shapes are sharp and prominent. There is a consistent depth to each shape, reinforcing the realistic interpretation of gemstones.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the deck surfaces of the ship are rendered as crystal pathways. These surfaces appear continuous and structured, without any visible floating elements or cracks. The transition between crystal and other areas is smooth, which indicates a coherent crystal design throughout the deck.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
    "explanation": "The superstructure of the ship in Image B exhibits angular and faceted crystal geometry. The edges are clean, and the entire structure maintains correct proportions relative to the rest of the ship, avoiding any problems with warped or collapsed geometry. This clarity and precision are expected in faceted crystal designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been simplified to a minimalistic horizon, with the distant islands either softened in appearance or removed entirely. The transition between the water and the sky is smooth, with no visible breaks or mismatches in brightness, contributing to a serene and clean visual composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
    "explanation": "The crystal ship in Image B is correctly positioned on the water surface, with no parts appearing to float unnaturally or a misaligned base. The ship maintains a proper scale in relation to the surrounding water and horizon, suggesting accurate placement and orientation within the image context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
    "explanation": "The crystal surfaces in Image B do not exhibit repetitive patterns, blurred edges, or ghosting effects, which would indicate poor digital synthesis or artifacts. Instead, the crystal is rendered with clarity and precision, reflecting light naturally and maintaining a high-quality visual appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
