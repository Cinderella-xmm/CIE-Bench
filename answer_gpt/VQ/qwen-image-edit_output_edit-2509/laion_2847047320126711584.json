      "question": "Are the sugar-crusted armor details on the donut surfaces uniform and free from unnatural pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut characters' surfaces are adorned with sugar crusts that resemble armor. The consistency and texture can be judged by looking for uniformity in sugar distribution and any visible signs of pixelation or repeated patterns, which would indicate editing errors. The cartoonish style of Image B maintains a smooth and uniform appearance on the donut surfaces, making it look naturally illustrated rather than artificially edited with visible pixelation. Hence, the sugar-crusted armor details appear uniform and free from such flaws.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the doughy limbs extend naturally from the donut bodies without distorting the circular shape or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the donut characters emerge from their bodies, and their integration can be evaluated by how seamlessly they connect to the body's outline. Analysis involves checking if the limbs appear as natural extensions of the bodies without disrupting the inherent circular shape of the donuts or leaving disjointed segments that float independently. The limbs in the edited image are cartoonishly stylized but adhere to the bodies without obvious distortion or floating segments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the icing eyes placed within the visible surface area of each donut and aligned with the curvature of the dough, avoiding floating or misaligned features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut characters are endowed with eyes created using icing. Evaluation involves checking whether these eyes are placed in sync with the donut surface, aligned according to the dough's curvature, and do not appear as if they are positioned above or detached from the donut. The image shows the eyes clearly adhering to the facial area of each character, matching the dough's curvature, thus appearing properly integrated.",

      "question": "Are the marshmallow spears and chocolate shields proportionate to the donut characters and correctly oriented as if being held or used?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features donut characters with accessories like spears and shields. Proportion evaluation requires checking if these tools are sized sensibly in relation to the characters, and whether they look like they are being actively wielded or utilized. In the comic, the spears and shields appear adequately proportioned to the characters, with their placement and orientation giving the impression of realistic use.",

      "question": "Is the coffee mug fortress positioned at a plausible scale and distance relative to the donut characters, without appearing unnaturally large or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a coffee mug that serves as a fortress relative to the donut characters. Its scale is assessed by observing if the mug’s size and positioning are reasonable given the donut characters’ anthropomorphic depiction. The mug appears scaled and positioned plausibly within the narrative context of the comic scene, maintaining size consistency without distortion.",

      "question": "Are the playful fonts legible and cleanly outlined, with no pixelation or color bleeding at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes text with playful fonts. Legibility and clarity are analyzed by examining the edges for any pixelation or color bleeding, which would hinder readability. The text in the comic is clear, legibly readable, with crisp edges devoid of pixelation or color bleed, ensuring it stands out against the background without visual confusion.",

      "question": "Are the two comic panels clearly delineated and aligned in a way that supports readable narrative progression without visual confusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two panels make up the comic. Evaluation of panel clarity involves checking alignment, boundaries, and narrative flow suggesting logical progression. The panels are distinctly separated, aligned uniformly on a grid that supports storytelling, confirming that the narrative follows a coherent sequence aiding comprehension.",
