      "question": "Does the airplane maintain its structural consistency despite being transformed into a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is depicted as a stylized 3D cartoon character. It possesses exaggerated features typical of the chibi style, such as a rounded, oversized face and large eyes. However, it retains key structural elements such as wings, engines, and landing gear, consistent with the original concept of an airplane. The chibi style focuses on cuteness and simplification, which can alter proportions but maintain the core aspects recognizably. Therefore, the structural consistency is maintained within the parameters of a stylized depiction.",

Their integration is seamless, and they fit harmoniously into the cartoonish style without causing any disruptions or distortions in the visual presentation.",
