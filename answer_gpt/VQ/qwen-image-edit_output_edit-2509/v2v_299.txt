    "Question": "Q1: Does the airplane maintain its structural consistency despite being transformed into a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane is depicted as a stylized 3D cartoon character. It possesses exaggerated features typical of the chibi style, such as a rounded, oversized face and large eyes.

The chibi style focuses on cuteness and simplification, which can alter proportions but maintain the core aspects recognizably. Therefore, the structural consistency is maintained within the parameters of a stylized depiction.",
