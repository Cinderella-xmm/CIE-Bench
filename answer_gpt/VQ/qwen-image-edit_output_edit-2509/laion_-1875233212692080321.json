      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows a glass bottle with a base that seems appropriately aligned with where such base would commonly be located vis-a-vis the rose petals in a typical perfume bottle design. It does not appear disproportionately large or small compared to the bottle size and the cap. This is a common knowledge of how products are generally packaged for aesthetic appeal.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold rose-shaped cap in Image B has realistic reflections and specular highlights, indicating it has been rendered with consideration of the light source direction.
