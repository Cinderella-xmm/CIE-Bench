    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the notebook cover shows the title 'Tales Untold' rather than a typewriter. The initial analysis indicates that the keyboard layout and the coherent rectangular form reference a typewriter, but Image B is a notebook. Thus, identifying these aspects specifically regarding Image B is not applicable.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a notebook cover with the text 'Tales Untold' prominently placed, whereas there is no typewriter or keyboard area involved in the image. The text is positioned centrally on the notebook cover and follows a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation, but no comparison to a typewriter is possible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ink splatters are visible on the notebook cover, scattered irregularly across the surface with varying sizes and soft edges. They do not obscure any functional elements, as there is no presence of typewriter keys or paper in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals a notebook cover placed on a marble surface. The surface continues evenly without noticeable gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts, suggesting a consistent background under the base of the notebook.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the notebook's leather spine, showing a consistent texture with slight variations in color. The embossed icons are evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to create an impression of depth, consistent with common design aesthetics.",
