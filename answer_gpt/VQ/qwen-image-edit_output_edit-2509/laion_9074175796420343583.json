      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms drawn on the pie's surface are consistent with the coloring and texture of the crust. They are shaded appropriately to blend with the surface of the pie, without any visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading. The editing has smoothly integrated the arms with the pie crust's natural appearance.",

      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lattice pattern on the pie maintains its original grid structure and spacing. There are no signs of distortion, stretching, or lines that break, indicating that it was not altered to resemble a fabric apron. The lattice appears intact without any manipulation to turn it into fabric.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knife in Image B is converted into a feather pen. It has a quill tip and wooden shaft that seem to naturally transition from the original knife shape. The alteration maintains realism without abrupt changes or texture mismatches, ensuring a seamless conversion.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
