    "Question": "Q1: Do the shoes appear naturally larger without any visible distortion or unnatural stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear well-proportioned and maintain a natural shape relative to the legs and feet. This is determined by observing the even curvature of the shoes and the lack of any obvious elongation or disproportion that would suggest distortion. The visual representation is consistent with common depictions of sneakers, suggesting that the size and proportions are natural.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the positioning of the feet on the cloud-shaped shelf look natural and structurally sound, without any floating or disconnected appearance?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the feet are placed firmly on a circular platform that resembles a cloud, creating an illusion of standing on a solid, cloud-like structure. This positioning appears natural and structurally sound because the feet are flat on the surface without any evidence of floating or unnatural positioning. The consistent shadowing and perspective reinforce the solid connection between the feet and the platform.",
