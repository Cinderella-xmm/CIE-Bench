    "Question": "Q1: Are the road sections composed of clearly defined angular shapes that align logically with the perspective and curvature of the original road, without floating or misaligned fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the road is composed of angular shapes that follow the natural curve and perspective that one would expect from a road, without any fragments appearing to float or deviate from the logical flow of the pavement. The shapes contribute to a coherent portrayal of the road's path, maintaining visual consistency with how roads curve and align in perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the cloud formations consist of layered quadrilateral shapes that overlap in a way consistent with atmospheric depth, without abrupt edges or disconnected blocks?",
    "explanation": "The cloud formations in Image B are constructed using quadrilateral shapes that are layered to create a sense of depth characteristic of a real atmospheric scene. The shapes overlap in a way that suggests depth and continuity, and there are no sudden edges or disconnected blocks marring the shapes. This maintains a visual flow that is in line with natural cloud formation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the telegraph poles rendered as angular or geometric structures that maintain vertical alignment and proportional relationships between the pole and crossbars, without visible warping or structural collapse?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the telegraph poles are depicted using straight lines that suggest angular, geometric structures. They maintain their vertical alignment and the crossbars are proportional to the poles they are attached to, ensuring an appearance of stability and structural integrity without any visible warping or indications of collapse.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the tree canopies represented as solid triangular or pyramid-like shapes that sit naturally on the ground and do not float above the terrain or intersect with the road guardrails?",
    "explanation": "The tree canopies in Image B are shown as solid triangular shapes that are grounded naturally on the landscape. None of these shapes are elevated in a way that would imply they are floating, nor do they intersect awkwardly with the road guardrails, ensuring a grounded and coherent representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors across the road surface, sky, and surrounding vegetation uniformly distributed within the specified muted palette, without isolated bright spots, color bleeding, or textural noise?",
    "explanation": "The colors in Image B are applied consistently across the different elements such as the road, sky, and surrounding vegetation, adhering to a muted palette. There are no isolated bright spots or any evidence of color bleeding or textural noise, maintaining a visually coherent and aesthetically calm composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
