    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile on the tart are designed with smooth and rounded shapes, which are consistent with the friendly and animated theme of the image. The features are symmetrically placed and seamlessly integrated with the custard's color, maintaining a smooth texture without jagged edges. This suggests that the features were intentionally added as part of the illustration, maintaining visual coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the forest creatures are small figures placed on the tart's crust. Their proportions are suitable for a whimsical illustration, aligning nicely with the curvature of the crust. The textures of the creatures match the soft, cartoonish style of the environment, showing no signs of pixelation or clipping, indicating fine attention to detail in their integration into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the path swirls from the base of the tart into the background of the forest scene. The path maintains a consistent width and shading as it recedes, which aligns with the perspective to create depth. The curves are gentle, and the path is well-integrated with its surroundings, free of abrupt edges or segmentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tartâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green foliage and pastel flowers are scattered around the tart in Image B, strategically placed to enhance the whimsical forest atmosphere. The elements are sufficiently spaced from the tart, with no clipping or improper overlapping on the tart's surface. Shadows and highlights contribute to a cohesive integration with the tart and surrounding ground.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image focuses on a singular tart, unlike two tarts in the original. The tart in the edited image maintains the same basic form and layered structure as seen in the original image, including the crust, custard, and top glaze. The additions of the face and other design elements are non-destructive, and there are no noticeable distortions or missing layers, retaining the essence of the tart.",
