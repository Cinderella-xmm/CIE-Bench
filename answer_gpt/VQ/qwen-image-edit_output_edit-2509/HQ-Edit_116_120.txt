    "Question": "Q1: Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome encapsulating the sandcastle is visually smooth and transparent. There are no visible seams or distortions present, and the reflections on the dome appear consistent with a smooth glass surface. The sandcastle inside is clearly visible without any apparent refraction issues that would obscure its visibility. Referring to common knowledge on how a smooth, high-quality glass dome should appear, it would not introduce any unwanted distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
    "explanation": "The mahogany base in Image B exhibits a rich, natural wood texture with consistent detailing. It appears uniformly thick around its perimeter and provides stable support for the dome and enclosed sandcastle. Given its realistic appearance and symmetry, it is likely well-scaled to fit snugly with the size of the dome without any visible distortions or disproportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is covered with subtle glitter that is evenly distributed across its surface. This does not interfere with the visibility of the intricate architectural details such as towers, stairs, and arches. The reflective quality of the grains is consistent with the way sand can appear in reality, enhancing the texture without overwhelming or obscuring the sandcastle’s design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seashells around the sandcastle are rendered with fine detail, showcasing well-defined shapes and natural textures. They are proportionately sized relative to the sandcastle and do not exhibit pixelation or edge artifacts, ensuring a realistic appearance. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge of how seashells should look, imply that the representation is clear and accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
    "explanation": "The ceramic plaque in Image B is visibly attached to the base with the text “Empire of the Shores” clearly readable. The surface showcases a consistent matte pearl finish that does not reflect excessive light or cause texture mismatches. The attachment appears firm and proportionate, giving a coherent and aesthetically pleasing look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle and surrounding seashells are depicted with a matte pearl finish. The finish is consistent throughout, providing a subtle shine without any area showing excessive reflection that could detract from the uniform appearance. This consistent application ensures that intricate details remain visible and unaltered by reflective inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
    "explanation": "The sandcastle depicted in Image B maintains intact and consistent architectural features including towers, stairs, and arches. Visual inspection reveals no signs of stretching, bending, or missing pieces. The consistent and precise geometry reflects real-world architectural symmetry, affirming the structural integrity of the model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
