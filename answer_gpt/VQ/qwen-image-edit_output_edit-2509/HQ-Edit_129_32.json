      "question": "Does the velvet lining inside the box display a soft, matte texture with subtle pile variation and appropriate shadowing beneath the key, indicating realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet lining has a soft, matte texture that is typical for velvet fabrics. The texture is consistent with a material that would have pile variation, which is reflected in the subtle visual variation across the surface. Additionally, the shadows beneath the key are appropriately cast, consistent with how a key would sit on velvet, supporting the perception of realistic fabric behavior.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold scrollwork patterns on the lid continuous, symmetrical, and proportionally similar to the decorative elements on the key’s bow, without any jagged edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold scrollwork patterns are continuous and symmetrical. They echo the ornamental design of the key’s bow, using similar motifs and proportions. The edges of the scrollwork are smooth and well-defined, indicating no jagged edges or missing segments. These design elements convey a harmonious aesthetic between the box and the key, suggesting high design coherence.",

      "question": "Is the satin compartment visibly smooth with soft highlights and gentle folds, and does the key sit flush within it without gaps or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the satin compartment inside the box is depicted with a smooth surface texture, characterized by soft highlights indicative of satin material. The highlights and gentle folds give a realistic impression of how satin fabric would behave. The key appears to sit flush within the satin, with no visible gaps or indications that it is floating above the fabric, showing a realistic interaction between the object and the material.",

      "question": "Is the embossed text “Eternal Elegance” clearly legible, evenly raised, and rendered with a metallic luster that matches the gold tone and reflectivity of the key and scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Eternal Elegance' is clearly legible and appears to be evenly raised from the surface of the box lid. The text exhibits a metallic luster, consistent with the shiny and reflective quality of the gold tone seen on the key and the scrollwork surrounding the box. The coherence in metallic luster reinforces the sense of luxury and quality in the presentation.",
