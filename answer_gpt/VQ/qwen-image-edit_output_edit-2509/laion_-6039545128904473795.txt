    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central body of the figure does not show any facial features due to the blurred face. However, focusing on the rest of the body, it maintains an angular design with smooth textures that match the precision and sleekness expected in robotic constructions. There are no visible artifacts or shape distortions elsewhere, indicating a consistent design with the angular nature of mechanical parts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents rotor blade arms that are proportionally consistent with the rest of the robotic structure, offering smooth transitions at the joints that indicate potential rotational functionality. The absence of any visible warping or breakage suggests these elements are designed with operational integrity in mind.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spider-like legs do not appear to connect directly to landing gear locations but are integrated into the humanoid robotic design, offering a transformation from the original concept. There are coherent joint structures visible, providing a seamless connection without gaps or floating segments, as expected in advanced robotics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the drone with lighting that is consistent with the futuristic cityscape. The metallic reflections on the body are appropriately illuminated, matching the ambient effects of the city background. The transition between the drone and the environment is smooth, without any harsh or disruptive contrasts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?",
    "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B is positioned strategically near the robotic figure's face area, ensuring it is clear and legible. There is no overlap with the drone components or the background, maintaining visual clarity and enabling the message to be effectively communicated without obstruction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
