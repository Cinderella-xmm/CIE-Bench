      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the incorporation of cogwheels within the hair creates a steampunk aesthetic. Observing how these cogwheels are embedded in the hair, it appears that they blend smoothly into the hairline maintaining the original continuity of the head's shape. The scalp surface is uninterrupted, indicating a successful integration of these elements without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic fabric folds seem to naturally continue over the shoulders and chest, simulating a series of overlapping metal plates or strips. The positioning of rivets and tubes appears strategically applied at joints or transition points, lending to a sense of physical durability and function, without unnecessary distortion or displacement in the fabric representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the watch parts and gears in Image B suggests deliberate placement, as they are positioned symmetrically and firmly around the base of the bust. The absence of overlapping or floating elements supports the idea that the components are secured in a manner consistent with physical reality, contributing to a stable appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocle appears integrated into the sculpture in a way that it rests flush with the surroundings of the eye socket. The mechanical joints attaching to the face are visible but do not disrupt the sculptural form or anatomical accuracy of the facial bones, preserving the structureâ€™s integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a consistent use of bronze and copper tones, these colors are applied evenly across all altered components, enhancing the steampunk theme. Variations in tone are present where expected due to lighting or material shape, ensuring reflections appear realistic. Abrupt color changes or non-metallic appearances are absent, ensuring overall visual coherence.",
