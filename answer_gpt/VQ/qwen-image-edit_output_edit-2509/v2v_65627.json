      "question": "Does the soft grey plush texture on the elephant's body appear natural and free of any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is constructed from what appears to be Lego-like bricks, thus the texture of its body is inherently blocky and structured rather than plush. The blocks are consistent and there are no apparent visual artifacts such as color mismatches or disjointed components that would disrupt the overall sculptural look of the elephant. Therefore, given the context of the Lego construct, the texture is consistent with the expected appearance of such a toy.",

      "question": "Are the large velvety pink inner ears of the elephant structurally consistent and visually credible without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elephant's ears made of pink and grey Lego-like pieces, forming the shape of large ears. The blocks are evenly placed, and there are no visible misalignments or rotations that would suggest distortion. The ear structures are coherent with the aesthetic of block construction and appear sturdy without any deviation from their intended form.",

      "question": "Does the jaunty small yellow felt hat blend naturally with the elephant and retain its fine details without any loss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant features a yellow hat that is composed of blocky Lego parts like the rest of the figure in Image B. The hat stands upright, maintaining its intended curved and pointed shape. The consistent coloring and edge precision of each block slot into the overall figureâ€™s design without discrepancies, making it blend naturally with the entire composition of the Lego elephant.",

      "question": "Is the bright red and yellow ruffled collar visually plausible and free of any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red and yellow collar is constructed from small, specific blocks that simulate a ruffled effect. In Image B, the collar is consistent with the visible Lego motif, appearing as a carefully arranged sequence of blocks. There are no errant shapes or unexpected coloring that suggest unnatural textures. This maintains the aesthetic integrity and plausibility of being part of a Lego construct.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the warm, soft spotlight and the weathered wooden stage enhance the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the image without causing any disruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop is enhanced by a spotlight that casts a warm glow onto a textured wooden stage, framed by a star-speckled blue curtain. The lighting effectively contrasts the stage against the vivid color of the curtains, emphasizing the elephant figure under a theatrical spotlight. The wooden stage and lighting appear coherent with the setting and contribute to the theme without introducing conflicting textures or tones.",
