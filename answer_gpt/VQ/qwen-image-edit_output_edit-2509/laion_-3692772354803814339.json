      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle smooth, continuous, and free of jagged edges or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle appear smooth, continuous, and without jagged edges or unnatural distortions. This is deduced from the visual observation of the fluidity and uninterrupted flow of the wave lines, which suggest a well-executed design without sharp interruptions or distortions typically associated with lower image quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label occupy the correct area, maintain sharp edges, and show no signs of pixelation or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden maritime symbols on the bottle label in Image B appear correctly positioned and maintain sharp edges, indicating clarity and precision in their placement. The absence of pixelation or smudging suggests high image quality where the edges of the symbols are distinctly defined and not blurred or blended with the surrounding area, which reflects a well-rendered artistic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the compass rose at the top of the packaging have evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections and no misalignment or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass rose has evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections, as observed from the balanced symmetry and uniform distribution of the compass directions. There are no signs of misalignment or clipping artifacts, indicating an accurately designed element with attention to detail. This suggests that the metallic properties and lighting are effectively portrayed, maintaining the intended design consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body seamless, with no abrupt breaks or geometric deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body in Image B is seamless, as visually assessed by the smooth, continuous connection that lacks any abrupt breaks or deformations. This observation supports the conclusion of a cohesive design where the elements integrate naturally without disruption, contributing to the overall fluid appearance of the bottle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parchment surface of the packaging display consistent aging texture without artificial streaks or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment surface in Image B presents a consistent aging texture, characterized by a uniform appearance and absence of artificial-looking streaks or uneven shading. The visual assessment of its texture suggests it replicates a naturally aged surface effectively, without introducing unrealistic or synthetic artifacts that would detract from its authenticity.",
