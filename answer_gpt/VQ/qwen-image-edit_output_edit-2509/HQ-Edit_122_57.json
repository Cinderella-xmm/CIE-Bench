      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the crystal vase depicts a geometric form with clear faceted surfaces. It does not follow the original proportions and shape of the ceramic vase from Image A, which features ornate designs and a bulbous form with decorative elements. The crystal vase is more symmetrical with distinct geometric facets, indicating a change rather than a retention of the original shape and proportions, and does not possess the ornamental ceramic style of Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract floral patterns appear etched with clarity into the crystal surfaces of the vase. They are sharply defined and consistent in depth, suggesting they are integral to the vaseâ€™s design rather than superimposed or blurred. This differs from Image A, where the designs are painted as part of the larger ornate ceramic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the crystal flowers exhibit pastel coloration and are crafted to display internal refraction, which gives them a translucent appearance. They do not directly retain the recognizable shapes of the diverse blooms from Image A, where natural flowers are evident. Image B focuses on a stylized representation with varied pastel colors, contrasting the solid, opaque nature of natural blooms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the crystal vase seated on a pedestal that has mirrored qualities. The pedestal is flat and captures the reflection of the vase and flowers clearly, without distortion. This suggests a modern, reflective surface that does not warp or alter the reflected images, which is consistent with the qualities observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting interacts with the crystal elements to produce a realistic refraction and internal glow. The highlights on the crystal flowers and vase appear soft, avoiding harsh bright spots or flat shading. This creates a luminous effect that accentuates the translucent qualities of the crystal, which is enhanced by the gentle coloration of the flowers.",
