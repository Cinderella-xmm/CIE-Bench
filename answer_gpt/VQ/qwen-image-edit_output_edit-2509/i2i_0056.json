      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D cartoon character stand naturally at the center of the image without visible distortions in its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D cartoon character is placed prominently at the center. Its body appears proportionate, with no visible distortions. The limbs, body, and head are consistent with typical chibi design, which features an exaggerated head size compared to the body. This suggests that the proportions are natural within the context of the art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and materials of the chibi character's hard hat, shirt, and vest consistent with the original imageâ€™s description and appear natural in the 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character wears a yellow hard hat, a bright green shirt, and an orange vest. These colors are vivid and clearly defined, making them consistent with typical safety attire in construction contexts. The materials appear smooth, which is appropriate for a chibi 3D style where realistic textures might be simplified. Thus, they appear natural within the 3D environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition between the chibi character and the low-poly construction scene lack noticeable artifacts and unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B presents a 3D environment where the character is placed in front of simple, low-poly models of a pile of construction material and a small digger. These elements integrate well without visible seams or artifacts, maintaining consistency in style throughout. The textures are simplistic, which aligns with the chibi and low-poly aesthetic, ensuring naturalness in the transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background in the edited image a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model, and is it devoid of elements from the original beach scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a simplified environment with a light gray background, typical of minimalistic 3D scenes. It includes construction elements like a small crane, deviating entirely from the beach scenery in Image A, which had a horse and water body. This significant change indicates a complete replacement of the backdrop, fulfilling the description of being devoid of original elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a 1:1 composition ratio with the chibi character properly centered and proportionate within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition appears balanced, with the chibi character centrally positioned, giving a sense of an even distribution within the frame. The 1:1 aspect ratio means all elements, including the character and background elements, are proportionately scaled, yielding a well-composed image.",
