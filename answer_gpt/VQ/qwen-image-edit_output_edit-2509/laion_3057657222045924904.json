      "question": "Does the transparent acrylic display case show no visible distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that affect the appearance of the McLaren?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent acrylic display case surrounding the McLaren features clear walls that allow the car to be viewed without noticeable distortion or anomalies. This suggests that the case has high optical clarity, typically associated with high-quality acrylic materials. Given this analysis and the usual design of such display cases, it can be concluded that there are no visible issues affecting the appearance of the McLaren.",

      "question": "Is the polished chrome base aligned with the car's position and does it reflect light and surroundings naturally without appearing disconnected or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the polished chrome base appears to be properly aligned with the car's position, with reflections indicating a realistic interaction with the lighting and surroundings. This suggests that the base follows the natural physical principles of light reflection, and there is no indication of discontinuity or distortion, meaning the chrome base effectively integrates with the depicted scene.",

      "question": "Are the carbon fiber textures confined to the interior walls of the display case and do they exhibit consistent, non-repeating patterns without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the interior of the display case is lined with carbon fiber textures which are typically even and non-repeating, indicating a high-quality finish. There are no apparent artifacts or irregularities in the pattern, which suggests a uniform application that is confined to the interior backdrop of the case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature wrenches and screwdrivers proportionally accurate compared to the McLaren and positioned in a way that suggests intentional placement without floating or clipping through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools are positioned on the base around the McLaren model. They are proportionally sized to suggest they are miniature tools suited for a model car display. The tools appear to be placed deliberately on the display base without any indication of floating or clipping, implying a realistic and intentional setup.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the laser-etched cityscape silhouette positioned at a consistent depth behind the car and display case, with no overlapping or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laser-etched cityscape in Image B is designed to be a backdrop to the display case, and it appears to maintain a consistent depth relative to the car without any overlapping with the vehicle or the case itself. The backdrop is positioned to give a depth perspective, simulating a distant skyline without any visual clipping issues.",
