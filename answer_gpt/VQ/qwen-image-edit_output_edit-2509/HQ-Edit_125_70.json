      "question": "Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the hammer handle appears to be smoothly integrated. The color of the logo matches well with the natural wood tone of the handle, and there are no visible texture mismatches or jagged edges. The logo appears aligned with the grain and texture of the handle, suggesting a natural continuation rather than a pasted element. A comparison with Image A, if needed, would further confirm there is nothing unnatural about the edit by missing the logo.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the letters on the wood shavings appear to follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving accurately. They seem to wrap around the shavings with a consistent and natural alignment, showing no signs of being flattened or stretched. They do not appear to float above the surface but rather blend with the shavings as if engraved or written directly onto them. Based on this visual analysis, the integration looks seamless.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rustic banner at the top of Image B aligns well with the overall lighting and shadowing of the scene. The texture of the banner looks like aged wood, with grainy details and natural tonal variations that one would expect from a wooden surface. These characteristics suggest it's not digitally pasted but integrated carefully to blend with the image's ambiance and elements.",

      "question": "Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the copper accents are present among primarily grayscale tones on the pegboard. They appear to be evenly lit and harmonized with the surrounding shades, without creating any abrupt or unrealistic reflections. The integration respects the natural lighting conditions, maintaining consistent tonality and avoiding jarring contrasts with the grayscale elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The business card in Image B seems to be positioned correctly in perspective and scale, relative to the tools and elements on the workbench. It doesn't appear disproportionate or oddly placed in the scene. A subtle shadow beneath the card matches the ambient light source, ensuring the card's integration into the scene looks realistic and believable.",
