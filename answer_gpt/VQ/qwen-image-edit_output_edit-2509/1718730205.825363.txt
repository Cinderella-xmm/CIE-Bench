    "Question": "Q1: Are the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex continuous, following the curve without gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks?",
    "explanation": "The image has a stained glass appearance where leadwork outlines separate different segments of the spiral vortex. Observing the spiral, the leadwork appears to follow the curve smoothly, maintaining continuity without any visible gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks. The design is typical of stained glass art, where lead lines should form clean separations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the jewel-toned colors applied to the sky and tree canopies transition smoothly without visible color banding or unnatural patches?",
    "explanation": "In examining the image's sky and tree canopies, the colors are vibrant, typical of stained glass art. The transition from one hue to another is smooth, without noticeable banding or unnatural patches. This smooth transition of colors is a hallmark of high-quality stained glass art, highlighting attention to detail in color grading.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the faceted glass textures applied uniformly across the spiral and trees, showing clear refraction effects without blurring or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The faceted glass textures across the spiral and trees show a consistent level of detailing. The refraction effects seem clear and maintain visual sharpness without blurring or loss of detail. Typically, well-crafted stained glass maintains uniform textures and clear refraction, which is apparent here.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Do the leadwork lines form clean, unbroken borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without intersecting incorrectly or creating floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The leadwork lines in the stained glass image create clean and unbroken borders around distinct elements such as the spiral, trees, and horizon. They do not intersect incorrectly, nor do they create any floating segments. Stained glass art demands precision in leadwork to maintain the integrity of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface still distinguishable and not obscured by the glass texture or color saturation?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection, individual stars in the spiral and reflections on the water surface retain their distinguishable features despite the glass texture and color saturation. The stained glass effect enhances the visual distinction without obscuring these delicate details, indicative of high-quality stained glass work.",
    "answer": "Yes"
