      "question": "Does the chibi version of the woman have a proportionally enlarged head relative to the body, with limbs and torso scaled down appropriately without deformed joints or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi depiction of the woman showcases an exaggerated head size, which is a common characteristic of chibi art style.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the oversized frills on the gown rendered with curved, layered shapes that suggest fabric volume, and do they avoid flat, rigid edges or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the woman's gown with large, curved frills, characteristic of a layered appearance which indicates fabric volume. In chibi art, maintaining the sense of depth and flow in clothing helps in rendering exaggerated cartoon-like features. These frills are not flat or rigid, hence displaying a natural flow without any sign of unnatural stretching or distortion.",

      ],
