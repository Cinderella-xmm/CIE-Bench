      "question": "Are the added gears and copper accents seamlessly integrated into the silver surface of the teapot without visible texture inconsistencies or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot features copper accents that are visually distinct in color compared to the silver areas. These accents include gears and rims. Upon examining the image, the transition between different materials appears smooth, and no abrupt edges or surface inconsistencies are visible. The copper seamlessly follows the intricate patterns and curves of the teapot, suggesting a harmonious integration with the silver surface. World knowledge tells us that metals like copper and silver can be alloyed or placed together in design without automatic inconsistency. Therefore, the visual integration seems to apply to unified crafting techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome appear transparent and smoothly contoured without geometric distortions or artificial edges that break the illusion of a real glass enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is largely effective in maintaining transparency, showing the teapot inside with clarity. The reflection and refraction properties of the glass appear consistent with what is expected from a real glass dome. There are smooth transitions in its curvature, and no obvious geometric distortions or artificial edges are apparent that would detract from the realism of the glass enclosure. These qualities contribute to a convincing visual representation of glass.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden floorboards and scattered tea leaves rendered with realistic textures and proportions, and do the tiny silver utensils appear appropriately scaled and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden floorboards beneath the teapot are illustrated with realistic grain and texture, effectively mimicking the appearance of real wood. The scattered tea leaves possess diverse shapes that add authenticity through randomness. The silver utensils, such as spoons, are intricately detailed, clearly visible, and proportionally correct relative to their environment and the teapot, enhancing the realism of the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the moss accents naturally distributed along the base edge, with soft, organic texture and no signs of unnatural clustering or color mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss in Image B is placed along the base of the teapot's platform with attention to a natural distribution pattern, avoiding dense clustering that would seem artificial. The color is consistent with typical moss, exhibiting gradients common in organic materials. The texture appears soft and complex, betraying no signs of stark digital artifacts that might indicate poor rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam effect emerging from the elephant's trunk appear as a smooth, translucent vapor with natural diffusion and no jagged edges or artificial glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam is rendered as rising vapor, characterized by its smooth, diffusing edges suggestive of a natural flow. The transparency and transition from the trunk to the air are subtle, with no glaring edges or pixelation that might make the steam seem less realistic. Thereâ€™s also no artificial glow, which contributes to the impression of genuine steam.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the vine-like metalwork elements consistently shaped and positioned around the dome, following natural curvatures without intersecting the glass unnaturally or creating inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine-like elements in Image B wrap around the dome with clear attention to flowing curves and patterns typical of such decorative metalwork. They maintain their place, not breaching the glass dome in an unnatural or illogical manner, and their shadows appear consistent with the lighting in the scene. Their presence as artfully curled extensions further adheres to a naturalistic and consistent design.",
