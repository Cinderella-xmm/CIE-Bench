    "Question": "Q1: Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the character on the keychain has been designed with proportions typical of chibi figures, where the head is larger relative to the body. This enlargement is a common design choice to achieve a cute and stylized aesthetic. The head appears consistent with the neck and shoulders, maintaining a harmonious transition between these parts, which suggests that despite its large size, it is geometrically consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?",
    "explanation": "The keychain is designed as a soft rubber representation, typical in such merchandise items. The surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly exhibit a matte finish consistent with rubber material. There are no glossy reflections or inconsistent textures observed, which indicates the rendering is uniform across these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?",
    "explanation": "The keychain preserves fundamental design aspects of the red boots, including visible buckles and general shape. However, due to the simplification typical in such designs, fine details such as detailed stitching or intricate knit patterns are not as pronounced; they may be suggested rather than explicitly detailed. Therefore, these elements are identifiable but with less emphasis on finer structural detail.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The posture in the keychain design reflects a bending position consistent with the typical anatomy of chibi-style figures. The alignment of the spine, hips, and knees appears naturally cohesive, avoiding any unnatural angles or floating body segments. This suggests a simplification in the posture while preserving anatomical coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?",
    "explanation": "The silver keyring is securely attached to the top of the character, showing no visible gaps or overlapping edges, which indicates a well-executed connection. The wooden plank beneath the keychain exhibits a consistent texture typical of wood grain, with regular spacing and texture that does not disrupt the visual consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
