      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings and body aligned with the original gemstone positions and do they display consistent thread density and color without visible breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly shows embroidered patterns on its wings and body featuring gold thread and embellishments. Given world knowledge of embroidery, good craftsmanship results in consistent thread density and color. The patterns appear intact without breaks or misalignments, showcasing a well-executed design. Comparing to Image A, where the wings are adorned with gemstones giving sparkle and varied texture, the embroidery in Image B achieves alignment with the original positions of features like gemstones, albeit with a different medium.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly’s body and frame appear made of soft fabric with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges, and does it show natural fabric folds or drape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the butterfly's body and frame as constructed from a soft, cushioned fabric visibly devoid of metallic sheen. World knowledge suggests fabric doesn't shine like metal; thus, the visibility of folds and a plush texture in Image B indicates a fabric medium. This contrasts with Image A, where the butterfly is encased in a metallic frame with polished surfaces producing a reflective effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing surfaces exhibit a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance consistent with velvet, with no shiny spots or reflections resembling gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing surfaces exhibit a consistent matte finish typical of velvet fabrics, known for their soft texture and lack of bright reflectivity. Velvet generally does not shine like gemstones, as seen in Image A, where the butterfly's wings reflect light due to gemstone embellishments, thereby showing significant differences in texture and material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fluffy trim along the wing edges evenly distributed, soft, and attached in a way that follows the wing’s natural curve without appearing detached or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fluffy trim is uniformly aligned along the wing edges, depicting uniform distribution and softness. Those visual cues, combined with the knowledge of plush fabric behavior, suggest that the trim is meant to enhance softness and follows the butterfly's natural contours harmoniously. Image A lacks any trim, with gemstones lining the edges, which contrasts how such embellishments affect the visual perception of curves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the butterfly’s wings symmetrically shaped, the body proportionate to the wings, and the antennae correctly positioned and curved, with no visible warping or scaling errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly, in Image B, displays symmetrical wings and a body, supported by well-curved antennae contributing to its balance within world knowledge of symmetry in nature. Such precision eliminates warping or scaling errors. Image A’s butterfly similarly maintains symmetry with equal wing dimensions and proportionate body, showcasing consistency in artistic rendition across materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the butterfly resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion with a natural shadow underneath, indicating proper contact and physical grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly rests atop a pearl-white cushion which appears smooth and uniform in texture and color. It adheres to world knowledge about shadows as natural indicators of grounding; the shadow beneath supports a realistic contact representation. Image A’s butterfly does not rest on any cushion but its stable position on foliage suggests differing contexts of grounding.",
