    "Question": "Q1: Does the packaging box maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor, especially in alignment with the base and handle, without any distorted edges or warped geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box depicted has a realistic, well-proportioned view relative to the food processor displayed on it. The edges and geometry of the box, as well as the alignment with the actual representation of the appliance, are consistent and neither appear stretched nor compressed. There are no visible distortions or warping in the geometry, indicating a well-maintained proportion in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the 'Waring' brand name clearly visible and properly aligned on the packaging without overlapping or distorting adjacent elements such as the appliance illustration or background?",
    "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the 'Waring' brand name is prominently displayed on the packaging. It appears clean, clear, and well-aligned on the box, with no overlapping onto the appliance illustration or any distortions seen on the background. The brand name stands out effectively without interfering with other design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the isometric illustration of the food processor on the box accurately reflect the original object's geometry, including the feed tube, lid, and base, without distortion or incorrect angles?",
    "explanation": "The isometric illustration of the food processor on the box in Image B is consistent with the actual object's geometry seen in Image A. The elements like the feed tube, lid, and base are depicted without any noticeable distortion or erroneous angles. This alignment suggests careful representation true to the original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the exploded components of the food processor depicted with accurate shapes and positions, maintaining their original form and material texture without stretching or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the exploded view components of the food processor are illustrated correctly, showing clear, definitive shapes and positions. They maintain the original form and material textures accurately, with no signs of stretching, mishandling, or blurring visible. The depiction appears precise and true to the actual parts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging display natural material finishes without unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the packaging's metallic silver and matte black surfaces confer a realistic finish. There are natural reflections characteristic of metallic and matte textures, and no presence of unnatural reflections, excessive graininess, or any texture artifacts. The material finishes are consistently rendered, grounding a real-world authenticity in appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
