      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy crown appears digitally rendered and is centered relative to the sleek, futuristic design of the tower's central axis, supported by the cybernetic design integration of the tower. The lighting from the crown is consistent and uniform with no noticeable artifacts affecting its appearance, which indicates a smooth and deliberate alignment and rendering process.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girders have been transformed to resemble a futuristic structure that maintains a coherent design aesthetic simulating structural integrity. Despite the design alterations, the edges and lines appear straight and undamaged, signifying no bending or disconnection of segments.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, luminescent circuits visually integrate with the tower's futuristic surface, appear to be securely affixed, and follow the curvature without levitating. The light emitted from these circuits has a consistent and harmonious integration with the overall illumination environment, indicating skillful digital editing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of digital glyphs is harmoniously aligned with the futuristic aesthetic, maintaining a layer that respects the surface structure, and avoiding any impression of physical distortion. The embedding shows no visual conflict with the metal foundation, suggesting an expert overlay process.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, holographic components establish a sense of depth with layered visual elements, creating an impression of modern translucency. The delineation of these holographic aspects circumvents interaction with physical tower sectors and avoids pixelation, showcasing precision in digital crafting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, pixelated energy barriers are strategically set around the base, featuring crisp edge clarity and a congruent ground adjacency without floating or blurring effects. This positioning signifies advanced digital editing skills in maintaining precise and comprehensive boundaries.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, digital eyes are seamlessly incorporated in an architecture-friendly setup, radiating light with gentle shadow projection and environmental reflection while remaining visually unobtrusive. This effect results from an adept integration of digital renderings alongside the central design motif.",
