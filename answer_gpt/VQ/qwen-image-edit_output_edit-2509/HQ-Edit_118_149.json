      "question": "Are the pastel-colored areas of the dancer's leotard and tights smoothly blended without visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's leotard and tights are represented with pastel colors that appear to blend seamlessly. The leotard and tights have clean color transitions without any noticeable breaks or irregular patches, indicating smooth blending. The use of soft, pastel colors is typical in such artistic representations, suggesting careful design to achieve a harmonious appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the detachable sections around the dancer’s leg maintain consistent thickness and alignment with the leg’s natural curvature, avoiding floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the detachable sections around the dancer's leg are stylized with angular shapes that mimic the curvature of the leg. They are aligned well along the leg, creating a visual flow that suggests they are part of the figure rather than floating or misaligned. This indicates that the sections have consistent thickness and alignment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's limbs show angular transformations through stylized design elements. Despite these transformations, the limbs still maintain correct anatomical relationships, with joints appearing plausible and in line with typical human anatomy. The bends and extensions are artistic but do not over-exaggerate physical possibilities, keeping them within plausible limits.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures cleanly integrated onto the journal surface, with shadows and lighting matching the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sticker figures are placed on a journal surface, and the edges are cleanly integrated with the environment. The lighting appears consistent, reflecting the surface characteristics of the journal. Shadows are appropriately cast and do not disrupt the visual coherence between the stickers and the background, indicating a successful integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dancer’s hands retain five fingers each, with natural spacing and proportions, and no fused or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the representation is simplified due to the stylized nature of the stickers, which makes it difficult to distinguish individual fingers clearly. However, the design follows typical anatomical proportions, suggesting adherence to the general concept of five fingers with natural spacing, without any signs of fused or extra digits.",
