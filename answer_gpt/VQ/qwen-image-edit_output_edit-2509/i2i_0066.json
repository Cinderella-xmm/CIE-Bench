    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the 3D printed display model and display plaque appear naturally integrated into the image, without disrupting the sceneâ€™s overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D printed model of the flowers in the vase and the display plaque appear naturally integrated. The lighting on the model corresponds with the surrounding expo environment, and the shadows on the base are consistent with what would be expected in a real-world setting, maintaining the scene's overall authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the texture of the 3D printed model resemble matte PLA plastic realistically, without showing any unnatural surface irregularities or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vase has a smooth, matte finish consistent with a 3D printed object from PLA plastic. The surface of the vase does not show noticeable irregularities or artifacts, maintaining a realistic representation of this material.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the display plaque at the base positioned correctly, maintaining structural consistency and contributing to the visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display plaque is positioned accurately at the base of the model. It aligns well with the table and maintains structural consistency in relation to the model and the background, contributing to the visual credibility of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements and the new tech expo booth background appear seamless, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural segmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of the tech expo booth appears well integrated with the foreground elements such as the 3D model and the display stand. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural edges indicating segmentation, which helps in creating a seamless image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the 3D printed model and the display plaque realistic and consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario, avoiding any noticeable distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the 3D printed model and the display plaque are realistic, showing consistency with expected real-world dimensions. There are no noticeable distortions, indicating careful attention to scale and sizing in the integration process.",
