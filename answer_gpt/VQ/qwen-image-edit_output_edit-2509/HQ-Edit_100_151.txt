    "Question": "Q5: Is the calendar grid positioned at ground level and aligned with the path beneath the child, without floating or casting unrealistic shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid is visibly superimposed at the bottom of the image and does not correspond with any elements at ground level. It appears more as an overlay rather than an element being part of the scene's ground, thus it does not align with the path beneath the child in a three-dimensional sense and does not cast shadows.",
    "answer": "No"
