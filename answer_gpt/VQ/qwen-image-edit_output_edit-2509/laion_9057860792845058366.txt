    "Question": "Q1: Are the reflections on the robot’s body uniform and physically consistent with a metallic surface, without streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlight areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot’s body exhibits reflections characteristic of a metallic surface, displaying a uniform, smooth appearance without visible streaks or over-saturation. The highlights are evenly distributed across the surface, consistent with how light would naturally interact with metallic materials. This visual smoothness and cohesion demonstrate an accurate depiction of metallic reflections.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the holographic display on the chest transparent and layered above the surface without warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates?",
    "explanation": "The holographic display in Image B appears to be effectively transparent, allowing the underlying details of the robot to be visible and maintaining its position above the surface of the chest. There is no noticeable warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates, as the display floats clearly beyond the robot’s physical structure, complying with a reasonable layering effect typical of such technology.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the control icons in the digital interface overlay sharp, readable, and positioned without overlapping key mechanical components such as the shoulders or torso joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the control icons within the digital interface overlay are crisp, clearly defined, and readable. Their positioning seems intentional and careful, avoiding overlap with crucial mechanical areas such as shoulders or torso joints, which aids in maintaining clarity and prevents visual interference with the mechanical design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm without bending or deforming the arm’s structure, and does it have a clean, seamless connection point consistent with magnetic attachment?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the smartwatch accessory is attached to the robot's forearm securely, maintaining the integrity of the arm’s structure without any visible bending or deformation. The connection point between the smartwatch and the forearm is smooth and well-aligned, implying a seamless, possibly magnetic attachment as no awkward seams or visible attachments are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the floating tech interface symbols in the background evenly spaced, sharp-edged, and free from jagged outlines or ghosting effects?",
    "explanation": "The floating tech symbols in the background of Image B appear evenly distributed and maintain a consistent sharpness. The edges are well-defined without any jagged outlines or ghosting effects, indicating a clean and professional design execution for these digital elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
