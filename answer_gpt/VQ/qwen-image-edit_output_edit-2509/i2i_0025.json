      "question": "Does the womanâ€™s face exhibit natural contours and shading without visible unnatural textures or blotches in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect has been applied to the woman's face. In a watercolor style, natural contours and shading should appear soft and blended, with subtle transitions between light and dark areas. Upon observation, the general watercolor transformation has attempted to smooth out textures and transitions. However, the contours are not visible due to the blur, which does not allow for proper evaluation in this regard.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background figures have been transformed with a watercolor effect. This typically involves simplifying shapes and using light washes of color. The figures are represented with soft lines and gentle color transitions, showing smooth and continuous outlines without any awkward geometric breaks or inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's hand is visible holding a wine glass. The fingers appear to be naturally curved and spaced, with all five fingers present. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural shapes in the hand's structure due to the watercolor transformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wine glass in Image B maintains a level of transparency typical of real life, with subtle reflections that are consistent with its properties. The watercolor effect does not overly stylize or obscure the fine details and transparency of the glass, maintaining a realistic appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect should maintain consistent lighting and spatial interactions between objects. The shadows and positions of the woman, her wine glass, and the table appear coherent, without any distortion or floating effects, indicating that the watercolor style was successfully applied without disrupting the natural scene setup.",
