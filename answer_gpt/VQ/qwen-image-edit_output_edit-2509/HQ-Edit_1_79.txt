    "Question": "Q5: Are the three panels aligned horizontally across the image, with consistent size and spacing, and do they sit within the frame without overlapping or distorting the original subject or background elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the three panels are horizontally aligned, exhibiting consistent size and spacing. Each panel uniformly occupies its designated space without overlap or distortion, keeping the subject and surrounding environments intact. The alignment ensures a balanced layout that respects the framing and subject composition.",
