    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the elongated body retain smooth, continuous curvature along the side and rear panels without sharp edges or unnatural bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object appears to be a boat-like structure with a streamlined and curved design. The smoothness and continuous curvature are maintained without any visible sharp edges or protrusions. The design is likely intended to mimic the sleek nature of luxury vehicles and yachts, adhering to modern automotive or marine design aesthetics known for fluid forms and absence of abrupt features. This understanding is based on common design principles for aerodynamics and aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glass bases at the wheel positions transparent with visible internal texture, evenly shaped, and grounded flush with the platform without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the wheels would typically be on a vehicle, there is instead a circular glass or crystal-like structure at the base of the boat. This base appears to have a textured, transparent quality indicative of a glass material, and it seems integrated into the platform evenly without any signs of floating or distortion. The realistic rendering and alignment suggest the design integrates seamlessly with the base, typical of well-executed graphic models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silver cap centered on the roof area, with clean edges and reflective surface that matches the surrounding chrome elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central structure of the boat in Image B features a prominent silver cap, which appears centered on the roof. With clean, smooth edges and a reflective surface, it aligns with the finish seen in luxury metal detailing. Its shiny, chrome-like appearance is consistent with the rest of the modelâ€™s reflective elements, creating a cohesive visual design. This is supported by the consistent visual harmonization commonly observed in luxury object design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed text along the side panel clearly legible, aligned with the body's curvature, and rendered with subtle depth and shadow to match the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the side of the boat in Image B, the text 'RENTLEY' is clearly visible. It follows the curve of the body, appearing to adhere to the visual flow and contours. This text is rendered in a manner that allows it to be legible and suggests depth, consistent with how embossed or engraved text appears on metal or polished surfaces. The addition of depth and subtle shadow gives it an authentic three-dimensional appearance, aligning with recognized techniques for creating realistic text effects on a physical model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns flow continuously across the surface without repeating tiles, jagged edges, or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wave patterns on the side of the boat in Image B appear to move fluidly across the surface. There are no visible interruptions, and the pattern is smooth and continuous. This design choice is indicative of a singular graphic meant to mimic natural waves, avoiding issues like repeated tiling or mismatched segments. Additionally, the lighting on the patterns appears coherent with the rest of the model, maintaining a consistent appearance without abrupt changes in lighting or shadow that do not correspond with the object's orientation or light source.",
