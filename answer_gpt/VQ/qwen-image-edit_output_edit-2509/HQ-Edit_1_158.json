      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the silhouette of the woman is depicted in a seated position with arms holding a book. The image is a digital illustration emphasizing simplicity and design, and generally, the anatomy appears proportionate. There are no evident geometric distortions like misaligned limbs. The style is more abstract which can slightly deviate from exact anatomical precision but remains coherent within its artistic framework.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the womanâ€™s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is consistently drawn as a central focus, proportionally sized to fit the hands and arms of the silhouette without any visual indicators of floating or clipping through the chair or body. This is characteristic of a clean illustration style, maintaining spatial coherence.",

      "question": "Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a stylized pattern to represent clothing with intricate detailing, maintaining a coherent integration with the rest of the silhouette. The abstracted lace design effectively aligns with the artistic direction of the edited image, showing no signs of inconsistency or unnatural repetition that would disrupt the visual flow.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B displays a stylized bookshelf with organized rows and a uniform structure. Books are represented by a consistent line pattern, maintaining realistic spacing and alignment, fitting well into the overall design aesthetic of a symmetrical, orderly library setting.",
