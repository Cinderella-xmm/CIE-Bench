      "question": "Does the man's face maintain natural proportions and avoid distortion after being converted into a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition of the man's face into a 3D cartoon style generally retains proportions consistent with typical cartoon portrayals, which often exaggerate certain features for stylistic purposes. However, since the face is blurred, it is not possible to assess if specific distortions are present. Nonetheless, the style conversion maintains cartoon norms consistent with common character design without obvious distortion.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's hand holding the fan has been converted into 3D cartoon style, which often simplifies texture details to fit the style. Observing the hand, it maintains consistent proportions and smooth surfaces typical of 3D cartoon portrayals, without obvious visual artifacts or distortions.",
