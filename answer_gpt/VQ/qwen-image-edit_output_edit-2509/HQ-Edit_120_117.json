      "question": "Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the globe is depicted with a shiny, spherical surface that shows reflections, indicating a smooth and uniformly curved exterior. The absence of jagged edges, and the reflections consistent with a spherical shape, suggest it is manufactured with precision. The smooth curvature is typical of glass or acrylic objects like snow globes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lighthouse within the globe displaying structural characteristics such as window placements and symmetrical design. Upon examining the image, it appears that these features mirror the original lighthouse design depicted in Image A, though scaled down to fit within the globe. The consistent arrangement and symmetry indicate careful modeling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves within the globe have a smooth appearance and a translucent blue color. The light reflections and flow indications on the surface suggest a continuous resin-like texture. This smoothness and uniformity are without evidence of blocky or fragmented textures, typical of resin objects molded to imply motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base of the globe in Image B appears solid and flat beneath the globe, providing support. There is visible wood grain and engraved lines forming a radial pattern. Such features are typical of carved wooden bases designed to add aesthetic value and support structural design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds and mountains are depicted around the inner scene of the globe, giving depth and backdrop to the lighthouse setting. There is a clear visual separation between these elements and the globe's surface, avoiding direct intersection or overlap, which aids in constructing a dimensional and encompassing backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases rocks in earthy brown and green hues and water exhibitions in vibrant blues with gradients, consistent with natural color palettes. The shading blends to create visual harmony across the miniature scene within the globe, drawing from a realistic depiction of natural environments.",
