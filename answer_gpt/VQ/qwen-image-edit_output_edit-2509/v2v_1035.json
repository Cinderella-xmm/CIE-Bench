      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls maintain the recognizable shape and proportions of the giraffe without introducing unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are distinctly shaped as typical matryoshka dolls with smooth, symmetrical contours, exhibiting the traditional rounded form and painted with colorful floral designs. These shapes are not representative of a giraffe, which is characterized by a long neck, distinct facial structure, and unique body proportions. Thus, the dolls do not attempt to maintain or replicate the giraffe's shape and instead present an entirely different and unrelated form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the Russian nesting dolls consistent with the giraffe's fur pattern, avoiding unnatural or overly smooth surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Russian nesting dolls in Image B are characterized by a glossy surface typical of painted wooden objects, featuring floral designs. This is markedly different from the giraffe's skin pattern observed in Image A, which is fuzzy with irregular brown patches on a lighter background. The dolls display uniform, smooth surfaces and patterns, which are not consistent with the organic, textured fur pattern of the giraffe.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the different sizes of the Russian nesting dolls smooth, without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the Russian nesting dolls appear smooth and well-crafted, with each doll seamlessly fitting within the next larger size in a typical nesting manner. There are no visible seams or rough edges between the dolls, indicating a smooth transition typical of high-quality matryoshka sets.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of the Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table look balanced and natural, without any dolls appearing to float or overlap unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Russian nesting dolls are positioned on a flat wooden surface in Image B. They are neatly lined up from largest to smallest, each with a firm base, showing no signs of instability, floating, or unnatural overlapping. The arrangement appears balanced, akin to how such dolls are typically displayed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the Russian nesting dolls and the wooden table consistent with the lighting in the original image, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the lighting on the nesting dolls and the wooden table shows soft shadows consistent with a light source similar to that in Image A. The highlights and shadows on the dolls' glossy surfaces align with the lighting direction and intensity, avoiding unrealistic effects. The environment maintains coherency with the original image's lighting conditions, producing a natural appearance.",
