    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style representation of the golden car maintain its natural texture and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden car appears smooth and detailed, consistent with a realistic aesthetic. The lighting and shadows contribute to a natural look, and no obvious editing artifacts or distortions are visible. The car's texture is maintained with reflections typical of a metallic surface.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the 3D chibi-style golden car preserved, avoiding any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the golden car's body, wheels, and windows appear consistent with realistic expectations for a car model in terms of symmetry and alignment. There is no visible distortion or broken geometric shapes that would suggest any error in proportion or structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style golden car retain its essential features and style, reflecting the overall sense of reality and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The representation of the car in Image B maintains key features such as its shape, metallic sheen, and design details like doors and windows, which contribute to its realistic appearance. It retains fidelity to the typical style of a sedan car without exaggerated chibi-style distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the human hand grasping the edges of the frame appear natural with proper texture and detail, without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands visible in Image B are detailed with natural skin tone and texture, and the positioning of the fingers around the frame does not reveal any distortions or unnatural artifacts. The interaction with the frame looks convincingly realistic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the human hand and the emerging 3D chibi-style golden car visually credible and structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the setup includes hands holding a frame with a golden car inside. The spatial relation between the frame, hands, and car appears coherent, with proper alignment and perspective that matches a credible real-world scenario. This suggests structural coherence in the composition.",
