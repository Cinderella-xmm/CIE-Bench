      "question": "Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central block has been transformed from a simple geometric shape into a detailed 3D character with facial features and limbs. This transformation indicates changes in its geometric shape from a standard rectangular block to a more complex, chibi-style cartoon character. Their rounded features diverge from the initial structure seen in Image A, which solely presented an uncomplicated rectangular geometry.",

      "question": "Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks have been transformed into cartoon characters with expressive faces and arms, rather than remaining simple, red building blocks from Image A. Although they have adopted a lively and colorful persona, they do not maintain their original structural integrity, which was a simple rectangular form without additional modifications.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed background with soft pastel colors blend naturally with the foreground elements without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a soft pastel gradient that contrasts with the vibrant colors and playful designs of the foreground characters. The choice of soft pastel provides a gentle complement to the dynamic foreground, therefore blending smoothly without introducing any visible artifacts between the background and foreground elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the heart-shaped confetti elements evenly distributed and visually plausible without causing any loss of detail in the surrounding blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped confetti elements in Image B are dispersed around the scene in a manner that appears intentionally arranged to embellish the setting without causing visual clutter. They do not obscure the details of the cartoon characters and are appropriately scaled so as not to cause any loss of detail in the blocks or surrounding elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red blocks and the central green block maintain a consistent chibi aesthetic without any noticeable inconsistencies in style or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both red and green blocks have been transformed into characters with a chibi aesthetic, featuring soft edges, exaggerated facial features, and cartoonish designs. The uniformity in style and texture across these characters ensures a coherent appearance that aligns well within the chibi design scheme.",
