      "question": "Are the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls clearly defined and geometrically consistent, without broken or warped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's outlines are sharply drawn with smooth, straight lines that define the steeple, roof, and walls clearly. The precise geometry reflects a well-defined architectural form without distortion, suggesting purposeful art design without irregularities. This indicates a consistent and accurate depiction of the church's structure.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stained-glass windows in Image B are depicted with colorful patterns that have smooth transitions between the colors. The colors blend seamlessly, and the outlines of the patterns are crisp, indicating high-resolution art without pixelation or jagged edges.

      "question": "Are the candy-like tree replacements composed of smooth, continuous shapes with consistent surface textures, and do they maintain plausible proportions relative to the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candy-like trees are drawn with smooth curves and consistent textures that resemble lollipops. The shapes are continuous, devoid of breaks or abrupt changes in form. Their proportions relative to the church are plausible within the whimsical theme, maintaining a believable integration of these fantastical elements into the landscape.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B uses a patchwork quilt design where color patches blend smoothly into one another, creating a whimsical and consistent backdrop. The transitions are seamless, and the visual depiction lacks sharp discontinuities or visible seams, indicating a cohesive artistic design that reflects the playful aesthetic of the scene.",

      "question": "Do the light sources from the church windows cast consistent, soft shadows on the surrounding grass and path, matching the direction and intensity of the internal glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glow from the church windows does not visually cast shadows on the surrounding grass and path. While the light inside the church is vibrant, the exterior does not show a reflection of this light through neighboring shadows or light gradients, suggesting a difference in internal to external lighting effects.",
