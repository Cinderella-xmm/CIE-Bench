      "question": "Does the chibi-style illustration of the dog retain its distinct characteristics without unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated in a chibi style, characterized by simplified features and exaggerated proportions, which are typical of this artistic style. This approach maintains the dog's distinct characteristics by retaining its key features such as its color, pose, and general shape. The illustration avoids unnatural textures and retains sufficient detail for the style intended, appearing coherent within the context of a chibi design, which is usually simplistic yet recognizable.",

      "question": "Does the bold white outline around the illustration enhance visual clarity without disrupting structural coherence or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold white outline in Image B serves as a border that highlights and separates the illustrated elements from the background, enhancing visual clarity. Typically, such outlines provide emphasis on the central objects, improving visibility without disrupting their structure. The outline in Image B appears smooth and consistent, not introducing any artifacts or altering the shape, meaning structural coherence remains intact.",

      "question": "Do the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain structural consistency and visual credibility in their minimalist flat design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are rendered in a flat, minimalist style that simplifies their features but maintains recognizable shapes and proportions. Each item is depicted with clear, simple lines and shapes typical of minimalist design, retaining the structural consistency expected of these objects. The simplicity of this design lends itself to visual credibility, where the viewer easily identifies each element without distraction.",

      "question": "Does the extension of the dog and bench slightly beyond the circular frame preserve natural appearance and avoid distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the dog and the bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame, which allows the scene to feel more natural and grounded. This slight extension avoids the confinement of the circular frame effect, preventing any distortion or awkward cropping. Such a design choice can preserve balance within the layout and avoid the isolation of objects, maintaining harmony in the composition.",

      "question": "Does the transparent background maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent background in Image B contributes to a sticker-like appearance, allowing the illustration to appear as a separate entity that can be placed on any surface without disrupting its aesthetic. This transparency maintains the intended authenticity for sticker designs, where the focus is solely on the illustrated content without background interference, rendering a natural impression.",
