      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the checkmark pathway appear naturally tangled without breaking its geometric integrity or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the checkmark pathway has a tangled appearance with overlapping black lines that disrupt its geometric integrity, creating an unnatural artifact. Image A shows a clean pathway, while Image B introduces excessive tangles, breaking the neatness and clean flow expected from an infographic pathway.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the overlapping stamps on the 'We verify your Document' icon visually coherent and free from unnatural textures or excessive clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overlapping stamps on the icon create visual clutter that obscures the original simplicity and clarity seen in Image A. The addition of multiple red stamps adds unnecessary complexity and inhibits the clear presentation expected in an infographic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the red tape motif blend naturally into the orange circular step markers without causing visual disruption or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tape motif covers the orange circular markers, disrupting their visuals and losing detail. The markers in Image A are clear and distinct; however, the addition of red tape in Image B obstructs the view and creates an overall disjointed appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the icons and text within the orange circular step markers still legible and structurally consistent after the addition of the red tape motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the red tape motif in Image B hampers the legibility and structural consistency of the icons and text within the step markers. Compared to Image A, where these elements are clear and easily readable, Image B suffers from obstructions that affect clarity and readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the infographic maintained its clarity and sharpness without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a loss of clarity and sharpness due to the added scribbles and motifs, introducing unnatural textures and diminishing fine details. Image A presents a clean, sharp infographic without such distractions, thus demonstrating a loss in Image B.",
