    "Question": "Q1: Are the added cogs and gears on the lamp's armature properly aligned with the existing structure, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions without visible seams or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cogs and gears are visually integrated into the lamp's armature. The gears appear to be proportionate and align smoothly with the lampâ€™s design, without any visible seams or mismatches in texture. The mechanics blend well with the existing structure of the lamp, suggesting deliberate design to maintain consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the page edges of the open book display cog-like patterns that are integrated seamlessly into the paper texture without distorting the natural curl or layering of the pages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the open book's pages showcase cog-like patterns that are designed into the paper texture. The natural curl and layering of the pages are preserved, and the cog-like details are seamlessly integrated, maintaining the book's realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the rivet patterns applied to the floral wallpaper evenly spaced and dimensionally consistent with the wall surface, without causing distortions in the flower shapes or shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral wallpaper from Image A has been replaced with a panel featuring rivet patterns and mechanical designs. There is no floral wallpaper present in Image B; therefore, the question about distortions in flower shapes or shadows is inapplicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the color tone of the edited elements (lamp, books, wallpaper) consistent with the original warm vintage palette, showing no abrupt shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual harmony?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color tones of the lamp and books maintain the warm, vintage palette seen in Image A. The integration of additional elements like mechanical gears and new panels is executed without abrupt shifts in hue or brightness, preserving the overall visual harmony and aesthetic theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the mechanical additions (cogs, gears, rivets) proportionally scaled and structurally anchored to existing surfaces, avoiding floating or misaligned components that break spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical elements such as cogs, gears, and rivets are designed to be proportionally scaled and structurally anchored to surfaces like the lamp and new paneling. These elements do not appear to be floating or misaligned, but are instead integrated into the scene with logical spatial positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
