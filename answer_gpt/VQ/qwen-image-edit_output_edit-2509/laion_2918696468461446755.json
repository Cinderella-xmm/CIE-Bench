    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the trench coats and fedoras on all characters have natural fabric draping and proper fit without visible distortion or clipping against limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trench coats and fedoras appear to be well-fitted on the characters. The way they are illustrated suggests a natural draping of the fabric, which is consistent with how such garments would typically sit on the body. There are no visible distortions or signs of clipping against the limbs, indicating a proper fit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the grayscale foggy cityscape background smoothly blended with the characters, showing consistent atmospheric perspective and no sharp boundaries or lost architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grayscale foggy cityscape serves as a backdrop that is seamlessly integrated with the characters. The atmospheric perspective is maintained consistently, as the haze gently envelops the buildings without creating harsh lines or losing architectural details. This blending achieves a coherent atmospheric effect.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central character’s hand holding the magnifying glass show five fingers with natural curvature and grip, and is the magnifying glass proportionally sized and positioned as if being used realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character’s hand displays a natural grip on the magnifying glass, with a visible curvature that suggests a realistic hold. The magnifying glass is proportioned well relative to the hand and aligns with how such an object would be held and used for observation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the eyepatch on the central character’s face aligned with his facial structure and consistently shaded with the surrounding skin and lighting, without appearing detached or unnaturally bright/dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question refers to Image A, not to Image B. In Image B, no character is wearing an eyepatch.",

      "question": "Are the title “Whispers of Shadows” and subtitle “A Mysterious Journey” displayed in a serif font at the top, properly spaced, readable, and not overlapping any character or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title “Whispers of Shadows” and the subtitle “A Mysterious Journey” are presented in a serif font. The spacing is appropriate and enhances readability, as the text does not overlap with any other image elements, maintaining its legibility.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible streaks along the book edges. Therefore, the question regarding red streaks is inapplicable as there are neither such artifacts nor are there any noise or jagged edges present.",
