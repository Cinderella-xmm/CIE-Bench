      "question": "Does the boat exhibit consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns and no repeating or unnatural surface artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat appears to have a wooden texture that is stylized rather than realistic. The grains are simplified and there's a uniformity in the texture design that suggests a crafted or modeled appearance. This differs from typical aged wood, which would generally have more irregularities and natural grain patterns. Hence, the boat does not exhibit a consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered with smooth pastel blue gradients that transition naturally without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents distant hills that are depicted in a stylized manner with pastel blue gradients. These gradients transition smoothly without sharp boundaries or pixelation, suggesting a gradient that flows naturally from one tone to another, typical of clean digital illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small, clear droplet-like etchings on the water surface that resemble ripples without disrupting the reflection or causing visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface features clear droplet-like etchings that mimic ripples. These etchings are precise and do not disrupt the reflection on the water, nor do they cause any visual distortion, indicating a careful design meant to resemble realistic ripples.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a hand-carved wooden frame surrounding the scene with realistic texture, depth, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a wooden frame surrounding the scene. The frame appears to have a texture that imitates the look of carved wood, showing detailed patterns and a depth that adds structural coherence to its design. This suggests an intention to represent a realistic frame.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills arranged in layered 3D cutouts with correct spatial depth and no misalignment or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the boat, water, and hills in a manner that suggests layered 3D cutouts. The elements are aligned correctly with spatial depth, and there are no visible misalignment or floating elements, indicating careful arrangement consistent with layers in a 3D visualization.",
