        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the chibi wombat are large, round, and very expressive, which aligns with common stylistic choices for chibi designs that aim to emphasize cuteness and expressiveness.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is depicted in various dynamic poses. Chibi art often takes liberties with proportions for stylistic reasons, and the poses, though varied, maintain a visual consistency that matches the illustrative intent shown in Image A. The structure of the wombat in the chibi poses complements its cartoonish nature without appearing visually inconsistent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wombat wearing a Hawaiian shirt and straw hat in each pose. Despite the chibi art style simplifying details, the essential patterns like the shirt print and hat appearance are preserved and appear consistent with expectations for a cartoon character. There are no distracting artifacts, and details are visibly appropriate for the style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as hibiscus flowers and palm fronds are included in a manner that complements the chibi stickers, enhancing their tropical theme.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts each wombat sticker surrounded by a clear white outline, ensuring each sticker is distinct and separate. This clean space maintains clarity and avoids clutter, making each sticker stand out visually on its own, suitable for purposes such as keychains or stickers.",
