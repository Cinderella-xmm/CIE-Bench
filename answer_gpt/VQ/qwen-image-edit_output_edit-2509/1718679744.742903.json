      "question": "Does the bold black outline fully trace the crocodile's form without breaking or misaligning at joints, scales, or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold black outline around the crocodile is consistently applied, fully containing the entire form without breaking or misaligning at any of the joints, scales, or facial features. The outline follows the contours smoothly, indicating a deliberate artistic style consistent with cartoon or pop art, where outlines are typically well-defined to enhance visual separation and clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the hat and sunglasses vividly saturated but still preserving visible texture details like knit stitches and lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the hat and sunglasses are indeed vividly saturated, aligning with the pop art style which emphasizes bright, bold colors. However, the intrinsic texture details like knit stitches of the hat and lens reflections on the sunglasses are abstracted into geometric patterns and flat colors, typical of graphic art, and therefore do not preserve these details.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin repeat consistently across the neck, back, and limbs without gaps, overlaps, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin show consistent repetition across the entire body including the neck, back, and limbs. The design is maintained without conspicuous gaps or overlaps, giving the image a uniform visual style. The patterns do not seem distorted, which contributes to the cohesiveness of the edited artistic depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns aligned correctly with the crocodile’s head and body, showing no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized transformation, the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns appear well-aligned with the crocodile's head and body. The hat sits on top of the head properly, the sunglasses fit across the face, and the patterns conform to the body's surface, showing no signs of misalignment or floating components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic modifications maintain proportional accuracy for the crocodile’s facial features including its snout, teeth, and eye placement. Though stylized with bold outlines and vibrant colors, these features are recognizable and visually coherent, reflecting typical pop art interpretation without distortion.",
