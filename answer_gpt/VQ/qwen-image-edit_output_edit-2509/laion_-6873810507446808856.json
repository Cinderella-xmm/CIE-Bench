      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes added to the pancake surfaces positioned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the size and shape of the pancakes, without deforming the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes added to the pancake surfaces appear to be positioned with symmetry and are proportional to the size and shape of the pancakes. The design maintains the pancake's texture around the eyes, making them look like natural additions rather than deforming the existing surface. The shape and alignment contribute to a cohesive and balanced appearance, indicative of a careful and intentional design rather than random placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the butter pat still recognizable as a solid block with clean edges and natural lighting, even after being stylized as a hat, without exhibiting warped or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butter pat is stylized as part of a hat on the pancake characters, preserving its general block shape and the notion of being a solid. The added elements transform it creatively into a hat, while the clean edges and shading maintain its integrity as a distinct object. The design handles natural lighting effectively, emphasizing the solidity and recognizable form without introducing distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the syrup stream extend downward from the pancake stack in a continuous, smooth arc without abrupt breaks, pixelation, or unnatural viscosity that contradicts liquid behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the syrup stream is depicted as a dynamic and flowing element, capturing liquid behavior in an exaggerated but continuous manner. The arcs and flow across the panels support the narrative style, although exaggerated, they maintain consistency in their visual representation without abrupt breaks. The cartoon style may heighten the viscosity for dramatic effect, yet it aligns with the visual context, appearing intentional rather than flawed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added breakfast items (e.g., coffee cups, scrambled eggs) aligned with the depth and lighting of the original scene, maintaining consistent shadows and scale relative to the pancake stack?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, various breakfast items such as coffee cups, scrambled eggs, and others are included. They fit into the illustrative style, contributing to a thematic depiction rather than photorealistic consistency. The items form part of a fuller breakfast narrative without strict adherence to realism in scale or lighting but achieve a uniform visual language that complements other elements, like the pancake stack, despite reduced concern for realistic shadow or depth alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles and text boxes positioned in open areas of the frame without overlapping critical elements such as the pancake stack or syrup stream, and do they have clear, legible letterforms without jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, speech bubbles and text boxes are judiciously placed, avoiding overlap with essential elements like the pancake stack or syrup stream. The typography is clear and legible, designed with smooth lines that complement the comic nature. This placement ensures clarity and adds meaning without disrupting the image's main features, allowing both visual and textual elements to coexist without interference.",
