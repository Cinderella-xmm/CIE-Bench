      "question": "Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines covering the tower are visually continuous and appear to align well with the structural lines of the object they surround. The design of the vines maintains a consistent thickness, which suggests meticulous integration with the underlying architecture. The seamless appearance indicates intentional design to create an illusion of integration, thus reflecting continuity and alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing floral motifs are depicted to have a uniform emission of light, providing a harmonious glow that matches the warm tones of the sunset. The visual textures indicate a steady brightness that melds smoothly with the surrounding hues, avoiding any abrupt spikes in brightness or highlights that may seem out of place.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone platform anchors the structure symmetrically, aligning proportionately with the base of the tower. The craftsmanship suggests deliberate symmetry and balance, preventing visible warping or misalignment. The geometric design provides a stable foundation for the thematic enhancements introduced in the composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases arcane symbols that are evenly spaced and oriented correctly on the stone platform. Their design includes depth and appropriate shadowing, enhancing the illusion that they are carved into the stone, thus demonstrating artistic skill in rendering textured surfaces for realistic perception.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the towerâ€™s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebulae depicted in Image B flow seamlessly from the base of the tower upwards, smoothly blending into the orange gradient of the sky. The transition is fluid, without sharp edges or disjointed areas, integrating well with the ethereal qualities of the visual composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal pinnacle possesses distinct facets that effectively capture sunlight, showcasing subtle refractions indicative of a transparent crystalline structure. The clarity and precision of the facets avoid any blurring or distortion, highlighting the skilled detailing involved in rendering reflective surfaces.",
