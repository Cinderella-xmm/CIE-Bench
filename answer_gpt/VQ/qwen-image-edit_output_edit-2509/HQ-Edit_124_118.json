    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall appears to be part of a digital projection setup, indicated by the transparent screens. The waterfall maintains smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, which suggests careful digital rendering to prevent pixelation or geometric flaws. The use of digital screens implies a potential for pixelation, but the image does not show such artifacts, aligning with advanced projection technology.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks exhibit a glowing, fiber-optic-like appearance that spirals upward in a smooth, continuous fashion, respecting the natural contours of the branches. This coherence suggests sophisticated digital effects that create a uniform glow without interruptions. The absence of any patchiness in the glow reinforces the high quality of the projection.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the projections show vines with looping, spiral patterns that appear continuous and adhere to the laws of physics. This digital setup simulates vines elegantly, avoiding any floating or disconnected segments. The digital execution ensures geometrically realistic and possible vine structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a digital display environment where the background mimics natural landscapes and integrates seamlessly with the foreground. The consistent illumination and absence of abrupt changes between different sections ensure a cohesive visual presentation, indicating meticulous digital compositing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the projected textures are likely designed to resemble natural materials but may not achieve the same clarity as real-world textures. While the projections might imply detailed textures, they are inherently limited by digital resolution and may not present them sharply. The potential for pattern artifacts in digital displays further complicates achieving natural texture fidelity.",
