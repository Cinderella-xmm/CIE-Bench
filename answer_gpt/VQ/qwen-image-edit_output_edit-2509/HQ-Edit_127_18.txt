    "Question": "Q1: Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
    "explanation": "The vintage travel case has clear, sharp boundaries that are visible and consistent within the scene. The style and color harmonize with the objects inside, without any abrupt shifts in lighting or perspective. The consistent lighting across the case and its contents suggests integration. World knowledge about photography and image composition supports the idea that uniform lighting and style maintain seamless integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
    "explanation": "The resin grass in Image B appears with varied lengths and angles among the blades, resembling real grass behavior. Soft shadows are cast underneath, suggesting consistency with the overhead light source. Common understanding of realism in diorama settings supports these observational conclusions on variation and shadow behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature acacia tree is notably smaller compared to the elephant. It stands closer to the edge of the case, providing depth and aligning with diorama styling for scale perception. World knowledge about diorama setups aids in understanding the significance of size differentiation to convey perspective rightly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
    "explanation": "The clouds on the lid of Image B are visually flat implying they are indeed painted. They lack specular highlights or shadows that moving, suspended objects might cast. Common knowledge about paint and light interaction supports recognizing this lack as indicative of painted surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
    "explanation": "The compass appears flat on the base in Image B, displaying a reflection that mirrors the lighting from above. The shadow lines up well with the directional light consistent with the other shadows observed. Background understanding of material properties helps affirm these details confirming positional consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature elephant's skin texture looks real, and its limbs and tusks are proportioned correctly without pixelation or deformation. Knowledge about elephant anatomy confirms these visual details, ensuring the elephant model retains realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
    "explanation": "The diorama in Image B shows shadows cast by the objects, all aligning directionally and with similar softness, implying uniform lighting from above. Understanding of light physics and real-world illumination guides the conclusion of single light source consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
