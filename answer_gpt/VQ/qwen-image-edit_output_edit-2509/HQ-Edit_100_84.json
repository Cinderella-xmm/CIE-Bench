      "question": "Are the added decorative patterns on the dhow’s hull and deck aligned with the wood grain and structural lines, and do they lack jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative patterns on the dhow’s hull and deck appear to be integrated well with the overall structure. The alignment with the wood grain gives a sense of cohesion, and the designs do not exhibit jagged edges or unnatural textures. This suggests that the addition of these patterns was done smoothly, enhancing the vessel's aesthetics without detracting from its natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mythical sea creatures near the dhow have smooth contours, realistic scales or skin textures, and proper interaction with the water surface (e.g., ripples, reflections)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts mythical sea creatures with smooth, flowing contours. Their scales or skin textures appear to be artistically detailed, contributing to a realistic fantasy portrayal. The creatures interact with the water surface, as seen through ripples that suggest movement, and the presence of reflections further supports a believable interaction with the water.",

      "question": "Are the blue and gold tones applied consistently across the scene without causing color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of detail in shaded areas of the boat and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue and gold tones are applied throughout the depiction, maintaining a consistent color scheme. The shading in the boat and water outlines is clear without any signs of color bleeding or pixelation. The image preserves detail across the various light and shadow areas, such as the hull’s patterns and the water surface, indicating a clean use of color.",

      "question": "Are the distant sailboats rendered as dark, simplified shapes that maintain their boat-like outline and do not merge into the sky or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows distant sailboats rendered as dark silhouettes against the lighter background. These simplified shapes maintain a distinct outline representative of boats, ensuring they are discernible despite being far away in the scene. Their contrast with the sky and water allows them to stand out without merging into surrounding elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Arabian skyline mirage at the horizon rendered with a soft, shimmering effect that blends with the sky and water, and does it display geometric patterns without sharp edges or solid blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Arabian skyline at the horizon appears as a delicate mirage with a shimmering effect that harmonizes with the sky and water. The geometric patterns are rendered smoothly, providing a subtle and integrated appearance without sharp edges or solid blocks that would distract from the overall harmony of the scene.",
