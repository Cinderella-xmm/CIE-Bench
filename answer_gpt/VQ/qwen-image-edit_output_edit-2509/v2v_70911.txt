    "Question": "Q1: Does the crack on the Axe container appear natural and maintain the structural integrity of the container without any visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the Axe container with a crack and an explosion of nebula energy emanating from it. The crack seems irregular and not typical for the material or design of a container, suggesting it might be artificially created to feature the nebula interaction. Such extensive structural damage would likely compromise the integrity of the container, indicating visible artifacts.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the miniature nebula inside the container blend naturally with the interior of the container and maintain visual plausibility?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a nebula inside the container, visibly bursting out. While the artistic design is intriguing, the blending is exaggerated since a nebula, typically found in outer space, would unlikely fit realistically in such a context, appearing visually implausible.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the cosmic dust and gases within the nebula detailed and textured, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the nebula features vibrant details and colors with textures that adequately represent cosmic dust and gases, avoiding noticeable pixelation or artifacts, maintaining a smooth visual quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the size and shape of the nebula fit naturally within the container's opening, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the nebula spilling out of the container with expansive energy, making the size and shape disproportionate to the container's opening, thereby decreasing structural consistency and visual credibility as it exceeds plausible boundaries.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues in the nebula consistent with the label design and contribute to the overall natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "The nebula's hues in Image B mirror the label's red and pink design elements, establishing a thematic consistency that enhances visual coherence. While they are artistically compatible, they do contribute an exaggerated aesthetic rather than a natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
