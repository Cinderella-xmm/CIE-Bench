      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss textures on the tusks appear to follow the natural curvature of the tusks, adhering to their form. The shading and highlights present on the moss textures seem consistent with the lighting direction, which suggests attention to detail in terms of realistic shadow casting on a curved surface. Considering the warthog’s modified fantasy appearance, the textures maintain visual coherence without distracting discrepancies.",

      "question": "Does the waterfall-like mane flow continuously from the top of the head downward without intersecting or distorting the snout or ear regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waterfall-like mane flows smoothly over the back of the warthog's head and onto its back, without intersecting the snout or ear regions. The flow is uninterrupted and respects the anatomical boundaries where the mane is intended to cover. The mane gives the impression of water flowing gently, reinforcing its unique fantasy style elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaf-styled patterns aligned with the natural folds and contours of the warthog’s body, avoiding abrupt edges or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, leaf-styled patterns are integrated into the body of the warthog. The placement of the leaves follows the contours and curves of the body, providing a seamless appearance without abrupt or mismatched edges. The patterns are consistently applied, enhancing the body’s natural structure while contributing to the fantastical design.",

      "question": "Are the fungi positioned along the spine and upper back without overlapping legs or protruding unnaturally into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fungi are placed along the warthog’s spine and upper back, aligned logically with these areas without overlapping the legs or extending unnaturally. They maintain distribution across the back, emphasizing the fantasy theme without compromising the underlying physicality of the warthog.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing eyes remain within the eye sockets, preserving the shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warthog’s eyes are depicted as glowing, which emphasizes a mystical appearance. The glowing effect remains within the bounds of the eye sockets, preserving the anatomy of the eyelids and overall positioning within the head’s contours. This maintains a natural shape conducive to the warthog's facial structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branch-shaped hooves connect naturally to the lower legs and maintain consistent joint alignment without breaking the leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch-shaped hooves seem to connect logically to the warthog's lower legs, maintaining anatomical alignment throughout the joint structures. The transformation into a branch-like aesthetic does not disrupt the continuity of the warthog’s leg structure, allowing for believable leg functionality, despite the fantasy modifications.",
