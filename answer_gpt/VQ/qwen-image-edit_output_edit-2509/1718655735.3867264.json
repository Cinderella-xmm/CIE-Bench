    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the fairy have consistent transparency, smooth surface curvature, and realistic reflections without visible artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B has a smooth curvature, and the transparency is consistent throughout. Reflections appear realistic, following the smooth nature of the dome surface, without apparent jagged edges or unnatural refractions. This suggests a well-rendered glass surface based on observation of typical rendering standards.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wooden base beneath the fairy rendered with realistic wood grain patterns, consistent shading, and no artificial or distorted surface features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B shows distinct wood grain patterns and consistent shading, characteristic of naturally finished wood. The absence of artificial or distorted features in the base indicates well-rendered material representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings' metallic surfaces evenly lit with subtle highlights and reflections, maintaining intact venation patterns and no visible texture repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings show a metallic sheen with even lighting. The highlights and reflections are subtle but present, and the venation patterns appear intact without texture repetition or distortion, suggesting a realistic rendering.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the fabric textures on the fairyâ€™s outfit appear detailed and continuous, with no abrupt transitions, blurring, or inconsistencies in thread patterns or material thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric textures on the fairy's outfit in Image B appear highly detailed and continuous. The material demonstrates consistency in thread patterns and material thickness, with no abrupt transitions or blurring, indicating realistic representation.",
      "weight": 1,

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating petals and leaves in Image B are characterized by varying depths, soft edges, and a translucent appearance. They do not display overlapping errors or unnatural placements, suggesting careful positioning in relation to the fairy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the blue gradient background smoothly transitioned without visible color bands, pixelation, or irregularities in tone distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue gradient background in Image B is evenly transitioned without any visible color bands or pixelation. The tone distribution is consistent, indicating a smooth gradient effect.",
