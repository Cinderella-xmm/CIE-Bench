      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the golden title banner positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting the cat’s head or the window frame, and does it have a natural metallic sheen that matches the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden title banner is positioned at the top of the image, above the cat's head, aligning correctly with the natural layout expected of a trading card format. It does not interfere with or distort the cat’s head or the window frame behind it. The title banner appears to have a metallic sheen that matches the ambient light in the scene, suggesting an understanding of lighting in the 3D rendered style. This appearance of a natural shine further supports the conclusion that it is designed with a semi-realistic approach consistent with the rest of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the nameplate located at the bottom of the image without intersecting or deforming the cat’s tail or the wooden floor, and does it have clean edges and consistent material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nameplate is positioned at the bottom of the image, below the cat’s tail, and above the wooden floor. It does not intersect or deform either the tail or the floor, which indicates proper layering and placement. The nameplate’s edges appear clean, and its texture is consistent with a metallic or polished material, aligning well with the semi-realistic 3D style of the image. This adherence to stylistic consistency suggests that the design was intentionally organized to maintain visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stat bars clearly visible and positioned without overlapping the cat’s fur or the window, and do they use a font and color scheme that match the overall polished, soft 3D art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stat bars are visible and positioned within their own dedicated space, not interfering with the cat’s fur or the window. Their layout underneath the cat suggests clear planning to avoid overlap. Additionally, the font and color scheme for 'Agility,' 'Curoity,' and 'Charm' are chosen to complement the overall polished, soft 3D art style. The colors of the bars are distinct yet harmonious, aiding in readability and aesthetic cohesion, consistent with the semi-realistic rendering style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the metallic trim form a complete, continuous border around the image without gaps, misaligned corners, or unnatural reflections that contradict the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic trim forms a complete and continuous border around the image, creating a frame that encapsulates the card's design. There are no visible gaps or misaligned corners, which signifies careful attention to detail in maintaining structural integrity. The reflections on the trim appear consistent with the lighting direction of the scene, supporting the overall coherence of a semi-realistic 3D rendering. The trim’s design contributes to the professional and polished look expected in such themed content.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style where the cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all exhibit smooth textures and no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rendering of the cat’s fur is smooth, with detailed textures that emphasize the semi-realistic 3D style. The window and other background elements are similarly consistent in quality, providing a natural look without any pixelation or blurring. The added elements, such as the banner and stat bars, fit seamlessly into the overall design, echoing the same texture and resolution quality as the rest of the image. There are no geometric distortions present, suggesting a high level of attention to maintaining stylistic uniqueness and coherence across all elements.",
