    "Question": "Q1: Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the doors retain their gullwing shape but slightly resemble raised structures with rounded appearances. They are symmetrically placed on each side, showing smooth integrations with the car without noticeable clipping or distortion. Common knowledge about car designs helps in recognizing the integration of new elements into existing designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the grille has not been altered into a cross-shaped directional pad; it maintains the traditional Mercedes grille form. Therefore, it lacks the features described, such as the directional pad segments. The spacing and centering beneath the emblem do not match the question description.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car's exterior is metallic red with gloss highlights that smoothly follow the car's curves. The light reflection appears realistic, adhering to natural contours without flat areas or abrupt changes. This analysis uses observations of how light interacts with surfaces in real environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows an emblem on the door interior that resembles control elements with clear, well-defined lines and harmonious integration with surrounding materials. Although slightly futuristic in appearance, it fits well without appearing displaced or blurry. Recognition of design elements commonly found in advanced vehicle interfaces aids this analysis.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the car’s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a logo placed on the hood. Although its design deviates from traditional branding, it appears centrally positioned with defined edges, maintaining alignment with the car’s structure. Knowledge of vehicle branding positions aids the judgement of logo placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all edited components (shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, hood logo) fully attached to the car body with no floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends in the structure?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, edited components like the shoulder buttons and hood logo are integrated well with the car’s body, showing no signs of floating, misalignment, or unnatural bends. The judgement is supported by understanding how objects need to physically integrate with surfaces to appear naturally attached.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections at the boundaries of edited regions (e.g., door edges, grille perimeter, hood logo)?",
    "explanation": "Image B appears clear without visible artifacts like jagged lines or unnatural reflections in the boundaries of edited regions. The smooth transitions in visual presentation help identify a lack of such imperfections, which is consistent with expectations for clean edits in professional image retouching.",
    "answer": "No"
