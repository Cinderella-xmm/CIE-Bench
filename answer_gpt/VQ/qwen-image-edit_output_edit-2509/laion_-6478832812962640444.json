      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the areas on the boot's shaft and vamp that previously might have featured stitched embroidery are now replaced with intricate metallic inlay textures. These metallic patterns are consistent throughout, with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels, indicating a smooth and well-integrated design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boot's heel is designed as a stepped, geometric structure. It appears to be well-aligned with both the sole and the boot shaft, featuring clean and sharp geometric edges. There are no indications of floating or misaligned segments, suggesting a cohesive design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed patterns in Image B, located along the shaft and toe area, are composed of sharp, precise geometric lines. These lines maintain the boot's outline without causing any visible swelling or compression, preserving the natural form and symmetry of the boot.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic inlays exhibit consistent and uniform specular highlights. There are no apparent bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections, which would typically suggest digital noise or over-processing. The highlights are smooth and aligned with the metallic texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a boot that maintains a natural foot-shaped profile. The proportions of the toe box, ankle, and shaft height are balanced and symmetric, with no signs of unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry. The design updates have not distorted the overall boot shape.",
