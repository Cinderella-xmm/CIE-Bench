    "Question": "Q1: Are the gemstone inlays embedded into the crown surface without visible gaps or floating elements, and does the crown retain the original curvature of the marble top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crown appears to be decorated with colorful gemstones that seem seamlessly integrated into the surface, without any visible gaps or floating elements, which suggests a cohesive and well-crafted design. Considering the original curvature of the marble top in Image A, the crown in Image B does not attempt to replicate that curvature; instead, it adopts the typical rounded shape of a crown, independent of the marble surface curve.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the drawer engravings positioned at the waistline as belt buckles, aligned with the robe’s structure, and connected with visible straps or fastenings that appear physically plausible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the central motifs of the drawers in Image A are reimagined as ornate belt buckles on the robe. These elements fit naturally into the design of a belt and appear to be part of the robe’s structure, with visible straps and fastenings that would be necessary for a physically plausible attachment. This adjustment uses the cabinet’s original design elements effectively, adapting them to fit a new context.",

The clawed feet are positioned naturally, with the claws proportionally sized and appearing to make full contact with the ground, creating a cohesive and believable stance.
