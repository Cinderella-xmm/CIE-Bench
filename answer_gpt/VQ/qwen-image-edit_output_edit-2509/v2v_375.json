      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters maintain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortion in their body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi-style format inherently exaggerates certain features, such as larger heads compared to the body, but within the conventions of chibi art, these characters maintain consistent proportions. Their body shapes show typical rounded and exaggerated features in a way that is standard for chibi characters, indicating intentional design rather than distortion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outfits, such as the changpao and xiuhe gown, are richly detailed with vibrant colors and intricate patterns that are in harmony with chibi aesthetics.

      "question": "Does the ruby-red backdrop with the \"囍\" paper-cut design blend naturally with the rest of the image, enhancing the festive atmosphere without causing visual disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop is a solid ruby-red, common for festive or celebratory images in Chinese culture. The '囍' or 'double happiness' design sits well within the background, complementing the scene's festive attire and colors. This seamless integration effectively enhances the wedding theme without drawing focus away from the characters.",

      "question": "Are the golden dragon and phoenix designs on the chibi characters' outfits detailed and coherent, without any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon and phoenix designs on the outfits are clearly visible and detailed, with smooth, well-defined lines that represent these symbols accurately. The gold used in these designs is vibrant and consistent, without blurring or unnatural texture. This attention to detail contributes to the overall coherence of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image, including the chibi characters, horse-drawn carriage, and festive backdrop, remain structurally consistent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features chibi characters with a backdrop suited to their design style, omitting the horse-drawn carriage present in Image A. This choice avoids structural inconsistency; the composition is visually credible for a chibi art style. The lack of a carriage, combined with the presence of a rich, thematic backdrop, creates a consistent aesthetic for depicting a traditional event.",
