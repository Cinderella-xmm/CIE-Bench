      "question": "Does the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" introduce any unnatural textures or visibly distorted areas on the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added text 'Warm Home' and 'Adopt Love' is positioned above and below the cat. The regions they occupy do not conflict or interfere directly with the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes. The words are placed away from these elements, minimizing the chance of distortion or unnatural textures on them. Common sense suggests that if text is placed on a different area than the fur and whiskers, it shouldn't introduce texture inconsistencies in those specific regions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the placement of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" maintain structural consistency and avoid disrupting the proportions and physical rationality of the cat's face and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Warm Home' is placed at the top and 'Adopt Love' at the bottom. This strategic placement does not intrude upon or obscure the cat's structural elements like the body proportions, as they are positioned along the margins. The text's placement avoids transgressing into the central areas occupied by the cat, reducing disruption in physical rationality. World knowledge about image composition dictates the importance of strategic placement to avoid structural imbalance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the natural appearance and authenticity of the cat's expression, fur pattern, and posture been preserved despite the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the natural appearance of the cat's body, fur pattern, and posture. The text does not overlap or interfere with these physical features, ensuring their visibility and authenticity. This preservation is typical in image editing where text is added strategically to avoid covering essential features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the cat, such as individual strands of fur, whiskers, and paw pads, free from blurring or pixelation after the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the cat's fine details like strands of fur, whiskers, and paw pads appear sharp and detailed. The strategic placement of text has ensured these components remain unaffected by any potential blurring or pixelation that could arise from text overlay. Effective image editing usually preserves such critical details behind added elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" into the image avoid logical inconsistencies such as overlapping unnaturally with the cat's fur or appearing embedded in a way that defies common sense?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text is integrated along the top and bottom portions of the image, ensuring it does not overlap unnaturally with the fur, whiskers, paws, or body of the cat. It remains visually and contextually separate from the cat, avoiding incongruities that would arise from inappropriate placement or embedding. Basic image editing principles strive to maintain logical distancing from central objects.",
