      "question": "Does the woman’s face maintain symmetrical features with proportionate eyes, nose, and mouth, and does her hair flow naturally without unnatural bending or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "This question cannot be assessed because the woman's face is blurred, making it impossible to evaluate the symmetry and proportions of her facial features. However, analyzing the hair in Image B, it seems to flow naturally without visible unnatural bends or clippings. The hair appears to be smoothly draped over her shoulders, consistent with a natural appearance based on common hairstyle norms.",

      "question": "Are the gold-embossed floral patterns on the robe evenly distributed, aligned with the fabric folds, and free from pixelation or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe features gold-embossed floral patterns that appear well-integrated with the fabric. The patterns seem to follow the natural folds, suggesting they have been aligned to complement the garment's design. There is no visible pixelation or floating edges, indicating that the patterns are rendered with care to blend seamlessly with the robe.",

      "question": "Do the red lanterns emit a soft, consistent glow that illuminates nearby areas without creating harsh halos or unrealistic light leakage onto the woman’s robe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red lanterns in Image B appear to emit a soft, consistent glow that is visually pleasing. The lighting effect on the surroundings seems subtle and plausible. There are no obvious harsh halos or unrealistic lighting effects that spill onto the woman's robe, suggesting the light source is managed well within the image's context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background rendered as a uniform cream paper texture with faint month grids and floral patterns matching the robe’s design, without overlapping or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a cream paper-like texture that provides a neutral backdrop for the calendar elements. The floral patterns in the background complement those on the robe, and the month grids appear faint but legible. There are no visible overlaps or misalignments that disrupt the visual cohesion of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the calendar grid lines and month labels positioned in a way that follows the floral patterns of the robe without causing misalignment or breaking the continuity of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid lines and month labels are arranged in a manner that boosts the overall harmony of the image. They follow the design flow without disrupting or clashing with the floral patterns on the robe, maintaining an aesthetic balance. The positioning seems deliberate to ensure continuity between calendar elements and the robe's design.",
