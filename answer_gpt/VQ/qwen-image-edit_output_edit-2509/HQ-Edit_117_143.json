      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the golden crescent moon reflection on the ground aligned with the position of the moon in the sky and does it follow realistic light reflection patterns on the tiled surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crescent moon's reflection aligns well with the moon's position above. However, realistic lighting on a tiled surface would typically show more spread or diffuse reflection. The reflection in Image B seems more stylized, suited to artistic interpretation.",
