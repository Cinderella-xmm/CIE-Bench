      "question": "If motion trajectory lines were added around the horse, would they appear naturally integrated with the environment without disrupting the image's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, motion trajectory lines have been introduced around the horse and the skater figures. To assess their natural integration, we look for consistent style and color schemes that match the existing elements in the image. Since the lines do not interfere visually with the background or the primary subjects, and they mimic motion traces commonly used in sports photography, they appear harmonious with the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "If a skater was added near the house in the background, would the scale and perspective match the existing scene correctly, maintaining structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is placed in the foreground along with the horse, not near the house. Thus, assessing the skater's scale would involve determining if the figure fits naturally within the coastline setting, respecting relative sizes and perspectives. Considering Image A, the primary elements include the horse and the background houses. If the skater were placed near the house, maintaining structural consistency would require a reduced size to match the distant perspective. However, since this scenario is not present in Image B, we can't make a comparative assessment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "If the skater's three motion phases were imposed over the sea and land, would the transitions between these phases look smooth without introducing artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the skater's three motion phases are displayed in a seamless sequence across the land area. The lines enhance the perception of continual motion without abrupt changes between frames. The edits maintain a consistent quality, blending the added elements smoothly with the existing texture of the landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Would the details of the horse's fur texture and the surrounding grass remain visually coherent and undistorted after adding the skater's motion trajectory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines are predominantly around the skater figure. The horse's details, including the fur texture, remain intact and undistorted, as do the textures of the surrounding grass. The edits do not disrupt these natural elements, illustrating that their visual coherence is preserved post-editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "If the skater's starting motion frames were placed in this scenic setting, would the composition maintain balance and coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skater is positioned in a dynamic stance, commencing a motion sequence, maintaining an aesthetically pleasing flow in Image B. The alignment with the horse and the continuity in motion depicted enhance the scene's overall balance. The skater complements the natural setting, contributing to a balanced composition without appearing jarring or mismatched with the environment.",
