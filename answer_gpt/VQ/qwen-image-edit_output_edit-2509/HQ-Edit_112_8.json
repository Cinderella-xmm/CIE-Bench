    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a serif font with a distressed gold texture that matches the typewriter’s material and color tone, and does it appear seamlessly integrated into the image without overlapping or obscuring key objects like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Stories Through Time' is clearly visible at the top. The font used appears to have serif characteristics, which are often associated with a more formal and classic aesthetic, aligning with the vintage theme of the image. The color of the text is a distressed gold shade, reminiscent of the metallic parts of the typewriter, effectively matching its color tone. The text placement avoids overlapping with key objects such as the typewriter or lamp, ensuring seamless integration into the visual scene without obstruction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sepia filter apply evenly across all elements—such as the wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall—without causing uneven color shifts, loss of texture detail, or artificial flattening of shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a sepia filter that imparts a uniform warm tone across the entire image. This type of filter is often used to create a vintage or nostalgic effect. The desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall each display this sepia tint, and there is no evidence of loss of detail or texture in the surfaces or elements, nor is there uneven color shift or flattening of shadows and highlights. This consistency in coloration helps maintain the depth and dimension of the original objects and settings within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ghostly pages positioned around the typewriter in a flowing, semi-transparent manner, avoiding sharp edges or unnatural overlaps with solid objects like the typewriter body or desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ghostly pages in Image B appear to hover and float around the typewriter, exhibiting a semi-transparent quality. This transparency ensures the pages do not look like solid physical objects, and they create a soft, ethereal effect. The integration is smooth, with flowing lines that avoid sharp edges or unnatural overlaps with the typewriter and desk, thus maintaining a harmonious balance between the original solid elements and the stylistic additions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Art Deco border present along the edges of the image, featuring symmetrical geometric patterns and consistent thickness, without cutting into or distorting any central elements like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Art Deco border in Image B is designed with characteristic symmetry and geometric patterns typical of the style. It runs along the edges of the image without encroaching upon or distorting the central elements, such as the typewriter or lamp. The consistent thickness of the border ensures it complements rather than competes with the focal objects, reinforcing the vintage theme without compromising the integrity of the image's composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the typewriter retain its original shape, alignment of keys, and mechanical structure without visible deformation, stretching, or broken geometry despite the addition of new elements like text and ghostly pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the additional elements such as text and ghostly pages, the typewriter maintains its original form and mechanical integrity. The alignment of the keys and the overall structure remains unchanged, indicating no visible deformation, stretching, or broken geometry was introduced during the editing process. This preservation of the typewriter's features suggests careful integration of new artistic elements that respect the mechanical detail and appearance of the central object.",
