      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the stave church have clear, smooth surfaces with realistic reflections and no visible distortion or warping of the church beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case appears to have smooth surfaces without any visible distortion or warping of the church inside. The glass is executed with enough clarity to neither obscure nor significantly alter the view of the church, which suggests a well-made case that correctly reflects realistic glass properties. The absence of any exaggerated curvature or visual disturbances indicates the designer's intent to portray a realistic glass structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layered clouds in the background panel translucent and softly blended, showing depth without blocking or distorting the mountain range behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds appear lightly layered and gently blended, suggesting a mild translucency. They are soft and create a sense of depth, ensuring they don't completely obscure other background elements like mountains. The combination of softly blended clouds with visible yet not overpowering mountain imagery aligns with a strategic layering that imparts depth without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the small coniferous trees near the base of the church properly scaled, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the larger trees in the surrounding forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small coniferous trees placed around the church appear miniaturized, harmonizing with the scale of the church and elements in the display case. Their arrangement seems methodical and proportionate. However, considering this is an artistic representation in a display case, stylistic consistency with a hypothetical surrounding forest is secondary to fitting the visual and thematic balance within the constrained space. Their design coherence suggests intent rather than an oversight.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains and sky in the background use a consistent muted palette that complements the dark wood tones of the church without creating jarring color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features mountains and sky in soft, muted tones. These colors complement the darker, more pronounced wood tones of the church, creating a cohesive and visually pleasing palette. The lack of harsh contrasts between components ensures harmony within the scene, supporting an artistic choice that prefers a subtle and complementary color scheme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the footprints on the snowy path subtle, evenly spaced, and aligned toward the entrance of the church, without appearing artificial or overly pronounced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the footprints in the snow are depicted with a subtlety that keeps them from dominating the scene. They are consistently spaced and lead directly to the church entrance, ensuring they seem purposeful and naturally implemented. Their understated presence maintains the serene and balanced aesthetic of the overall composition.",
