      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the watercolor effect applied across the image retain the structural coherence of the skater's pose and the ramp's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watercolor effect typically involves transforming sharp edges into smoother, painted strokes which can sometimes distort structural details. In Image B, although details are softened, the skater's pose and the overall form of the ramp are still identifiable and coherent. This suggests that the essential structural elements have been preserved despite the stylistic changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors used for the ground and background buildings free from unnatural textures and artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Watercolor effects often involve smoothing and blending of colors, creating a natural transition and abstract representation. In Image B, the ground and background exhibit smooth and cohesive blending without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures, retaining a natural look typical of watercolor paintings.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the skater’s body and clothing retained their proportions and physical rationality after applying the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Applying a watercolor style may change the texture and detail but ideally should maintain the overall proportions and anatomy for structural integrity. In Image B, the skater's body and clothing still appear proportionate and rational in form, demonstrating that the watercolor style did not alter these aspects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes remain discernible after the watercolor treatment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Watercolor effects can blur and fade detailed features, making them less distinguishable. In Image B, the intricate details on the skater's gray t-shirt and the contour of the black shoes have become less distinct, blending into the overall texture and style of the watercolor effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the shapes and lines of the skater’s hands remained ergonomic and natural under the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the skater's hands to appear ergonomic and natural, they should retain a recognizable shape even after stylistic changes. In Image B, despite the watercolor effect, the hands maintain their natural curve and form, indicating a preservation of ergonomic structure.",
