      "question": "Does the arched typography sit correctly above the Opera House without distorting its shape or creating visual inconsistencies in scale and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typography featuring the text 'A CAPYBBA'S SYDNEY ESCAPE' is positioned above the Opera House and follows an arched layout. The text does not overlap with nor distort the visual shape of the Opera House; instead, it complements the image composition by being placed in the sky area. It maintains a consistent scale relative to the entirety of the image, enhancing the visual depth without inconsistencies. This reflects proper placement and design coherence.",

      "question": "Does the capybaraâ€™s hand holding the drink have five fingers with natural spacing, ergonomic curvature, and realistic texture without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The capybara in Image B holds a drink with a correctly edited, anthropomorphic hand featuring five fingers. The spacing between the fingers and the ergonomic curvature follows a lifelike natural arrangement, akin to a realistic hand grasping objects comfortably. The texture rendering of the hand aligns with the overall style and retains realism without showing any distortion or presence of extra digits. This suggests careful detailed editing in the anthropomorphic portrayal.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the capybara, the drink, and the reflected light on the water surface correspond well with the direction of the sunset visible in the sky.

This showcases an understanding of environmental lighting in image editing.",
