    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the golden highlights on the grape clusters follow the natural curvature and lighting direction of the grapes without appearing as separate, overlaid patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the grape clusters seem to follow the curvature and lighting direction of the grapes. They do not appear as separate, overlaid patches but rather follow the natural form of the grapes, suggesting an integrated design that respects the natural light play and contours of the grape surface. These observations are drawn from the symmetry with the vine's orientation and the light source direction indicated by the shadows in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the twisted vine design of the cane maintain smooth, continuous curves and proportional thickness consistent with a natural vine, without sharp breaks or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cane with a twisted vine design that maintains smooth, continuous curves and proportional thickness. The lack of sharp breaks or irregularities suggests a model consistent with the organic structure of a vine. This conclusion is based on observing the visual flow of the vine, which emphasizes the continuity seen in natural growth patterns of vines.",

      "question": "Are the ornate filigree details on the suit’s fabric seamlessly integrated into the existing weave pattern without visible outlines or layering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate filigree details on the suit's fabric are intricately placed without visible outlines or layering artifacts. The decorations appear to be woven into the fabric in a way that complements the existing herringbone texture, suggesting technique mastery in aligning the filigree with the fabric’s texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vineyard-themed symbols positioned in the corner(s) of the image at a scale and orientation that integrates naturally with the composition without appearing misplaced or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B strategically places vineyard-themed symbols in the corners, harmoniously integrating into the composition. These symbols are scaled appropriately, blending well without appearing misplaced or oversized, aligning with compositional norms that dictate balance and proportional representation in visual design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the cane have exactly five fingers with natural positioning, skin texture, and shadowing consistent with the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the cane shows exactly five fingers that are positioned naturally. The skin texture and shadowing are consistent with the figure’s overall presentation, indicating a coherent and realistic representation that matches anatomical accuracy and texture continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all added or modified elements (golden highlights, filigree, symbols, cane design) rendered in colors that fall within the earthy tone range and do not introduce jarring or non-matching hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays added and modified elements such as golden highlights, filigree, symbols, and cane design in colors that fall within the earthy tone range. The colors harmonize with the rest of the image, ensuring visual cohesion without introducing any jarring or non-matching hues, maintaining the warmth and natural palette commonly found in vineyard imagery.",
