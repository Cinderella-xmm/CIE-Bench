    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire cathedral structure appear uniformly rendered in warm stained wood with consistent grain patterns and realistic wood textures across all surfaces, including spires, arches, and tracery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral is depicted as being made entirely of wood, with warm tones and grain patterns that suggest a uniform material throughout the structure. The visual details of the spires, arches, and tracery consistently exhibit a wood texture, which is highlighted by the coherence in color and grain, indicating a possible finishing in stained wood. This consistency suggests a deliberate choice to render the entire model in a uniform manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the edges of the shadow box clearly defined, structurally coherent, and proportionally sized relative to the cathedral model, with no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow box containing the cathedral model is observable and appears to be well-constructed. The edges are cleanly defined, creating a coherent border around the model. The cathedral fits proportionally within the space, indicating correct sizing. There are no visible gaps or misalignments, and all elements appear grounded within the shadow box, ensuring structural coherence and proper integration of components.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the tiny pews and chandeliers positioned correctly within the interior of the cathedral model, maintaining proper scale and alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults, and do they cast consistent shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, small pews and chandeliers are visible as part of the environment within the shadow box. They appear to be positioned in a manner consistent with their architectural surroundings. The pews are arranged in front of the cathedral, aligning with stairs and entrances, while the chandeliers are hung from the upper sections, complementing the gothic style. However, there are issues of shadow casting and consistency, which are not clearly visible or coherent, impacting the overall perception of scale and alignment.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the clock mechanism located at the back of the model, featuring visible gears and a moving path for small figures, with no distorted shapes, inconsistent materials, or implausible motion trajectories?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock is prominently displayed in the center of the cathedral, rather than at the back. It does not showcase gears or moving paths typically associated with mechanisms for small figures. The focus here is on its static presence as a decorative feature rather than a functional clock with mechanical complexity. The absence of these elements means the model does not feature the described traits of a detailed clock mechanism.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the intricate gothic carvings, including the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements, retain sharp detail and accurate geometry in the miniature model without visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gothic details, such as the rose window and flying buttresses, are depicted with a significant degree of sharpness and geometric accuracy. The intricate carvings are clear, and the proportions appear consistent with gothic architectural designs. This preservation of detail ensures that the model maintains a high level of realism, avoiding issues like blurring or pixelation, thereby presenting a faithful representation of the gothic style in miniature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
