    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows the wings are made of crystal-like shards that are symmetrically aligned. The shards appear structurally coherent, with no visible gaps or misaligned facets. This gives the impression of a well-designed and cohesive wing structure. There are no signs of distorted geometry, which is typical in digital renderings of crystal-like structures. The symmetry preserves the elegance and desired aesthetic which suggests meticulous editing.",
