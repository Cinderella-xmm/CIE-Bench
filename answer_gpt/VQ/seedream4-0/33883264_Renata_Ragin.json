    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed towers retain the original stone texture and structural lines, and are they shaped into arms without geometric distortion or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed towers are integrated into the golem's arms, retaining a stone-like texture similar to the Brooklyn Bridge. This transformation maintains the structural lines and appearance of the original towers. The arms are shaped naturally without noticeable geometric distortions or unnatural breaks, blending well with the golem's body. This conclusion is drawn by observing the continuity of texture and structure from the towers to the arms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suspension cables rendered as continuous, sinewy tendons with consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest area, without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suspension cables are repurposed as sinewy tendons for the golem. They appear continuous and maintain a consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest, similar to the original cables on the Brooklyn Bridge in Image A. There are no signs of fraying or abrupt changes in thickness, indicating a coherent transformation that utilizes the cables' original features effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower transformed into a crown with clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally and are positioned directly above the golem’s head without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Freedom Tower is transformed into a crown with prominent crystal-like facets that reflect light, giving it a realistic appearance. These crystal surfaces appear naturally positioned directly above the golem's head, demonstrating careful alignment without floating or disruption. This transformation effectively uses the original tower's prominence and shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers seamlessly integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers are integrated into the golem's body, functioning as armor plating. This integration is seamless, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges. The buildings' features, such as windows and texture, contribute to the armor's design, creating a cohesive look with the golem's structure. This assessment is based on the direct observation of the integration and harmony between the skyscrapers and the golem's body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the golem’s base fully anchored to the ground and water, with no floating or disconnected limbs, and does its overall scale match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the golem standing firmly on the ground and water, with its base appearing anchored without any floating or disconnected limbs. The scale of the golem matches the surrounding environment, as it towers above the Brooklyn Bridge and adjacent skyscrapers in a believable manner. This evaluation considers the golem's integration into the landscape and its proportional impact on surrounding landmarks.",
