    "Question": "Q3: Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the path starts at the base of the tart and seamlessly continues into the forest background. This path maintains consistent shading and perspective relative to the other elements in the scene, showing continuity without sharp edges or segments that appear out of place.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
    "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image A features standard cheese tarts, while Image B showcases a tart with cartoon additions. The tart in Image B maintains its foundational shape and structure, with no evidence of destructive edits or distortions. The alterations are additive (artistic face), respecting the tart's form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
