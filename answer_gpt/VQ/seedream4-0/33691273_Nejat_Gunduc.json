    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the man’s head position and hand placement near his ear form a plausible and anatomically correct pose that conveys a contemplative state without distortion or unnatural joint angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's head is tilted slightly forward, and his hand is near his ear, suggesting a posture typical of someone deep in thought. The angles of the neck, shoulders, and arm appear natural and consistent with typical human anatomy when contemplating. There's no evidence of distortion or awkward joint angles, making the pose convincing for a contemplative state.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the new background elements (urban structures, lighting, and text) visually consistent with the monochrome tone and do they blend naturally without abrupt edges or conflicting textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an urban setting with street lighting and a billboard. The monochrome color palette of Image B is consistently applied across these new elements, ensuring visual cohesiveness. The textures and lighting do not exhibit harsh edges or noticeable texture clashes, aligning well with the noir theme of the setting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles properly aligned with the man’s head, drawn with consistent line quality, and free from pixelation or overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubble appears positioned directly above the man's head and slightly to the side, a typical placement for thought bubbles. The bubble is drawn with smooth, consistent lines and integrates seamlessly with the overall image quality, maintaining clarity without distortions or pixelation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man’s figure cast a consistent shadow or interact with the billboard surface in a way that preserves spatial depth and avoids floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a clear interaction between the man's figure and the surrounding elements. The lighting suggests a ground reflection matching the street lamp, while the spatial relationship with the billboard maintains a realistic perspective, avoiding a disjointed or floating appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the man’s knit cap, jacket, and facial features preserved with clear definition and no visible artifacting or over-smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the man's clothing are detailed and exhibit a realistic appearance without signs of over-smoothing. The knit cap, jacket fabric, and skin features maintain a natural texture indicative of a high-quality image, avoiding any digital artifacts that could detract from the image quality.",
