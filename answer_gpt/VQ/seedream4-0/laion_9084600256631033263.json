      "question": "Does the glass bottle form retain the original carâ€™s side profile and curvature without visible warping or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the glass bottle form visibly maintains the original car's side profile and curvature. The glass material does not appear to induce any warping or disproportionate scaling, as the dimensions and proportions align well with typical automotive design similar to Image A. The smooth and consistent shape reflects well on the vehicle's original form.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features faceted glass stoppers inserted in positions akin to the headlights on Image A. The surrounding reflection patterns on the glass harmoniously align, and they display consistent lighting, indicating deliberate design to replicate the appearance of headlights with appropriate reflection patterns.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the gear-shaped lid is seen positioned centrally atop the roof area. The connection appears seamless and secure, eliminating any impression of floating edges or disconnection from the glass bottle's body. The placement and attachment ensure consistency with the original car's integrity and proportion.",

      "question": "Is the embossed Datsun emblem clearly visible on the front of the glass bottle and does it maintain proper depth and clarity without surface distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the Datsun emblem on the glass bottle's front, clear and well-rendered. The depth and clarity are preserved adequately, without any surface distortion. This matches the emblem's iconic presentation in Image A, and the glass medium does not hinder the visibility or integrity of the lettering.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B closely, the glass body manifests natural reflections and highlights smoothly, without abrupt shifts or any artificial sheen that might negate realism. The reflections suit the glass material, demonstrating elegance akin to well-crafted glassware and parallel reflections to original highlights present in Image A.",
