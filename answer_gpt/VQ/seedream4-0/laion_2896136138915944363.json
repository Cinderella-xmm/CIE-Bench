      "question": "Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper illustration shows a natural posture and body proportions. The wings are aligned to the torso, and the legs are symmetrically positioned beneath the body. The illustration has been applied to the packaging without alterations affecting posture or proportions, indicative of a correct depiction compared to regular bird anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the packaging surface uniform in pattern and color, with no repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions between areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays packaging with textures that mimic a natural, uniform pattern typical for cardboard surfaces. The patterns do not show repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions, maintaining a coherent and consistent appearance overall.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" fully visible, correctly aligned, and rendered with smooth edges without jagged lines or transparency artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' is fully visible, aligned properly, and appears to be smooth without any noticeable jagged lines or artifacts that would suggest transparency issues. The design maintains the quality usually expected for packaging text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visually, Image B depicts wave patterns at the bottom of the packaging that have continuous, flowing curves. There are no visible gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions, allowing the pattern to maintain a smooth and connected appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the binocular-shaped cut-out window properly shaped with smooth contours, and does it show a clear, non-distorted view of internal kit components without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the binocular-shaped cut-out window has smooth contours and displays components inside the packaging without any distortion or misplacement. The binocular model visible through the window appears correctly positioned and consistent with expected packaging design standards.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandpiper illustration integrated smoothly with the surrounding packaging elements. There are no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities, which indicates a seamless design transition between different elements of the packaging.",
