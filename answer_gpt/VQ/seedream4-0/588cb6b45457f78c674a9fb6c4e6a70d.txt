    "Question": "Q7: Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the original face, with no stretching or warping caused by adjacent edits?",
    "explanation": "While the facial details are blurred, the assessment focuses on ensuring adjacent edits do not cause undue distortion to alignment. Considering the rest of the edits maintain integrity in positioning and proportionality, there's a reasonable inference that symmetry is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
