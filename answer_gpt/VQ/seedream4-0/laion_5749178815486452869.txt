    "Question": "Q1: Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floating green field has a distinct and clean outline, seeming to float in the starry background without any visible distortions or broken geometry. This effect is consistent with the surreal landscape style, where floating islands or layers are often crafted to appear as self-contained units. The smooth edges and absence of any breaks make it appear designed intentionally to float above the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases yellow and red flowers with vivid color, and upon examination, there are no visible unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals. The design maintains consistent texture details, and edges are sharp without any color overlapping or fringing effects, contributing to a polished visual presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the apple appears prominently larger than the geometric tree and is positioned to emphasize its size. The shading and texture details are consistent with that of a real apple, featuring highlights and shadows that give it a three-dimensional fruit-like appearance. This is an intentional design choice to create a surreal effect in the sky while maintaining realism in the object's portrayal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and butterfly are stylized while maintaining identifiable characteristics such as wing shapes and body proportions. The contours of both insects are smooth, without any anatomical deformities or fragmented parts. The design ensures that these figures can be recognized easily despite the style adaptation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
    "explanation": "Image B replaces the more realistic tree seen in Image A with a hollow, angular geometric form. This new element features clean lines and internal voids aligning with surreal artistic style, maintaining structural integrity that avoids fragmentation, ensuring it looks physically plausible within the context of the surreal visual composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
