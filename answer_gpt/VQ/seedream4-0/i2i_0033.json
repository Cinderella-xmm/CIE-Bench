      "question": "Does the person retain a natural jumping pose that aligns with typical human biomechanics, avoiding any distortion or unnatural posturing?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the person shows a dynamic and exaggerated jumping pose typical of stylized art forms. The bent arms and legs and the forward thrust of the body capture motion and energy. Despite the artistic liberties taken, the pose aligns with human biomechanics and does not exhibit any obvious distortions or anatomical impossibilities.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
