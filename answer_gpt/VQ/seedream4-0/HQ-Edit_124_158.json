      "question": "Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is seated on a throne-like chair within an elaborate setting. The proportions of the cat's body, such as its head, belly, and limbs, appear natural and consistent with a healthy-sized cat. The pose, with a slightly leaned back position and a relaxed demeanor, contributes to a realistic and anatomically correct representation. The catâ€™s proportions do not show signs of digital manipulation like stretching, compression, or obvious deformation. The analysis involves recognizing standard anatomical features and confirming their presence intact.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a throne that is a complex piece with both velvet and wood materials. The texture of the velvet is visually soft and detailed, indicating a realistic rendering. The wooden parts of the throne, especially the carved details on the legs and the back, are well-defined and maintain realistic shading and texture. There are no visible pixelation, mismatched shading, or seams that would disrupt the visual integrity of the materials or suggest artificial editing errors.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet curtains in Image B are depicted hanging beside the throne, with a natural flow and fold patterns that imply a dense and plush fabric. The soft shadows created by these folds contribute to the curtains' depth and realistic appearance. The edges of the curtains appear to fall naturally without any indication of floating or misalignment. This analysis is based on recognizing the typical behavior of heavy fabrics and ensuring they maintain realistic interaction with the surrounding space.",

      "question": "Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gilded columns are positioned symmetrically at the sides of the throne. They are scaled appropriately to fit the scene, aligning well with the perspective of the room. The reflective metallic surfaces of the columns catch ambient light accurately, displaying highlights and reflections consistent with gold. There are no artifacts like blurring or jagged edges, which ensures they visually integrate well into the scene.",

      "question": "Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows small framed portraits of mice hanging above the throne. These portraits are of an appropriate size relative to other elements in the scene, maintaining visibility and context. The string attachments appear realistic, and the shadows cast by the frames are consistent with the scene's lighting. No visual glitches or texture errors are apparent, suggesting professional rendering emulating physical attachments and shadows accurately.",
