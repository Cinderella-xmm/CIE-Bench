      "question": "Does the small flag reading 'Fresh' appear naturally placed on top of the sandwich without looking out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flag is inserted into the sandwich and appears upright without noticeable distortion. The size and angle are consistent with what would be expected if a flag were naturally placed into a sandwich. The text 'Fresh' is clear and readable, which supports a natural appearance.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the sandwich consistent after replacing the tomato slices with grilled pineapple, preserving the natural structure and layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sandwich layers with the grilled pineapple replacing the tomato slices. The lettuce, turkey slices, and mayo appear unchanged and maintain the initial layering structure. The inclusion of pineapple instead of tomato preserves the sandwich's general appearance, indicating consistency.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the replacement of tomato slices with grilled pineapple, Image B presents the sandwich in a way that appears structurally coherent. The elements, including the bun, lettuce, turkey, and pineapple, are well-aligned, supporting the sandwich's authenticity without appearing edited.",
