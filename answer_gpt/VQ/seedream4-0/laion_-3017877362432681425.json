      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gullwing doors of the car have been transformed into a design mimicking the shoulder buttons of a game controller. These elements retain the symmetric placement reminiscent of car doors. The edited shape is smoothly integrated into the overall design, and there are no indications of warping or clipping in the transitions from the body to the button-like structures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual aspect of Image B displays a redesign where the grille now resembles a D-pad typical in game controllers. The segments are regularly spaced and positioned under the Mercedes emblem, maintaining alignment without any overlapping or missing sections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic red hue is consistently applied to the entire structure, demonstrating smooth gloss highlights that adhere to the contours of the controller-like design. These highlights appear realistic with ambient reflections, showing no abrupt changes or flat sections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No central control button or emblem detail is evident on the controller-like surface in Image B in the traditional dashboard area of a car. Instead, the design symbolizes tension between automotive and electronics, without visible shading or displacement issues.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the car’s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the Mercedes logo as part of the controller’s surface, positioned similarly to the hood of a car. It retains defined edges and consistent depth, remaining aligned centrally without any tilting or distortion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all components such as shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, and hood logo seamlessly integrate into the overall structure, showing no signs of floating or misalignment. There are no unnatural bends that suggest detachment.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited regions in Image B, including the door edges, grille perimeter, and hood logo, do not exhibit visual artifacts such as jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections. The transitions and boundaries are smooth and cohesive.",
