    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner is depicted with a holographic and metallic surface on the packaging. The highlights and reflections appear smoothly integrated across the surface, considering typical lighting effects where reflections would align with a primary light source, enhancing realism without causing patchiness. The use of color gradients also suggests intentional design rather than random shine.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scannerâ€™s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front panel includes holographic elements that seem to project from the scanner, with a glowing effect and visual depth hinting at an LED-style addition. The colors and glow align with the contours of the scanner rather than a flat overlay, suggesting depth and integration with the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the grid lines on the holographic floor are evenly spaced and match the perspective projected by the scanner. The lines maintain a continuous flow, avoiding jagged interruptions or mismatched alignment, which suggests they were thoughtfully integrated into the holographic design with consideration for spatial orientation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, tech-themed icons are placed on the side of the packaging box. They are properly scaled and placed on the right side, ensuring they do not interfere with the main scanner components such as the control panel or the paper path, allowing for clear presentation of branding without obstruction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparison, Image B shows the scanner incorporated in the packaging design without altering the spatial relationship of its components. The paper feed slot and control panel area retain their positions akin to Image A, ensuring no distortion or misalignment in dimensions within the visual design on the box.",
    "answer": "Yes"
