      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cartoon version of the man have correctly proportioned limbs, five fingers per hand, and natural joint angles without bending or elongation errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon version of the man is a simplified, stylized rendering typical of cartoon characters. Such representations often have exaggerated features and may not adhere strictly to anatomical proportions. However, in this case, despite simplification, the limbs appear to maintain reasonable proportions for the style used, and the hands appear to have the correct number of fingers. The joint angles appear natural within the cartoon style, which aligns with standard cartoon conventions that balance stylization with recognizability.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the swirling leaves positioned in a way that follows logical airflow paths and do not intersect or pass through the man’s body or bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling leaves are illustrated with a visual effect that suggests motion around the man. The leaves form circular patterns around him, reinforcing the idea of swirling air. This alignment is typical in illustrations and does not realistically pass through the body or bench, adhering to conventional artistic interpretations of motion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree canopies and foliage display consistent color distribution and intact branching structures without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses cartoon motifs, where simplified and stylized leaves and branches are depicted with consistent colors within the cartoon pages. These elements are not directly analyzed here as it focuses on the cream-colored paper background. However, the description refers to the cartoon rendering, where artistic impressions are stylistically consistent with cartoon norms rather than realistic foliage depiction.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cream-colored paper background uniformly textured and do the tree branch motifs lie flat without distortion, clipping, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cream-colored paper background maintains a subtle texture with tree branch motifs. These motifs are depicted flat and symmetrically across the paper’s surface without apparent distortion, clipping errors, or shadowing that would be unnatural in such a layout. This presentation supports the clean and uniform aesthetic typical for cartoon-style illustrations in a book.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the elements (man, leaves, bench, paper border) arranged within clear margins and aligned symmetrically or logically to suggest a bounded page layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases its elements neatly arranged within clear margins, suggesting a book-like layout. The man, leaves, and paper border are placed systematically, with each illustration occupying defined compartments within the page. This arrangement supports a balanced and logical layout, common in printed and illustrated material for visual consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all surfaces (clothing, skin, leaves, paper) rendered with consistent sharpness and texture detail without jagged lines, smudging, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces, including clothing, skin, leaves, and paper, are rendered consistently within the stylized cartoon framework. The absence of jagged lines, smudging, or unnatural smoothing is adhered to, as these elements are clear with defined outlines typical of cartoon styling, ensuring visual clarity and consistency.",
