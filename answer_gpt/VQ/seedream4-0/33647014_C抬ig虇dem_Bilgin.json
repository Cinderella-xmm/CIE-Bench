      "question": "Does the transformed king have smooth, flowing contours resembling water without jagged edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed king exhibits smooth, flowing contours that resemble water, evident in the continuous and harmonious lines that define the figure. The absence of jagged edges or disconnected fragments suggests a well-executed transformation. Such smoothness indicates that the design adheres to natural contours and movements, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal and fluidity without interruptions.",

      "question": "Are the flame elements on the transformed queen composed of layered, tapering shapes that follow natural fire motion without abrupt transitions or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed queen in Image B showcases flame designs that are composed of layered and tapering shapes, closely mimicking the natural motion and appearance of fire. This is evident from the way the flames rise and taper smoothly from the base, creating a dynamic and natural effect. The absence of abrupt transitions or pixelated edges further supports that the design effectively represents flames with elegance and precision.",

      "question": "Do the transformed knights display consistent stone texture with clear carving lines and no distorted proportions or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knights in Image B possess a consistent stone texture, with clear and distinct carving lines that exemplify the solidity and coherence expected of a stone material. These aspects are crucial for maintaining authenticity in design. Additionally, the proportions of the knight figures are well-maintained, with no evidence of distortion or floating fragments, indicating a realistic transformation that adheres to the intended theme.",

      "question": "Are the transformed bishops rendered with soft, gradient edges and flowing lines that suggest motion without visible pixelation or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bishops in Image B are characterized by soft, gradient edges and flowing lines that convey motion. This is achieved by the smooth transitions in color and shape, lending to a dynamic visual effect. The absence of visible pixelation or ghosting demonstrates a high-quality rendering process that prioritizes smoothness and fluidity, making their movement appear natural and seamless.",

      "question": "Do the transformed pawns show uniform glow without haloing or blurred outlines that separate them from the board?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pawns in Image B present a uniform glow that remains consistent throughout, without any haloing or blurred outlines that could disconnect them from the board. This uniformity ensures that the pawns are visually integrated with their surroundings, maintaining continuity and clarity in their presentation despite the inherent luminosity.",

      "question": "Does the transformed rook feature a tree trunk with visible bark texture and legible runes without stretching or warping of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed rook in Image B displays a tree trunk design, with a bark texture that is prominently visible and enhances the natural feel of the piece. The runes engraved on the trunk are distinct and legible, which ensures thematic coherence. There is no evidence of structural stretching or warping, indicating that the transformation has been executed with care for maintaining the integrity and aesthetics of the design.",

      "question": "Do the shadows beneath all transformed pieces align with the light direction and object height, without appearing detached or incorrectly sized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the transformed pieces align appropriately with the light source and object heights. They are consistent with the directionality of light, ensuring that the shadows do not appear detached or incorrectly sized. This alignment is crucial for achieving a realistic and integrated depiction of the scene, securing the pieces firmly on the board.",
