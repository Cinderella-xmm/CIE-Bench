    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the crystal shards appear to be evenly placed along the ribs of the cactus. Their distribution seems consistent, and no gaps or overlapping clusters are visible, as typical symmetry and regularity in designs can suggest an intentional pattern. This indicates careful placement along the cactus ribs, ensuring a uniform appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glyphs are positioned directly along the lines of the cactus ribs, showing consistency with the shape and structure of the cactus. The glow they emit is soft, maintaining the visibility of both the glyphs and cactus surface without excessive light dispersion that could cause overexposure or haloing. This reflects a well-adjusted luminous effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
    "explanation": "From the visuals in Image B, the base of the pedestal appears firmly positioned on the wooden surface. The texture of the sandstone and wood is well-rendered, showing realistic grounding without any signs of detachment like floating or raw edges. This natural continuity between the objects lends realism to the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the amber eyes are symmetrically embedded along the ribs of the cactus, maintaining uniformity around the structure. The eyes exhibit an internal shine, which enhances the visual effect without altering or distorting the adjacent cactus features. Such placement suggests a design focus on symmetry and visual integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts vine tendrils that wrap with natural curves around the pedestal. The connection appears seamless, smoothly adhering to the base, which is a characteristic of realistic vine distribution, avoiding unnatural floatation or stiffness. The vines integrate naturally, indicating careful attention to design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
