    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the atom illustration placed in the same location as the original dough and does it have a smooth, continuous edge without jagged lines or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the atom illustration appears in the same position as in Image A, with both images presenting the dough with an atom imprint alongside an atom-shaped cookie cutter on a wooden background. The edges of the atom illustration in Image B are smooth and continuous, showcasing clean lines synonymous with a properly fabricated cookie imprint.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the additional atom-shaped cookies the same size as the original dough and do they have colors that blend naturally with the beige dough and wooden background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are small additional atom-shaped cookies placed on top of the larger dough. They possess bright colors (blue, yellow, pink) contrasting with the beige dough and wooden background. These cookies are smaller compared to the entire dough, which emphasizes the atom imprint. Therefore, they do not blend seamlessly with the background but stand out as decorative additions.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arrows point directly to the correct parts of the atom (electrons, protons, neutrons) without crossing over or distorting the atomic shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features arrows pointing to different areas labeled with atomic terminology. The arrow labeled 'electrons' correctly points to the ring-like shape around the atom. The labels 'protons' and 'neutrons' correspond to smaller cookie placements, suggesting accurate linking contrary to distortion. None of the arrows interfere with or cross over the atomic illustration, thus maintaining an orderly depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the title text \"Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry\" clearly visible, positioned above the illustrations, and does it not overlap with the atom shapes or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'Atoms & Cookies: A Sweet Chemistry' is prominently positioned at the top center, above the illustrations. The visibility is enhanced by its white text color, contrasting the wooden background, and it does not overlap with any part of the atom shapes or the cookie cutter, thus maintaining clarity and distinctiveness from the rest of the elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dotted lines straight, uniformly spaced, and positioned between sections without covering the atom illustrations or cookie cutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dotted lines are curvilinear but uniformly spaced, traversing the scene without obscuring key visual elements such as the atom illustration or cookie cutter. They serve to guide the viewer's eye between sections without interfering with the integrity of the main visuals. Thus, while not straight, they fulfill the intent of separate delineations neatly.",
