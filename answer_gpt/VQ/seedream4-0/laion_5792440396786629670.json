    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the castle icon used for the HOMEPAGE positioned centrally and sized proportionally to fit within the original white rounded rectangle area without overlapping nearby elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle icon is located within the designated area for the HOMEPAGE. It is well-centered and fits proportionally within the rounded rectangle area meant for the HOMEPAGE, indicating careful alignment. The castle does not overlap with the adjacent elements such as the pathways leading to other sections. This is deduced by observing the placement of the castle in relation to surrounding items and its harmonious fit within the graphics, suggesting it is positioned as intended without errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the connection lines between the HOMEPAGE and main sections (e.g., PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US) transformed into smooth, winding trails with no broken segments or irregular widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features connection paths represented as winding trails instead of straight lines. These trails have consistent widths and there are no visible breaks or irregularities, as the paths flow smoothly from the HOMEPAGE to different sections of the site. The transformation to trails is indicated by the continuous flow and natural curves connecting sections, showing a deliberate design choice for aesthetics and thematic uniformity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the icon replacing \"PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS\" clearly visible, properly aligned within the orange rounded rectangle, and appropriately scaled so it doesn't extend beyond the border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS' has been replaced with an icon. This icon is positioned neatly within the orange rounded rectangle and is scaled to fit well, not extending beyond the border. This is verified by examining its containment within the rectangle and the symmetry of its placement, suggesting it was intended to be centrally aligned and visually comfortable.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (e.g., trees, creatures) placed along the winding trails in gaps between nodes and do they have smooth outlines and consistent coloring without jagged edges or noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, decorative elements such as trees, creatures, and paths appear along the trails. These elements are located in gaps where spaces between nodes allow. Their outlines are smooth and the coloring is consistent, without noise or jagged edges, enhancing the visual coherence and thematic appeal of the design. This conclusion comes from observing the edges, colors, and overall clarity of the drawings, which align well with a whimsical and visually neat theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the text in the blue rounded rectangles (e.g., \"News\", \"Events\") use a consistent, bold, child-friendly font that remains fully contained within the bounds of each shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in blue rounded rectangles in Image B appears to use a child-friendly font that is bold and visually consistent across each label like 'News' and 'Events'. The font is appropriately sized so the text remains within the bounds of the blue rectangles, as evidenced by the absence of overflow or misplacement, which shows careful design adherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the different levels of the site map (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) still visually separable based on color coding or size differences, despite the change in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the style change in Image B, the different levels of the site map are marked visibly by distinct colors. The orange, blue, brown, etc., rounded rectangles keep the color-coded scheme intact which maintains the differentiation visually. An analysis of the color scheme and spatial separation demonstrates clear visual markers for the varying levels, maintaining their distinctive properties despite thematic changes.",
