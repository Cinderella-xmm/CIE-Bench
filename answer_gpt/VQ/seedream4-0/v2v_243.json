      "question": "Do the transformed skis and hockey sticks maintain their original structural integrity and proportions as footwear, avoiding any unnatural distortions or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis have been transformed into footwear, specifically boots, maintaining a visually cohesive design with no noticeable distortions or structural integrity issues. The patterns from the skis appear on the boots, which are proportionate and appropriately shaped for footwear, maintaining a natural geometric form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vivid patterns and wooden textures from the original skis and hockey sticks naturally incorporated into the footwear design without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vivid patterns of the skis are seamlessly incorporated into the design of the boots, preserving the original artistic detail. The wooden textures of the hockey sticks are not present in the boots, suggesting a material change to suit footwear. There are no unnatural textures or noticeable loss of detail in the visible patterns of the footwear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition from skis and hockey sticks to footwear appear logical and plausible, maintaining the visual credibility of both the original and new forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of the skis into boots maintains a plausible aesthetic, as the ski patterns integrate well into the boot design and the form naturally transitions to a footwear shape. Though the hockey sticks remain unchanged in Image B, the focus is on the skis, which serve as the primary element of transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the original skis and hockey sticks been preserved in the new footwear design, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boots in Image B retain the intricate and vivid patterns seen on the skis in Image A, suggesting that fine details are preserved in the transformation. The wooden textures of the hockey sticks, although prominent in Image A, are not applicable to this analysis as they do not transform into footwear. Thus, the patterns from the skis are well-preserved without noticeable loss of detail.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the new footwear design respect the physical properties and proportions of the original skis and hockey sticks, avoiding any distortion or damage to geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis have been transformed into a boot design that respects the overall physical proportions and geometry expected of footwear. The vibrant ski patterns wrap around the boots logically without distortion. The hockey sticks remain outside this transformation, maintaining their original properties without any geometric changes.",
