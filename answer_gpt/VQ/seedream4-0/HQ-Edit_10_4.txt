    "Question": "Q1: Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial area is intentionally blurred, so it is challenging to assess the consistency of the wood texture, the natural grain patterns, or the maintenance of facial proportions. The blur obscures any analysis regarding surface depth or the presence of distortions.",
