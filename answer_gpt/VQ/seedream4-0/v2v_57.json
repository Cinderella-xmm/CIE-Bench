      "question": "Do the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal appear to naturally integrate with the warm red and gold hues of the book and pitcher without disrupting the overall color harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Classic LEGO minifigure is adorned in red and black, while the mythical animal has vibrant red and gold. Both these color palettes integrate harmoniously with the existing warm red tones of the book and golden hues of the pitcher. This integration creates a cohesive color scheme that does not seem discordant or out of place, which is achieved by mutual warm undertones in both the original and edited images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and sizes of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal logically consistent with the scale of the book and pitcher, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal inside a transparent cube are presented as significantly smaller than the book and the pitcher. This does not break any natural scaling or proportion rules expected in a typical display case setting. Although they are smaller, this size difference seems consistent and intentional, appropriate for the presentation within a display, in contrast to how objects were placed in Image A.",

      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal maintain a natural and high-quality appearance, free from any unnatural artifacts or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal display a smooth, polished texture that is characteristic of LEGO figures. The details, such as the facial features of the minifigure and the intricate design on the mythical animal, are clear and sharp. There are no visible artifacts, suggesting that they maintain a natural and high-quality appearance consistent with the standard of LEGO products.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosing the scene preserve its structural integrity and visual plausibility, without introducing any broken geometric shapes or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube in Image B appears to have clean lines, consistent thickness, and natural reflections that do not distort the scene inside. The edges are straight without any indication of breakage or warped geometry. This visual ensures that the glass cube looks plausible as a display case, maintaining its structural integrity.",

      "question": "Does the gradient background transition smoothly from deep amber to soft cream tones, enhancing the cozy ambiance without disrupting the visual authenticity and natural appearance of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B transitions softly from a deep amber near the top to a lighter cream shade at the bottom. This creates a warm backdrop that complements the red and gold colors of the foreground elements, maintaining the same cozy ambiance as observed in Image A. The gradient is smooth and does not have any harsh or abrupt color transitions, thus preserving the visual authenticity and natural appearance of the scene.",
