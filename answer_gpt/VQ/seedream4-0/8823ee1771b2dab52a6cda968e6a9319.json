      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the figurine’s face maintain correct anatomical proportions with no visible warping or misshapen features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's face is not visible due to blurring; consequently, it's not possible to accurately assess proportions or any potential warping or misshaping. The face itself is crafted in a classical style, typical of porcelain figures, suggesting that it may follow standard proportions but without direct evidence due to the blur. Overall, given that porcelain figures are usually designed to look aesthetically pleasing, it is reasonable to assume the face would maintain correct proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the folds of the dress rendered with smooth, continuous surfaces resembling glazed porcelain, without cracked or fragmented areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears very smooth with a glossy finish, indicative of glazed porcelain. The folds are continuous and without visible signs of cracking or fragmentation, which is characteristic of high-quality porcelain work. This suggests that the rendering process aimed to replicate the shiny, flawless surface of porcelain.",

      "question": "Is the hand positioned correctly on the column with natural contact and no floating or clipped fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine’s hand is placed on the column, and from the visual cues, it appears to be positioned naturally without any fingers appearing to float or be clipped. The hand seems to rest comfortably on the column, indicating correctly modeled contact.",

      "question": "Do the decorative patterns on the mantle and column appear clearly defined and scaled down appropriately for a miniature setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the mantle and column display decorative patterns that are precise and detailed, suitable for a miniature portrayal. The patterns are distinct and maintain clarity, which indicates they were carefully scaled down to fit the smaller dimensions typically associated with a porcelain figurine.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is well-integrated into the surroundings. The lighting on the figurine matches the scene’s overall lighting, and the perspective does not appear distorted. The base aligns with nearby objects, maintaining visual consistency, which suggests careful attention to detail in the edited scene file.",
