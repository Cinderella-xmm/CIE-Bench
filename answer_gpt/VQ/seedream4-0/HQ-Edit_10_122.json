      "question": "Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a patterned textile that appears to be inspired by vibrant African fabrics, likely Ankara or similar designs. The pattern on the character’s top includes geometric shapes with rich colors that blend well, resembling traditional motifs seen in African attire. The visual traits—sharp geometric shapes with vivid colors—imply a high-quality artistic representation, suggesting no distortions or repeating digital artifacts.",

      "question": "Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates umbrellas in the background with consistent proportions and spatial relationships. The umbrellas are correctly aligned relative to the depicted market scene, consistent with a market environment. Their positioning in space does not contradict common visual logic, demonstrating plausible spatial arrangement and adherence to identifiable market scenes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s right hand is depicted with all five fingers, demonstrating realistic proportions and curvature typical of a human hand. The skin texture is consistent with the rest of the character’s arm, showing no signs of digital mishaps like duplication or distortion, thereby maintaining a realistic portrayal.",
