      "question": "Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes have been extended outward into the field, creating a surreal effect where the stripes blend into the grass. Upon analysis, it becomes evident that the stripes do not seamlessly blend into the grass as the transition area between the stripes and grass is quite distinctive and the grass appears to unnaturally protrude from the black and white stripes. This creates a visual break that disrupts the natural flow and texture of the grassy field.",

      "question": "Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stripes in Image B have been extended to form a pattern radiating outwards from the zebra. While this design might echo the zebra's original pattern, the extension affects the geometric integrity by transforming the stripes into a radial design on the ground, differing from the linear stripes on the zebra's body. Thus, the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's stripes are not preserved in this extension.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the surreal extension of the stripes, the zebra stands prominently in the foreground, grazing, which naturally keeps it as the focal point of the image. The bold pattern created by the extended stripes does add a strong visual element, but the zebra's clear presence and central position in the composition help to maintain it as the focal point.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key features of the zebra, including its mane, ears, and legs, remain clearly visible and appear natural. The edit primarily affects the ground surrounding the zebra, leaving the animal itself visually intact and untouched by any unnatural distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the zebra's body itself remains detailed with sharply defined stripes, the surreal extension on the ground does not maintain the same level of detail. The grass appears to project through the added stripe pattern, leading to visual artifacts where the stripes intersect with the natural texture of the grass. This suggests a degradation in the details around the area of the extension.",
