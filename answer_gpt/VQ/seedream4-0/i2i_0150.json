    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or visible edges where the forest background was replaced with the city balcony and skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been changed from a forest scene to a city skyline. By examining the edges where the bird meets the new background, there are no visible signs of artificial manipulation, such as mismatched lighting, inconsistent edge sharpness, or unnatural blending. The transition appears smooth and natural, indicating a well-executed edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bird and the branch it stands on blend well with the city balcony setting, maintaining their structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird remains unchanged structurally; however, the branch it originally stood on has been replaced with a metal railing, more appropriate for a city setting. The editing ensures that the bird has a natural stance connected to the railing without awkward cropping or unnatural overlapping, maintaining visual credibility.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the texture and structure of the branch remained intact and undistorted after replacing the forest background with a city balcony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the branch has been entirely replaced by a city balcony railing. As such, the original structure of the branch is no longer present. Thus, the question of whether the branch's structure remains intact is irrelevant, as it has been substituted completely.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and relative sizes of the bird, branch, and city skyline appear physically plausible and natural in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is sitting on a metal railing with a city skyline in the background. The bird maintains a size proportional to what one would expect in such a scene, sitting on a balcony railing with an appropriately blurred skyline to suggest distance. Hence, the proportions and positioning look plausible and natural.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shadow play on the bird, branch, and cityscape match naturally, contributing to the overall realism of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the bird and its reflection on the railing suggest a coherent lighting source, consistent with the lighting of the city skyline background. The image captures the transitional lighting conditions well, resulting in a cohesive and realistic composition.",
