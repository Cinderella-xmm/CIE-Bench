    "Question": "Q1: Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent is constructed to appear as a continuous, smooth form without any visible misalignments in the bead segments. The curvature flows naturally, much like a real serpent's body would, suggesting a conscious arrangement to mimic natural movement. This indicates careful alignment of the segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blue circular elements are located at the head of the serpent, positioned symmetrically to suggest eyes. They are integrated into the surface, fitting naturally within the design of the head, which gives them a realistic appearance as part of the serpent, rather than appearing disconnected.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the black tribal markings curve and flow with the body of the serpent, lending to a natural appearance. There aren't any sharp or unnaturally repetitive patterns that would suggest digital artifacting. The markings appear to conform to the shape and movement of the serpent's body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tail of the serpent is crafted to taper from the body smoothly, resembling a natural serpent's tail. It ends with small bead-like tips that are arranged in a way suggesting movement, adding continuity to the overall structure and maintaining the snake-like flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface texture of the serpent's body is consistent with a slightly glossy appearance, akin to the original beads seen in Image A. There are no inconsistent material properties such as over-shine or excessive roughness that would indicate unnatural modifications.",
    "answer": "Yes"
