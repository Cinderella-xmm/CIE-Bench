    "Question": "Q1: Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe retains a depiction that aligns with common visual interpretations of silk fabric. It showcases gold highlights and floral patterns, but they are stylized rather than reflecting a realistic interaction of light with material properties. This results in a more simplistic and illustrated appearance, lacking the depth and sheen typically associated with real silk fabric. Therefore, the representation does not fully adhere to realistic material properties.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the book in a stylized manner, with outlines and color fills characteristic of illustration rather than realism. The book's pages are depicted without realistic depth or layers; their comic-like style omits finer structural details that would be present in a real book's pages or edges.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
    "explanation": "Image B retains the alignment and spacing of the bookshelf from Image A but transitions to a more illustrated style with decorative elements such as teacup illustrations and ornate panels that do not adhere to realistic wood grain textures or design integrity. Therefore, while fundamental alignment remains intact, the realism of structural design is compromised by the illustrative elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarks are illustrated above the books on the shelf, not inserted within a book. They lack a direct indication of being inserted between pages, suggesting a decorative purpose rather than functional interaction. This makes their placement more symbolic than practical.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",
    "explanation": "This question involves facial features, which are intentionally blurred in both Image A and B. Given the provided instruction to exclude the blurred face, it's impossible to assess facial feature proportions, accuracy, or visual plausibility.",
    "answer": "The question is not applicable due to the lack of visible facial features."
