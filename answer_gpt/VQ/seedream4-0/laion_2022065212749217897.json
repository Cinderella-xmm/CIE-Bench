      "question": "Is the head disproportionately large compared to the body but without stretched or compressed facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character design appears to mimic a 'chibi' style, which typically features a very large head in proportion to the smaller body. This art style is characterized by exaggeration, often with a head that is about one-third the size of the body, yet without the distortion of facial features. Each element of the face appears intact and appropriately placed. In conjunction with this style, the body retains a miniature form consistent with the genre, thus achieving the intended exaggerated appearance without stretching or compression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly visible and proportionally accurate despite the enlarged head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates classic chibi characteristics with a larger head size that maintains facial feature clarity. Despite the proportionally large head, the facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth are purposefully positioned and sized for the chibi style's playful aesthetic. While the facial specifics are blurred here, in standard context, this design would ensure clarity and proportions that suit the overall artistic representation.",

      "question": "Do the stripes on the shirt maintain consistent width, alignment, and color accuracy across the collar and chest area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt in Image B exhibits precise detailing. The stripes, characterized by their alternating colors, run smoothly and uniformly across the collar and chest. Their alignment is consistent, maintained without any visual deviations or disturbances in color accuracy. This maintains the integrity of both the pattern and color throughout, fitting seamlessly into the context of an animated or illustrated representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the surface of the figure appear smooth and reflective, with no visible texture artifacts or rough edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines artistic and three-dimensional qualities that offer a smooth, polished, and reflective surface typical of a high-gloss cartoon character keychain or figurine. The visual representation avoids any texture artifacts or rough edges, suggesting a high-quality rendering that highlights the glossy finish observed in luxury toys or collectible figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform pastel color with no gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts near the figure's edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a uniform combination of pastel blue and pink color blocks. These colors are laid sharply without any blending into one another or near the figure's edge, creating a crisp visual that is free from any gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts. This creates a clean, contrasting effect that sets the figure apart as the focal point of the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the facial expression more animated than the original (e.g., wider eyes, open mouth) but still anatomically consistent and not distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the standard attributes of a chibi-style depiction where facial features often seem to have enhanced expressiveness, such features might typically include larger, more vibrant eyes or exaggerated smiles. In Image B, without precise facial feature depiction, the typical chibi art style would indeed strive for an animated look, ensuring consistency in anatomical representation even amidst artistic exaggeration.",
