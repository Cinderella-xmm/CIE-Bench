      "question": "Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome glass case appears to be smooth and clear, showing realistic light interactions. The transparency is consistent, with the light reflecting naturally off its surface, indicating high-quality rendering. There are no visible stitches or warps, which suggests a precise editing job without noticeable flaws. Glass cases typically have a consistent and smooth appearance when rendered properly.",

      "question": "Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings within the dome appear proportionally consistent with one another. The reduction process seems uniform, maintaining the scale relationships between these architectural elements. This proportionality is expected in a real diorama or model where elements are uniformly scaled down.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the added small houses are consistent with the architectural style of the church and other elements. The roofs, windows, and textures appear accurately shaped and aligned with the style seen in traditional European rural architecture. There is no visible deformation, suggesting successful integration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the copper roof of the church tower exhibits a realistic texture with variations, resembling actual copper material. The lighting response is consistent with the way real copper interacts with light, showing signs of oxidation or patina which are common on aged copper roofs. This indicates careful attention to detail in rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mist along the mountains as smoothly diffused. The transitions in opacity are gradual, and there are no abrupt edges or blocky patterns visible. The softness of the mist complements the mountain scene and suggests accurate photographic or rendering techniques.",

      "question": "Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold pedestal is positioned correctly under the base of the diorama, providing a stable foundation. Its appearance is solid and grounded, with no signs of floating or misalignment. Such positioning is necessary for the realistic depiction of a diorama that sits on a pedestal.",

      "question": "Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays terraced vineyards with consistent spacing and natural curvature. The details are smooth without visible grid lines or pixelation, contributing to the realistic and aesthetically pleasing depiction of the landscape typical in vineyard regions.",
