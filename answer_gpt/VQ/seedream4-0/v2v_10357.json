      "question": "Are the shapes of the teddy bear and motorcycle still recognizable after being converted to a low-poly 3-D render style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the conversion to a low-poly style, the basic outline and structure of both the teddy bear and the motorcycle are preserved. This is evident through the identifiable features such as the bear's body shape, its seating position, and the distinct motorcycle shape with identifiable parts like wheels and handlebars. The low-poly style simplifies the form but does not obscure the recognizable shapes of the objects. Therefore, both objects remain recognizable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the teddy bear and motorcycle retain their texture details without appearing overly simplified or losing important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the conversion into a low-poly 3-D render style inherently simplifies the texture details. This style transforms the surface of objects into geometric facets which means texture details are lost, simplifying features like the fur of the teddy bear and the metal of the motorcycle. These now appear more abstract with planar facets rather than detailed textures seen in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the teddy bear and motorcycle consistent with their real-world counterparts, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the proportions appear consistent, with the teddy bear proportionally seated on the motorcycle and the motorcycle maintaining a structurally accurate shape. Image B successfully translates these proportions into the low-poly style without altering the relative sizes or dimensions of the objects, maintaining realistic scaling similar to Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the teddy bear appear naturally seated on the motorcycle, maintaining a believable posture and interaction with the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posture of the teddy bear in Image B matches what appears to be a natural seated position similar to Image A. The integration of the bear's arms gripping the handlebars and positioning on the seat are features that maintain a realistic posture even after the stylistic transformation to low-poly.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scenic background seamlessly integrated with the low-poly 3-D rendered teddy bear and motorcycle, without any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scenic background transforms into the low-poly style, mirroring the aesthetic of the teddy bear and motorcycle. The consistency in style helps integrate the entire scene visually, ensuring no noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies between foreground and background. The transition to low-poly is applied uniformly making the background fit seamlessly with the rendered objects.",
