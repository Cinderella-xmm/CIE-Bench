      "question": "Does the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo appear smooth and well-integrated without any unnatural edges or blurring around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo on the refrigerator door appears sharp and without any visible unnatural edges or signs of blurring. The logo's integration into the door visually matches the surrounding design elements, which suggests it has been edited in a manner consistent with the quality of the image, relying on world knowledge of image editing techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the custom label on the top shelf placed appropriately, without distorting the surrounding items or creating visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the custom label at the top of the refrigerator is placed horizontally above the shelf without interfering with the placement of any items or distorting their appearance. The label does not cause visual inconsistencies or warp the context of the objects nearby, showing it was integrated carefully. By comparing with Image A, we confirm the region was edited but maintained proportionality and alignment consistent with realistic placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the texture and details around the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label consistent with the rest of the refrigerator's surface, avoiding any noticeable loss or alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label blending smoothly into the refrigerator's surface, maintaining the same texture and detail as the untouched areas of the refrigerator. The lack of noticeable discrepancy in color, brightness, or surface details supports the conclusion that these edits were consistent with the overall texture. Comparing with Image A, both logos were added without altering the original surface texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label maintain appropriate scaling relative to their surrounding elements, appearing neither too large nor too small?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label are reasonable within the context of a refrigerator's inside door dimensions and shelf space. The relative size of the logo and label harmonizes with the dimensions of the bottles and jars surrounding them. Upon comparison with Image A, it is clear these edits were made proportional, considering realistic spatial constraints.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shadowing on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label correspond logically to the light source, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label appears consistent with the illumination of the refrigerator interior, with no discrepancies in shadowing or brightness affecting their appearance. The integration with the natural light coming from the window and the refrigerator's lighting contributes to an authentic look. Comparing to Image A confirms that both labels were edited to match the ambient lighting context.",
