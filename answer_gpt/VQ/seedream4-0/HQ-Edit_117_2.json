      "question": "Are the expanded motifs on the dress proportionally consistent with the garment’s structure, and do they avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features vibrant motifs, which are expected to follow the natural flow of the fabric. The expanded motifs appear to be proportionally placed, maintaining the garment’s structure without evidence of improper stretching or interruption of fabric lines, resulting in a coherent and attractive design.",

      "question": "Do the transformed bread and cucumber retain recognizable forms as food items while incorporating character features, without unnatural deformations or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the bread and cucumber have been given character features, such as faces and limbs, but they continue to hold their recognizable shapes as food items. The transformation is well-done, as it introduces character aspects without causing any deformation or texture inconsistencies, thus making them pleasant to perceive both as food and playful characters.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each vignette placement has been precisely executed. There are no elements cut off or edge artifacts which indicate that the postcards are cleanly separated and well-integrated within the image, thanks to careful attention to the boundaries and positioning.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is visible near the stove, showing correct anatomical structure with five fingers. The proportions and positioning are natural and consistent with human hand anatomy. Moreover, the shadow cast by the hand aligns with the lighting in the image, which suggests accurate light source interpretation.",
