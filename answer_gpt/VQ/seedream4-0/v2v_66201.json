      "question": "Does the transition between the Victorian attire and the cosmic dust appear seamless without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Victorian attire seamlessly transitions into cosmic dust, effectively creating an ethereal effect typical of dreamlike surrealism. The attire transforms into cosmic particles without displaying any abrupt changes in texture or conspicuous artifacts. The textures flow into one another naturally, suggesting expert blending techniques.",

      "question": "Are the clockwork tendrils growing from the brass scientific instrument visually plausible and free from unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clockwork tendrils extending from the brass scientific instrument appear to follow the general laws of physics and mechanical design. They are consistent with the object they extend from and do not show signs of digital artifacting or awkward distortions. The tendrils are depicted with a roundness and consistency that make them appear as a plausible yet fantastical extension of the device.",

      "question": "Do the monkey's hands, while subtly distorted, still maintain a natural appearance and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the monkey's hands, though undergoing a surreal distortion as part of the cosmic dust effect, retain their structural consistency. The hands are recognizable with detailed fingers and joints, ensuring the distortion does not compromise the natural appearance of the hands as part of the surreal theme.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the image evoke a dreamlike state characteristic of Surrealism while maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of cosmic elements, the transition from Victorian attire to cosmic dust, and the fantastical clockwork create a surreal and dreamlike ambience. Despite its surreal nature, the image maintains visual credibility through seamless blending and consistency in detail and texture. The composition respects proportions and maintains balance, enhancing the visual storytelling typical of Surrealist art.",

      "question": "Have the transformations preserved the fine details and proportions of the original Victorian attire and brass scientific instrument?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing the original Image A to Image B, despite the transformation, the fine details and proportions of the Victorian attire and brass scientific instrument have been preserved. The attire retains its buttons, fabric texture, and form, while the scientific instrument remains well-defined and proportionate, even with the introduction of clockwork tendrils.",
