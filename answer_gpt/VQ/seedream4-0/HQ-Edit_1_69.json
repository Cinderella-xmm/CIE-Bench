      "question": "Does the red dress maintain natural fabric folds and surface texture despite increased saturation and bold outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress appears to retain the natural fabric folds and surface texture indicative of a layered design, despite the increased saturation and bold outlines. These visual elements enhance the complexity and depth of the dress, suggesting that the editing process focused on amplifying color and contours without flattening the garment's visual dimensionality. This indicates that the dress continues to present realistic folds and texture.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s leg and arm positions consistent with natural human biomechanics during a walking motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s posture reflects a typical walking stance wherein one leg is extended forward and the opposite arm swings in sync with natural human movement patterns, maintaining correct anatomical alignment. Analyzing such posture indicates that these positions display knowledge of biomechanics, imitating the fluidity of human motion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black slipcase visually integrated into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black slipcase is part of a standalone representation of a boxed item alongside an animated version of the scene, separate from the initial environment seen in the walking scene. The slipcase is depicted with a uniform lighting relative to its presentation setting rather than being part of the original street environment, highlighting its integration distinct from the main image's lighting context.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines around the woman’s body follow the natural contours of her shape without creating gaps or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, bold outlines are crafted to accentuate the woman's figure. They closely follow the contours of her body without inconsistency or overlap, effectively reflecting and enhancing her shape. This precise application of lines demonstrates a thoughtful approach to maintaining body contours.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand have five fingers with natural proportions and smooth skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the woman's right hand is rendered with five fingers, maintaining natural proportions that reflect standard human anatomy. The depiction illustrates smooth skin texture without deformities or additional digits, signifying accurate representation of the hand.",
