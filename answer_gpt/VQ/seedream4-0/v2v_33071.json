      "question": "Does the snow on the clock tower appear naturally accumulated without disrupting the structural integrity of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, snow is depicted resting on the ledges and the roof of the clock tower, appearing naturally accumulated without any signs of the structure being compromised. The placement of snow follows common patterns, such as on the flat surfaces where it can naturally collect, and its weight does not seem to negatively impact the tower's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the icy patterns on the flags visually credible and detailed, without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags feature icy patterns and icicles hanging from them. These patterns mimic real-life scenarios where ice forms in colder conditions. The textures are well-integrated with the fabric and do not appear artificial or misplaced.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the clock tower retain their natural appearance despite the added snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock tower in Image B maintains its green and yellow color scheme with a smooth texture visible through the snow. The snow appears naturally placed on the structure, and the underlying material does not seem altered in a way that would suggest artificiality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the clock face and tower preserved without distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the clock face maintaining its circular shape with clearly visible Roman numerals, and the tower's geometry is retained without warping. The snow adds an additional layer but does not interfere with the basic geometric integrity of the tower components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the clock tower and flags been preserved without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details, such as the balustrades of the clock tower and the flag poles in Image B, are well-preserved and appear naturally altered by snow and ice. There is no noticeable loss in detail or the presence of unnatural artifacts introduced by the snow.",
