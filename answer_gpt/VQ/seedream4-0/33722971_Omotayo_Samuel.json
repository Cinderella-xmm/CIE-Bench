      "question": "Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each suitcase has facial features such as eyes, a mouth, or facial expressions that are cleverly integrated into their surfaces without distorting the suitcase geometry. The features appear to be designed to fit the shape of the box, suggesting that they have been added with careful consideration of the natural lines and curves present on each suitcase. The facial features do not disrupt the overall form of the luggage, maintaining a coherent appearance. This is rationalized through common design practices that aim to preserve original shapes while adding aesthetic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the figure have five fingers per hand, with natural hand shape and joint alignment, and no anatomical deformities or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure’s hands in Image B are depicted with five fingers on each hand and showcase a natural hand posture with correctly aligned joints and fingers positioned in biologically plausible angles. The visual analysis confirms the absence of any missing limbs or anatomical deformities, matching expectations based on common human anatomy, indicating well-rendered hand features.",

      "question": "Is the velvet texture applied smoothly across all surfaces without visible seams, repetition, or unnatural lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet texture on the surfaces of Image B appears smooth and consistent, granting a realistic and coherent appearance. The texture is uniformly applied across all visible velvet surfaces without visible seams or repetitive patterns, which would otherwise detract from its visual realism. Lighting reflections on the velvet are natural and consistent with expected behavior of such material. This assessment stems from understanding the appearance and properties of velvet in realistic renderings.",

      "question": "Is the world map backdrop properly aligned with the scene’s perspective and does it integrate seamlessly without warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The world map backdrop in Image B is positioned in line with the scene’s perspective and has been integrated without any noticeable warping or unintended clipping. This is supported by examining the interaction between the map and other elements in the scene, showcasing seamless integration common in well-composed backgrounds tailored to match perspective and depth of field.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the display case fully enclosing the scene with correct proportions, no clipping of elements, and realistic glass transparency or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case is depicted to fully enclose the scene without any clipping problems involving the contained objects. The proportions of the case match those required to encapsulate the arrangement within, and the glass exhibits realistic transparency and reflections consistent with what would be expected in such an environment. This analysis is based on the understanding of typical display case construction and its interaction with enclosed elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all fine details (e.g., stitching, hair, texture edges) preserved and free from blurring, ghosting, or pixelation after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a preservation of fine details such as the stitching on suitcases, the texture edges, and other intricate features without any visible blurring, ghosting, or pixelation that would indicate degradation during an editing process. This observation suggests that the editing has been handled with high consideration for quality retention, which is often prioritized in high-resolution imagery and professional edits.",
