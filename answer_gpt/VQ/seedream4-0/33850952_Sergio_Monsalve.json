    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tentacle-like extensions appear to emerge naturally from the curves of the building's facade. The extensions follow the architecture's flow, maintaining continuity without visible breaks or abrupt shifts. The design intention seems to be a seamless transition from the facade to the extensions, suggesting careful integration and harmony with the original curves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fibrous textures in Image B adhere to the building's curvature, aligning well and maintaining continuity. There seems to be a natural and smooth transition along the curved surfaces, with no evident repeating patterns or jagged edges disrupting the flow, which supports the idea of cohesiveness in design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows in Image B are modified with translucent materials, providing diffused light transmission. The transition between the translucent membranes and the remaining window structures is smooth, lacking sharp borders or noticeable seams. This alteration maintains a gentle, soft appearance, allowing natural light to pass while preserving an aesthetic cohesion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the iridescent scale patterns appear to be well-aligned with the building's curved surfaces. These scales exhibit smooth transitions of color, displaying a visually appealing gradient without any flat or distorted areas that would indicate a mismatch with the surface's curvature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows bio-luminescent lines that emit a soft glow, ebbing gently towards the edges. The light from these features interacts subtly with the surrounding materials, casting a natural luminescence that enhances the surface's dynamic appearance without abrupt changes or harsh edges.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The modifications in Image B, including tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines, appear firmly attached to the building structure. Visual examination suggests no elements are floating or overlapping in a manner inconsistent with the structure, indicating careful placement and cohesion with the architectural design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters remain discernible despite the added textures and lighting effects. These architectural features appear unaffected and undistorted, maintaining their original visibility and integrity under the modifications applied to the facade.",
