      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the black ink outlines around the car's body, wheels, and wing consistently sharp and aligned with the underlying shapes without breaking or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black ink outlines characteristic of comic illustrations are applied around the car's body, wheels, and wing. The sharpness and alignment are necessary to maintain the integrity and readability of the comic style. Observing the image, these outlines are indeed consistently sharp and follow the contours of the car appropriately, without noticeable breaks or overlaps. This includes the sleek lines along the edges of the car's body and its elements, which are necessary for a clear and cohesive comic illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the halftone dots on the car’s side panels and wing appear evenly spaced and consistent in density without visible banding or irregular clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone dots are a staple in comic art, used to create shading and gradients. In Image B, these dots should be evenly spaced and uniform in density to maintain the visual texture indicative of comic styling. Upon examining the car's side panels and wing, the halftone pattern appears regularly distributed and consistent, ensuring there are no gaps or overly dense clusters that would disrupt the intended style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors on the car (such as the wing and side panels) now rendered in muted orange, cream, and deep gray without any residual bright or unnatural hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a color palette common in vintage comic art, characterized by muted tones. The car's wing and side panels exhibit colors in muted orange, cream, and deep gray, aligning with this style. These colors lack the saturation and brightness found in more modern illustrations, ensuring that no residual bright or unnatural hues exist, which might detract from the desired aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines behind the car straight, evenly spaced, and aligned with the direction of travel without curving or intersecting improperly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Motion lines convey speed and direction in comic illustrations. In Image B, these lines are visible behind the sprint car, and they should follow the direction of the car's motion. The lines are straight and uniformly spaced, accurately aligned with the forward trajectory of the car, enhancing the sense of motion without any improper curving or intersecting that might confuse the visual representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble containing “VROOM!” located above the car, fully visible, and free from overlap with the car’s wing or other structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Speech bubbles are essential in comic art for conveying sound and dialogue. The bubble containing “VROOM!” in Image B is placed above the car, adequately separated from the car’s structural elements. This ensures that it remains fully visible, with no interference from the car's wing or other features that could obscure the text. The placement allows for clear readability and understanding by the viewer.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the background behind the car been simplified into flat or textured blocks without retaining detailed figures or structures that conflict with the comic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In transforming Image A's detailed background to a comic style, Image B uses simplification with flat or textured blocks, reducing complexity. The result is a background with less detail, consistent with comic art, where focus is on the primary subjects. This prevents conflict with the comic aesthetic by keeping the surroundings minimal, without retaining intricate figures or structures.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the car’s wheels properly aligned with the axles, and do the suspension arms maintain correct angles and connections without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For accurate depiction in comic-style artwork, the structure and alignment of the car's components need to be maintained. In Image B, the car’s wheels are aligned with the axles correctly, and the suspension arms appear to maintain their intended angles and connections. There are no visible distortions like bending or stretching, which upholds the mechanical accuracy of the vehicle despite the stylistic changes.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic-style treatment preserves essential details needed for brand recognition, including sponsor logos. These logos remain intact and legible, even though they have been adapted to the comic’s simplified aesthetic. Their clarity is crucial for maintaining the car's authenticity and ensuring the logos serve their intended promotional purpose.",
