    "Question": "Q1: Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armor and mechanical elements are designed with intricate details that showcase realistic metallic textures typical of brass, and leather has a convincing texture. The shapes of gears follow typical mechanical design, and their alignment appears precise without visible gaps or misalignments. This attention to detail is crucial for creating a believable steampunk aesthetic, which relies heavily on mechanical and brass elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "The wings in Image B are positioned symmetrically, which is visually apparent as they extend equally on both sides of the character. The mechanical joints and gear patterns seem to be logically arranged, reflecting engineering principles where similar gears are often repeated and connected in a mechanical structure. There are no signs of warped or broken geometry, which suggests a well-crafted design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock face integrated into the armor is clearly visible and seems to appropriately scale with the surrounding details, contributing to the consistent glow effect. It maintains the orb's circular shape without distortion, and the light emission aligns with the surrounding elements, ensuring cohesion in design without compromising the realistic appearance of the orb and tendrils.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
    "explanation": "The cityscape in Image B is depicted with detailed towers and airships that follow a structured layout typical of a well-designed city environment. The lighting and shadowing are consistent with the sepia tone, creating realistic depth and dimension. This provides a cohesive scene, where the sepia tone enhances the fantastical steampunk world while maintaining spatial plausibility without elements appearing floating or disconnected.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
    "explanation": "The sepia tone in Image B is applied uniformly across the image. This consistent application maintains detail visibility in the clothing and mechanical elements of the character, as well as the background cityscape. This ensures that no critical areas suffer from fading or loss of contrast, thereby preserving the clarity and richness required for the steampunk aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
