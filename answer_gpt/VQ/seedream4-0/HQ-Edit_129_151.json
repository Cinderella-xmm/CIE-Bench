      "question": "Does the elderâ€™s face show natural skin texture, realistic wrinkles, and facial proportions without distortion or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elder's face is blurred, preventing any assessment of its naturalness, texture, wrinkles, or proportions. Hence, the image does not provide enough detail to judge these characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and branches in the background structurally coherent, with natural bark texture and no broken or warped shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks and branches are depicted in a stylized manner that resembles a traditional Japanese woodblock print art style. In such styles, textures might be simplified, and natural bark texture might not be as detailed as in a photographic representation. However, within the context of woodblock print, these trees are coherent and fit the style without appearing broken or warped.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface reflect the surrounding trees and sky accurately, with smooth gradients and no distorted or duplicated elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface is likewise depicted in a traditional artistic style, which may not aim for realistic reflections as seen in photographs. Instead, it has a patterned and stylized representation with flat colors, which is typical for such artworks. Therefore, accurate reflection as in reality doesn't apply, but there are no unnatural distortions or duplications within the artistic confines.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the duck-shaped chess pieces positioned correctly on the chessboard squares without overlapping, floating, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the duck-shaped chess pieces appear to be placed accurately on the chessboard squares. The stylized art form does not show any ducks overlapping squares or floating without base support, maintaining logical placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the calligraphy text placed in the lower right corner without overlapping key elements, and does it have clean lines and natural ink-like texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calligraphy text is strategically placed in the lower right; it does not overlap with key elements of the image like the chessboard or ducks. The lines appear neat and consistent with brush or ink strokes typical in woodblock prints, providing an aesthetically appropriate texture.",
