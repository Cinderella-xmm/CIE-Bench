      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or missing details where the vase is replaced with floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase has been replaced with a composition of tightly packed flowers. The flowers are detailed, with each petal and leaf clearly visible, providing a rich texture similar to natural floral arrangements. The transformation maintains the clarity and detail typical of a high-quality image, suggesting there are no missing details or unnatural textures in the floral area.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral elements replacing the vase maintain proper proportions and avoid distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a vase shape formed by flowers that are uniformly packed, preserving the original proportions of the vase. The floral composition maintains symmetry and balances well with the surrounding floral arrangement in the other vase, indicating there are no distorted geometric shapes present.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the floral transformation retain structural consistency and blend naturally with the original vase shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The structure created by flowers in Image B aligns seamlessly with the vase shape present in Image A. The floral arrangement follows the contours and dimensions of the vase while maintaining a uniform appearance, providing a sense of structural consistency that blends well with the expected vase shape.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the vase and floral elements seamless without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the vase area to the floral elements is executed smoothly. The floral elements naturally contour to the implied vase shape without any abrupt changes or visible artifacts, ensuring a seamless transformation from one material to another.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of flowers in the vase-like structure appear natural and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral arrangement in Image B mimics the shape and elegance of the original vase, with flowers densely packed and well-organized. The arrangement appears consistent with how flowers might be artistically placed to resemble the structure of a vase, contributing to a visually credible and natural appearance.",
