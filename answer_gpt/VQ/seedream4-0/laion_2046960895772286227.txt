    "Question": "Q1: Do the arms and legs of the figure have clearly defined joints and correct proportions, with no missing or extra limbs, and do the hands each have exactly five fingers arranged naturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure displays articulated joints typical of a doll. The arms and legs are clearly defined with joint lines visible at the elbows and knees, indicative of their movable nature. The proportions appear consistent with a standard doll, and there are no extra limbs or missing parts. However, upon closer examination of the hands, they are simplified and do not display individual fingers as seen in human anatomy. This is often a feature of dolls, where detail is minimal for fingers.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the pattern on the jacket and the stitching on the skirt preserved and aligned correctly, with no distorted or repeated textures, and does the fabric drape naturally over the doll's form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the jacket appears to have a consistent pattern throughout the fabric, and there is no evidence of distorted or repeated textures. The stitching on the skirt is clearly visible and neatly aligned. The fabrics appear to be well-fitted to the form of the doll, considering the typical non-fluid, stiff draping seen in dolls due to their rigid structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the velvet hat properly sized relative to the head, with visible fabric texture and soft shadows that suggest it is resting on the head rather than floating above it?",
    "explanation": "The hat on the figure in Image B is appropriately sized for the head, fitting snugly as expected for a doll. The velvet texture is visible, indicating its material. The shadows cast by the hat are soft, implying it rests naturally on the head rather than floating, which suggests correct rendering and positioning.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages in the background proportionally smaller than the doll and rendered with consistent textures and lighting that match the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements like the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages appear proportionally smaller than the doll, which maintains the perspective that the doll is the focus. The textures and lighting are consistent with the overall scene, suggesting a coherent and realistic environment within the scale of a doll setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "explanation": "The figure in Image B shows the characteristics typical of dolls, with simplified features on the face. The limbs display clear joint lines, especially at the elbows, indicating hinges and mobility typical of dolls. There are no signs of unnatural bending or stretching, which confirms the figure's status as a doll.",
