      "question": "Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows wooden planks on the house fully integrated into the structure. The visual cues indicate that the wood panels are aligned without visible gaps or misalignment, as the texture appears consistent without any noticeable unnatural repetition. This conclusion is derived from the consistent pattern and fitting of the wood material, which suggests professional craftsmanship and design. Comparison with Image A reveals similar integration, indicating it remains unchanged.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss texture on Image B is applied to common areas where moss would realistically grow, like near the ground level and corners of stone blocks. It appears layered and organic, blending well with the setting, and avoids any floating or uncharacteristically flat patches. This appropriateness can be deduced by understanding typical moss coverage areas in similar animated environments. Compared to Image A, where no moss is present, the addition in Image B is well-integrated and visually realistic.",

      "question": "Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a uniform adjustment to earthy tones across the roof tiles, walls, and wooden features. These elements exhibit consistent coloration, avoiding abrupt color changes or discoloration lines. This uniformity suggests a harmonized palette likely intended for realistic aesthetic purposes, typical in similar designs. In contrast, Image A also uses earthy tones but lacks any additional adjustment, signifying that Image B maintained the initial approach.",

      "question": "Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature characters in Image B are scaled to match human proportions relative to the house, positioned sensibly around the building as if traversing a game board or scenario map, like near doors or paths. They stand on the board with no indication of floating or intersecting with the house infrastructure. This plausible setup corresponds to typical fantasy or role-playing games where characters navigate around structures. Image A does not feature any characters, making this addition a new feature in Image B.",

      "question": "Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment board in Image B appears to be laid flat with realistic folds and texture indicative of a paper or fabric material. Shadows cast by the board align with the overall light source direction indicated by the illumination on the structure, demonstrating thoughtful integration into the scene. Understanding typical board presentations in real-world gaming or display setups aids in recognizing these visual efforts. Image A lacks this prop, signifying its intentional incorporation in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rule booklets in Image B are illustrated with consistent page thickness and defined spine details, presenting as authentic objects. Their shadows align well with the scene's lighting, suggesting adherence to realistic light interplay. Knowledge of typical booklet appearances aids in evaluating these details. Image A does not include rule booklets, characterizing their addition in Image B as a deliberate design choice.",
