      "question": "Does the gold foil detailing on the kimono’s floral patterns appear uniformly reflective and seamlessly integrated with the red fabric, without visible textural mismatches or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold foil detailing on the kimono appears to be uniform and evenly distributed, reflecting light in a way that suggests consistency with the red fabric. The integration of gold with the fabric shows seamlessness, without abrupt transitions or textural mismatches. This can be identified by the smooth continuity across the surface, visually consistent with real-world applications of gold foil on textiles.",

      "question": "Are the iridescent highlights in the woman’s hair distributed along natural light paths and do they display smooth color gradients without fragmented or unrealistic chromatic aberrations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases iridescent highlights in the woman's hair, displaying a smooth transition of colors along what could be considered natural light paths. The gradients are coherent and display a realistic chromatic progression, avoiding fragmented or abrupt changes, indicative of how light naturally interacts with surfaces.",

      "question": "Do the stylized bamboo elements in the background maintain their vertical alignment and structural integrity, with soft watercolor textures applied evenly without breaking geometric forms or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features bamboo elements that maintain their vertical alignment and appear structurally intact. The watercolor textures are applied in a manner that is consistent and do not disrupt the geometric forms or create floating segments, indicative of stylized accuracy. They are blended seamlessly, reflecting natural structural integrity seen in bamboo.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-shaped writing spaces and embossed borders placed in non-intrusive areas of the image and do they show consistent depth cues such as subtle shadows and raised textures without appearing flat or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral-shaped writing spaces have been placed in a non-intrusive manner, avoiding key areas of focus of the image. The embossed borders show depth cues through subtle shadows and raised textures, suggesting dimensionality rather than flatness. They are aligned well within the composition, enhancing rather than disrupting the visual balance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the woman’s body proportionally consistent with natural human anatomy, with no elongated limbs, distorted facial features, or unnatural curvature in posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's body in Image B appears to be proportionally consistent with that of natural human anatomy. There are no elongated limbs or unnatural curvature in the posture, and the features remain within the boundaries of natural depiction. This consistency can be assessed based on standard anatomical proportions visible in the image.",
