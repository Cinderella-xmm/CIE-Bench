      "question": "Do the iridescent scales cover the cardinal’s body smoothly without visible seams, pixelation, or inconsistent color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal's body is covered with iridescent scales, which require smooth transitions and uniformity in color to maintain a realistic and seamless appearance. Upon inspecting the image, the scales appear to lay smoothly across the body, exhibiting a consistent gradient without pixelation or visible seams. The shimmering effect is well-executed, maintaining the illusion of a natural covering. Therefore, the scales are convincingly applied.",

      "question": "Are the flames emerging from the wingtips and tail oriented upward and shaped naturally, without abrupt edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flames from the wingtips and tail should exhibit a natural, flowing appearance. When observing the image, the flames are depicted with a fluid motion, primarily oriented upward and integrating seamlessly with the feathers. There are no abrupt edges or disjointed fragments, suggesting a lifelike representation of fire. This natural flow supports the idea that the flames are depicted realistically.",

      "question": "Is the glowing ember effect confined to the eye area, with no halo bleed onto the surrounding feathers or face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the glowing ember effect in Image B, the effect should remain localized to the eye area. On examination, the glow is centered within the eye, without visible bleed or halo extending onto neighboring feathers or the bird's face. The controlled application of glow ensures the distinctness of the eye feature without interference on surrounding areas, confirming that the effect is well-contained.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the obsidian branch retain the original branch’s branching pattern and thickness, with a smooth, glassy surface free of cracks or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing the original branch in Image A with the obsidian branch in Image B, the latter should mimic the former's pattern and dimensions while adopting an obsidian texture. The branch in Image B maintains the branching pattern and thickness of Image A, with a surface that appears smooth and glassy, resembling polished obsidian. The consistency in pattern, thickness, and texture confirms the accurate adaptation.",

      "question": "Are the flames on the blossoms directly connected to the petals, with no detached or floating flame elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flames must appear integrated with the blossoms, emerging directly from the petals. Inspection shows the flames connecting seamlessly at the tips of the petals, without any detached or floating elements. This integration simulates a naturally occurring combustion on the blossom tips, establishing a realistic flame application on the flowers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the snowflakes falling around the flaming elements evenly distributed, with no unnatural absence or clustering near the fire?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes in Image B should show an even distribution around the various elements, including the flaming parts. In analyzing the distribution, the snowflakes appear uniformly dispersed across the image, with no noticeable gaps or clusters specifically near the flaming sections. This suggests that the snowflake pattern respects the typical random nature of snowfall, even in proximity to the fire.",
