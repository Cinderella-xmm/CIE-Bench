      "question": "Have the brushstrokes added to the sofa preserved its structural integrity without causing distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is depicted in a Van Gogh style, characterized by dynamic, swirling brushstrokes. However, despite the artistic texture applied, the overall structure of the sofa, including its form and dimensions, remain intact. The brushstrokes add an artistic flair but do not distort the essential shape or make it appear structurally unsound. The use of color and technique reflect the Van Gogh style while respecting the sofa's structural integrity. In comparison to Image A, the sofa has been given a dynamic texture, but its shape and recognizability remain consistent.",

      "question": "Does the wall, including the framed painting, appear naturally integrated with the rest of the room after the style conversion, without any broken geometric shapes or lost fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall is transformed using Van Gogh's style, featuring swirling patterns and vibrant colors. The framed painting appears as an integral part of the wall, consistent with the overall style transformation, but it retains its fundamental composition, including the landscape within the frame. The geometric shapes of the frame and wall are preserved, maintaining their original clarity. Comparing to Image A, although the wall has a distinctively artistic pattern, the overall integration is seamless without disrupting geometric shapes or losing fine details of the painting.",

      "question": "Are the plant's leaves depicted with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes while still retaining a recognizable and plausible appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plant's leaves are rendered with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes, characterized by swirling and thick applications of paint. Despite the stylized transformation, the leaves retain their shape and are easily recognizable as plant foliage. There are no unnatural artifacts or distortions that make the leaves appear unrealistic. When comparing with Image A, the leaves have a similar silhouette and structure, though they are more dynamic in their textural appearance, aligning with Van Gogh’s art style without compromising recognizability.",

      "question": "Has the side table and lamp been converted to fit the Van Gogh style while preserving their realistic proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side table and lamp have been stylistically altered to reflect the Van Gogh painting style. The brushstrokes add a textured, vibrant character to these objects, but their proportions and overall designs remain coherent and logical. Despite the transformation, the lamp’s shape and the table's structure are preserved, showcasing realistic proportions without distortion. Comparing to Image A, the side table and lamp maintain the same forms and dimensions, indicating that the conversion to Van Gogh style didn't compromise their physical realism or details.",

      "question": "Do all elements in the room maintain a harmonious and plausible arrangement in Van Gogh style, ensuring no disruption in the spatial relationships among objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements are cohesively presented in a Van Gogh style, harmonizing with the room's layout. The arrangement of the sofa, side table, lamp, plant, and framed painting is intact, maintaining their spatial relationships and relative positions. The use of Van Gogh's textural effect does not disrupt the room's composition or introduce spatial inconsistencies. Compared to Image A, although the texture and style have changed significantly to reflect a painterly finish, the overall layout remains logical and visually pleasing, with all elements residing in intended places.",
