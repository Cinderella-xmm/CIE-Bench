      "question": "Does the creature's body maintain the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the bubble tea cup's shape and texture without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature seamlessly integrates the shape and texture of the bubble tea cup into its body. The lid, straw, and tapioca pearls are all consistent with their expected appearances on a bubble tea cup, and the body elements blend smoothly without distortions. The creature's head retains the overall shape and texture of a bubble tea cup, providing both a coherent and visually plausible design. The body is stylized to resemble a figure with a bubble tea cup as the head, which is artistically executed to keep the original concept intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the design elements like tapioca pearls and the straw integrated naturally into the creature's form without appearing as unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tapioca pearls are integrated into the design as part of the creature’s body pattern and facial features, maintaining the visual theme of bubble tea. The straw serves as a natural continuation of the cup's lid at the top, mimicking the typical appearance of a bubble tea cup. These elements are consistent with their natural appearance in a bubble tea cup and do not introduce any unnatural textures or artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the custom orb or capsule near the creature's feet feature patterns and colors consistent with the bubble tea theme without losing fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The custom orb or capsule near the creature's feet in Image B features a pattern and color scheme consistent with the bubble tea theme. The orb is colored similarly to the tapioca pearls within the creature’s cup head and retains a glossy texture indicative of the liquid/pearl theme. The details of the orb, such as the spots symbolizing tapioca pearls, are finely illustrated without any unnatural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the creature relative to the custom orb/capsule and the overall scene logically consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the creature in Image B are logically consistent with the orb/capsule next to it. The creature, designed with a playful and cartoonish style, matches the scale typically associated with cute fictional characters. The orb, serving as an accessory to the creature, is aptly sized to complement the creature without seeming out of place or causing any distortions in the overall scene.",

      "question": "Does the presentation of the creature's name and elemental type complement the artwork's charm without disrupting the visual flow or introducing distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is unobtrusively placed next to the creature, providing information on its name and element type without overwhelming the artwork. The styling and size of the text match the playful art style and do not detract from the main visual focus, enhancing the overall presentation rather than disrupting it. The choice of font and its placement are consistent with maintaining the charm of the design.",
