    "Question": "Q1: Are the bark textures on the logs continuous and aligned with the original log shapes, showing no abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the logs have been transformed with bark textures, which seem to blend naturally with the background and maintain the cylindrical shape of the original logs. These textures appear consistent across the logs without noticeable mismatched edges or scaling issues, suggesting a smooth application over the original log shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the glowing amber eyes fit precisely within the original window openings without distorting the surrounding log structure or spreading light beyond the intended area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing amber eyes are placed within window openings formed seemingly by the logs. The light from the eyes does not cause distortion to the surrounding log structure and stays confined within the openings, without casting excessive glow beyond the designated area.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the leafy canopy extend upward from the roof ridge in a natural, gravity-consistent manner, with leaves overlapping logically and not appearing suspended or detached?",
    "explanation": "The leafy canopy in Image B extends naturally from the roof ridge, with the branches and leaves appearing subject to gravity. The foliage overlaps in several layers, giving an impression of weight and natural growth rather than floating clumps, which indicates a logical and realistic arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the vines and moss growing along the logs and roofline in a way that follows natural climbing patterns, with no flat, disconnected patches or unnatural straight lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, vines and moss are seen growing over the logs and roofline, appearing to follow natural climbing, spreading patterns without any disrupted connections or straight lines that would be atypical for such natural growth. The vegetation integrates seamlessly without flat or detached patches, indicating a cohesive application.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the runes carved into the logs with consistent depth and alignment, following the roundness of the logs and not appearing as flat or misaligned symbols?",
    "explanation": "The runes on the logs in Image B are carved in a manner that follows the curvature of the logs, maintaining consistent depth and alignment in relation to the log's surface. The symbols are not flatly imposed or visibly misaligned, suggesting a well-integrated, three-dimensional effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the forest spirit faces positioned within the original garage door frames, with facial features properly scaled and energy trails flowing outward in a smooth, non-jagged manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the forest spirit faces are placed within the original outline of the garage door frames. Their features are scaled to fit the space, and the energy trails emanating from them flow outward smoothly, without sharp or jagged interruptions, maintaining the continuity of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
```

```json
{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all structural components (logs, roof, canopy, vines, faces) connected seamlessly without gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "All structural elements in Image B, including the logs, roof, leafy canopy, vines, and forest spirit faces, are tightly integrated into the overall scene. There are no visible gaps, floating parts, or geometric distortions disrupting the continuity or realism of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
