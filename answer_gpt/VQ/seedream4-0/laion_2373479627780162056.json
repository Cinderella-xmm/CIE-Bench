      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden pinstripes aligned with the suit’s fabric grain and do they reflect light consistently with the surrounding material, avoiding floating or misaligned lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden pinstripes in Image B are rendered in a manner consistent with the suit's fabric grain. They are incorporated seamlessly into the watercolor painting, reflecting light in tandem with the surrounding material and showing no signs of being misaligned or detached from the suit’s form.",

      "question": "Is the pattern on the tie uniformly distributed, maintaining consistent size and spacing across its surface without stretching or repeating errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie's pattern seems to be evenly distributed, with consistent size and spacing, typical of a detailed watercolor representation. There are no noticeable errors such as stretching, distortion, or repeating anomalies seen that would disrupt the uniform appearance of the tie.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather-bound border in Image B displays elements such as stitching, grain, and lettering. These features appear realistic, maintaining their structural integrity without visual warping or clipping into the subject’s overall image, suggesting a lifelike representation consistent with physical objects.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is characterized by a soft, uniform texture that resembles satin paper, with subtle reflections that provide an authentic look without producing harsh glare or pixelation. The transitions in tone and reflection are handled smoothly, contributing to a cohesive appearance.",
