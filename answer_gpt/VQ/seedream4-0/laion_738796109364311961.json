      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player in red has exaggerated muscle proportions, typical in stylized art presentations intended to emphasize strength or action. The muscle depiction remains plausible, showing good anatomical understanding, with proportional biceps, thighs, and calves that suggest enhanced power without crossing into unnatural, distorted bulges. This artistic exaggeration is common in illustrations that aim to capture dynamic athleticism.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows players with vibrant uniforms that keep natural color gradients and material textures intact. The reflection of light and shadow provides depth to their clothing, preventing the appearance of oversaturation or flatness. The vibrant colors enhance the visual appeal, while the texture details, such as fabric creases, remain, ensuring a realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the team logos are meticulously rendered on the helmets and jerseys of both players. The logos appear sharp, accurately aligned with the curved surfaces of the helmets and the contours of the jerseys without any visible distortion or pixelation. This indicates careful attention to detail to maintain branding consistency in the stylized rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that is stylistically enhanced, lending a dynamic atmosphere to the scene. The crowd and field markings are articulated without distortion, maintaining coherence with the active foreground. The background is vivid and illustrative, yet consistent in detail proportionate to the overall image presentation, which supports the energy of the sporting event depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Even with the exaggerated stylistic element in Image B, both players' limbs and postures maintain a structural consistency in alignment with real-world biomechanics. The limbs are fluid in their motion, and the postures align with typical athletic movements one would expect in football, ensuring credible action representation without any disjointed or unnaturally floating parts.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the matte black collector's box with a transparent lid is presented with clear consistency in material texture, lighting, and perspective. It surrounds the scene effectively, showing no edge artifacts or lighting mismatches, indicating adept integration into the space it occupies, lending a cohesive view. This careful design consideration is crucial for visual harmony in stylized compositions.",
