    "Question": "Q1: Do the extended page edges blend naturally into the frame without introducing any unnatural breaks or abrupt transitions at the corners?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the extended page edges smoothly integrate with the rest of the image frame. The photo shows an open book on a wooden table, with no visible breaks or sharp transitions at the page corners. The pages appear naturally folded, maintaining the overall aesthetic without any abrupt visual changes, thus creating a seamless appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the curved shadow cast by the extended pages follow the lighting direction present in the original image, contributing to a natural perception of depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the curved shadow cast by the pages aligns with the lighting direction inferred from the overall ambiance of the image. The photo exhibits soft shadows consistent with prevailing light sources, reinforcing the perception of depth. Shadows are naturally projected following the page curve and do not appear inconsistent with the lighting conditions depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the texture and fine details of the extended pages consistent with the original pages, with no visible loss or distortion of the text and paper grain?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases pages with clearly visible text and paper grain consistent with original page characteristics observed in similar scenarios, like traditional printed books. Text remains readable, and paper textures maintain a uniformity that typifies real book pages without distortion or loss of detail, contributing to a coherent visual experience.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the curvature of the extended pages consistent with the perspective of the original image, creating a believable unfolding effect without distorting the geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The curvature of the pages in Image B maintains consistency with the perspective of the book's layout. The pages exhibit a natural unfolding appearance, adhering to the book's geometric configuration without suggesting distortion or over-exaggeration. This effect supports a realistic spatial representation coherent with the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the interaction between the base of the book and the wooden table appear natural, with no unrealistic gaps or overlaps introduced by the extension of the pages?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book's base is depicted resting atop a wooden table with no discernible gaps or overlaps that might suggest editing anomalies. The extended pages blend into the scene without revealing inconsistencies in how the book settles on the surface, maintaining realism in how objects interact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
