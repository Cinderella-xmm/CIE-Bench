      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the 3D chibi character's suit appears well-structured, with clear delineation of the lapels, buttons, and overall shape that match those of typical formal suits. The cup is also rendered accurately, maintaining the realistic shape seen in the original image with no noticeable distortions. This matches the common aesthetic of 3D chibi models, which often aim for an exaggerated, yet structurally sound representation of elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the background retain the natural appearance of the suit and the warm glow of the lamp without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi character in the background maintains the key elements of the suit, ensuring a consistent representation with crisp lines and proper proportions. The lamp in the background emits a soft warm glow, similar to the original, without showing any unnatural artifacts or unrealistic lighting effects. This consistency with real-world physics enhances the integrity of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and suit details of both chibi characters rendered with sufficient detail and texture to avoid looking unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi characters typically have exaggerated features with simplified details, yet the suit details such as the buttons and lapels are rendered with clarity and coherence, aligning with the expected chibi aesthetic. Despite the simplification, the 3D model avoids looking unnatural due to the careful preservation of key textural details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands of the chibi characters, especially the one holding the cup, appear proportionate and physically plausible without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand of the main chibi character holding the cup is rendered to match the characteristic style of chibi figures, with exaggerated proportions yet maintaining a physically plausible connection to the cup. This style avoids distortions by staying consistent with typical proportions seen in similar 3D chibi models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene enhance the visual credibility and realism of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The presence of a photo frame around the chibi-style scene adds a contextual layer, suggesting the setup is part of a decorative piece or artwork display. This complements the 3D style, enhancing the composition by framing it as an art piece rather than a photorealistic scene, which aligns well with the inherent aesthetic of chibi models.",
