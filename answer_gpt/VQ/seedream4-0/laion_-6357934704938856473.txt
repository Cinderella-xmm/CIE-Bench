    "Question": "Q1: Are the brushed metal and matte finishes applied consistently across the robot’s body without visible texture artifacts or inconsistent sheen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's body surfaces appear to have a consistent combination of brushed metal and matte finishes. This finish is even and maintained throughout the various components, suggesting a high level of attention to detail. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistency in the sheen, which implies a high-quality rendering in the CGI design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the hexagonal box fully enclosed around the robot with clean edges, proper proportions, and a clearly legible \"MECHA VANGUARD\" label without distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a hexagonal box that appears fully enclosed with clean edges and proper proportions. The label 'MECHA VANGUARD' is clearly legible and without distortion, indicating careful graphic design and adherence to proportional balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces clear and non-blurry, and do the joint areas (elbows, knees) show no signs of geometric distortion or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "The engraving on the armor plates and weapon surfaces in Image B appears detailed and clear, showing no signs of blur. Additionally, the joints at the elbows and knees are designed without distortion or visible issues, reflecting a high level of detail and precision in the CGI rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the cityscape background extend behind the robot without clipping through its limbs or body, and does it match the lighting direction and scale of the scene?",
    "explanation": "The cityscape background in Image B extends behind the robot and does not intrude or clip through the limbs or body, indicating proper spatial arrangement. The lighting and scale seem to match the overall scene including the robot, adding to the image's realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces correctly aligned and positioned without overlapping or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's limbs, weapons, and armor pieces appear to be well-aligned and properly positioned, with no signs of overlapping or floating elements that would disrupt spatial logic. These observations suggest a coherent and well-executed 3D model positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
