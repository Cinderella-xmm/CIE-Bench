      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain character is depicted with simplified features typical of chibi designs. It has stylized hair represented by smooth and rounded lines rather than textured details, and circular glasses that are cartoonish in nature. The original image (Image A) showcases the character with realistic hair texture and no visible glasses. Based on chibi design conventions, the simplification is intentional to maintain consistency with typical chibi aesthetics, not to perfectly match detailed characteristics of the original. Thus, the chibi version intentionally diverges, focusing on a cute and simplified representation while keeping recognizability.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf and wand are depicted in smooth, consistent colors and shapes without intricate textures, matching the overall simplistic aesthetic of the chibi figure. Chibi designs prioritize simplicity and use basic shapes and solid colors instead of detailed textures. These elements are coherent with the rest of the chibi design, lacking detailed texture intentionally to complement the stylized form of the chibi character.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure has a hand holding a wand that fits the exaggerated and endearing proportions typical of chibi designs, which often feature oversized heads and smaller bodies. The hand is simplified, round, and cartoon-like, proportionate with routine chibi aesthetics. While chibi proportions may not follow realistic anatomy strictly, they maintain a visual coherence that fits within the chibi design aesthetic without appearing unnatural.",

      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is seamlessly integrated into the wooden background. The lighting and shadowing are consistent across the character and the background, with no visible artifacts or disruptions. Such blending is typical in product photography, particularly for keychains, where clean integration enhances presentation and visual appeal. The lack of artifacts promotes a coherent and pleasing aesthetic of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the scarf and tie are depicted with solid, clean lines characteristic of chibi design principles. They are simple and cartoon-like, avoiding unnecessary complexity or distortion. This design choice maintains the smooth, coherent shapes typical of chibi figures, where stylistic consistency is vital to preserve visual appeal.",
