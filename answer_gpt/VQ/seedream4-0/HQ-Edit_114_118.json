    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome have a smooth, seamless surface without visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions that disrupt the visual continuity of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears smooth and curved, with a consistent look around the ship and other elements. There are no visible seams or scratches that would break the visual continuity. The clarity and finish of the glass dome project a seamless and high-quality surface, allowing for clear visibility of the ship inside. This suggests careful attention to detail in the construction of the image, affirming the smoothness and continuity of the surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit layered, folded paper-like textures with consistent shadows and depth, without geometric distortions or flattened areas that deviate from their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails exhibit a well-rendered folded paper-like texture. The light and shadows play across them consistently, indicating depth and multiple layers typical of sails. There are no geometric distortions or flattened areas visible, as the sails maintain their expected curvature and shape, suggesting they are accurately depicted with attention to texture and shadow dynamics.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer below the ship show consistent translucency, internal glow, and wave-like patterns without abrupt transitions or unnatural textures at the hull interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue resin beneath the ship reveals translucent properties, allowing light to pass through and create a glowing effect. The resin is fashioned into wave-like patterns, mimicking the motion of water. It transitions smoothly at the hull interface, without abrupt changes in texture or color. The combination of translucency and consistent texture enhances the design's realistic appearance and coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls connected by faint, straight wires that do not interfere with their natural flight positions or create visible mechanical supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seagulls within the glass dome appear to maintain natural flight positions. There are faint wires visible, which do not obstruct their positions or create noticeable mechanical support structures. The subtle use of wires suggests they are carefully integrated to preserve the illusion of flight without disrupting visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) correctly positioned and scaled within the glass dome without clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that compromises structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements of the composition—the ship, sails, water, birds, and background sky—are positioned in a balanced manner within the glass dome. They are scaled to fit harmoniously, allowing adequate space for each component without clipping or overlapping. The structural coherence appears intact, reflecting careful attention to arrangement and perspective.",
