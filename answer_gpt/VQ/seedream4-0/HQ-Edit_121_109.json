      "question": "Do the hummingbird's wings display a seamless, continuous iridescent glass-like texture with natural light reflection and rainbow color gradients, free from jagged edges or artificial-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited hummingbird's wings in Image B appear to have a smooth, iridescent glass texture that reflects light naturally. The wings display rainbow color gradients that transition smoothly without jagged edges or artificial patterns, akin to a polished crystal surface. These visual cues suggest careful attention to detail, allowing the wings to convey the desired aesthetic of graceful translucency and colorful luminescence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent petals covering the hummingbird’s body arranged in a way that follows the bird’s body contours without gaps, overlaps, or unnatural spacing, and do they exhibit consistent lighting and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals adorning the hummingbird's body are meticulously aligned to follow the anatomical contours of the bird. They maintain a coherent spacing without any apparent gaps or overlaps that might detract from the seamless appearance. Additionally, the lighting across these petals is uniform, enhancing their translucent quality and further integrating them into the bird's aesthetic design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the crystalline spout seamlessly integrated into the hummingbird’s head, with realistic internal refraction and a coherent, gravity-consistent flow of nectar emerging from its tip?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystalline spout emanating from the hummingbird's beak in Image B exhibits a seamless connection, appearing as an extension of the bird's anatomy rather than a separate element. The internal refraction of light within the crystalline structure enhances the realism, and the flow of nectar follows a natural trajectory influenced by gravity, further lending to the internal coherence and realism of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trailing vines and blossoms extending from the hummingbird’s tail maintain natural growth patterns, with gradual tapering and evenly spaced flowers, and do they avoid appearing stiff or unnaturally rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines and blossoms extending from the tail in Image B demonstrate a naturalistic growth pattern with a gradual tapering toward the ends, reminiscent of a living plant. The spacing of the flowers is even, and the vines exhibit a fluid, natural curve rather than a rigid structure, supporting the organic theme and enhancing the realism of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed hummingbird cast a shadow consistent with the ambient lighting direction and intensity, and does its overall appearance harmonize with the surrounding garden elements in terms of color temperature and luminosity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited hummingbird in Image B aligns with the ambient lighting, casting a shadow that matches the direction of light evident in the garden setting. The color temperature and luminosity of the hummingbird are consistent with the surrounding elements, allowing it to integrate seamlessly with the vibrant and colorful garden environment depicted, maintaining a harmonious visual balance.",
