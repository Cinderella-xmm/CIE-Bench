    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the leather texture across the backpack's main body appear uniformly consistent in grain, color, and thickness without unnatural seams or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image portrays a backpack with a leather texture. Evaluating the appearance of the leather involves assessing whether the grain, color, and thickness appear even and harmonious. Typically, high-quality leather textures show regularity in these aspects without visible anomalies like poorly matched seams or discolored patches. Observing Image B, the leather texture does look consistent throughout, with no visibly jarring transitions or inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the buckle surfaces altered to display a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing and realistic light reflection, without deformed shapes or mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buckle surfaces are evaluated for their color and reflective properties. Brass typically has a warm, metallic finish with slight tarnishing that gives it character, alongside a realistic reflection of light. Observing the buckles in the edited image, they display a metallic sheen with natural highlights and shadows, suggesting a realistic finish without deformation or disconnect in appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the travel patches positioned on the side pockets with proper alignment to the stitching and fabric contours, showing no warping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Travel patches should give the appearance of being securely affixed to a fabric surface, conforming naturally to the material's contours. This involves checks for warping or floating effects, which would indicate editing errors. Inspection of Image B reveals that the patches appear seamlessly integrated into the side pocket's design, indicating proper adherence and alignment with no distortion visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" text clearly visible on the front flap, properly aligned with the flap’s curvature, and free from jagged edges or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Text applied to a curved surface should conform naturally to the shape and maintain clarity without distortion. The \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" text on Image B is assessed for alignment and clarity—observing that it indeed follows the curvature of the flap well, with sharp and smooth edge definition and no ghosting effect apparent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the compass graphic near the base of the backpack rendered with fine, consistent lines that follow a circular pattern and do not distort the surrounding leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Graphics on textured surfaces must maintain line consistency and integrate well with the material's innate features. The compass graphic in Image B is examined for line precision and integration with the leather texture. It displays an intricate circular design with consistent line work and no distortion in the leather texture visible behind it.",
