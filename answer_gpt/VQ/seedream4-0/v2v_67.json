      "question": "Are the sunglasses on the horse's face free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is a simplified cartoon depiction situated inside a decorative box. It does not have sunglassesâ€”only the backdrop illustrates a sunset scene similar to Image A. Therefore, the absence of sunglasses renders any discussion of texture and artifact irrelevant.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the horse's facial structure maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the addition of sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is simplified into a cartoonish miniature without any sunglasses placed on it, concentrating on the toy-like essence rather than realistic facial structure. Image A projects a real horse wearing sunglasses, crafted to appear plausible with its anatomical features. In Image B's context, a comparison with Image A about sunglasses integration is non-applicable.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the horse's fur texture and details preserved without any loss or unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a simplified, non-realistic horse figurine with generalized features, distinctly lacking fur texture. Image A, contrastingly, includes real fur texture on the horse's face crafted to accompany sunglasses without betraying unnatural artifacts. Therefore, assessing fur texture preservation relating to sunglasses doesn't apply to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sunglasses' material and reflections appear realistic and consistent with the lighting conditions of the sunset scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have sunglasses on the horse, focusing on a toy-like representation where lighting and reflection authenticity concerning sunglasses can't be evaluated as in Image A. Image A's original setup involves balancing sunset lighting with sunglasses' reflections crafted to appear consistent.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the horse's eyes visible and undistorted under the sunglasses, preserving their natural shape and position?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a toy-like horse without sunglasses, thus lacks naturalistic eye depiction influenced by sunglasses. Image A, however, manages sunglasses seamlessly without distortions influencing eye visibility and position. Evaluation of sunglasses impact on eye features becomes irrelevant for Image B.",
