      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a giant golem-like figure whose design incorporates elements resembling architectural constructs, such as archways. By analyzing the visual cues and comparing it to typical structural features of arches in architecture, we can determine that the limbs mimic the natural joint transitions often seen in constructed arches, without exhibiting any breaks or unnatural bends in the geometry. Therefore, the golemâ€™s limbs maintain fluidity and coherence similar to that of an archway.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detailed features of glowing glyphs can be observed on the stone surface of the golem. These glyphs exhibit a consistent pattern across the surface, maintaining equal spacing and closely aligned with the stone texture, ensuring a visually harmonious integration. The edges are smooth without pixelation or abrupt color shifts, suggesting the use of refined editing techniques rather than digital artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mystical aura in Image B is analyzed to understand its interaction with shadowed regions. Visual cues indicate that the aura gradually emerges and disperses around the structure, providing continuity between well-lit and shadowed areas. The aura appears grounded and natural without any abrupt transitions or disconnected light effects, ensuring seamless blending.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By analyzing Image B, the luminous guide wisp is positioned on the path similarly to the original person and dog silhouette in Image A. The wisp maintains the original scale and alignment, ensuring consistent spatial composition. It is designed to have a translucent texture with wispy, ethereal qualities, distinctly lacking solid edges or anatomical features typical of the original figures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem is centrally positioned amongst a series of landscape layers. By analyzing depth cues, including size, overlapping elements, and shadows, the golem integrates seamlessly within the spatial environment. The perceptual layering from foreground to background allows the figure to appear grounded in the scene accurately, rather than detached or floating outside the frame.",
