      "question": "Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wingâ€™s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings have sheet music patterns incorporated into the orange sections. These patterns appear to blend naturally with the wings, maintaining the integrity of the vein lines without causing texture artifacts. This is based on observing how the sheet music overlays with the wing patterns, where the natural structures of the butterfly are not disrupted, suggesting a seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's antennae emerge from the head and extend with a graceful, continuous curve. There are no visible kinks or breaks, and the length appears proportionate to the butterfly's size, consistent with how antennae might realistically look. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of symmetry and smoothness in the curve, which reflects a natural aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features flowers with petals that resemble musical notes, yet they maintain a curvature and thickness similar to natural petals. The petals are visually consistent in aspect and form with how real petals might appear, with the decorative element of resembling music notes subtly integrated without distorting their natural flower-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement in Image B depicts the butterfly along with surrounding flowers in a manner that seems balanced and harmonious. Each element appears positioned at a plausible distance and angle, contributing to a coherent overall composition. This assessment is based on the visual symmetry and relationship between elements, suggesting a deliberate and balanced design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text rendered with smooth, continuous strokes and no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'Monarch's Garden Symphony' is rendered with smooth and continuous strokes. The letterforms exhibit no aliasing or jagged edges, presenting a clean and refined appearance. This is evident from the precise curves and straight lines, which are free from any pixelation or irregularities, indicating a high-quality rendering.",
