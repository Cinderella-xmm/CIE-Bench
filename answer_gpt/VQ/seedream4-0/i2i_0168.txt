    "Question": "Q1: Do the carrots and soil maintain their texture and detail, appearing natural against the Arctic background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots and soil maintain a clear and detailed appearance. The carrots are shown with distinct grooves and vibrant orange color, while the soil looks rich and textured. Despite the unusual setting of the Arctic background, the appearance of the carrots and soil remain consistent with what one would expect from a typical agricultural setting. This indicates that their texture and detail have been preserved even against the contrasting Arctic environment, achieving a natural look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are there any visible artificial or unnatural textures where the Arctic background meets the soil and carrots?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, no noticeable artificial or unnatural textures are apparent where the Arctic background meets the soil and carrots. The transition seems natural, without abrupt changes or digital artifacts that would suggest an artificial composite. The snow appears to integrate smoothly around the soil, maintaining a realistic mix.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the carrots retain their proper size and shape relative to the snowy landscape in the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots appear of a reasonable size and shape relative to their environment. The foregrounded carrots are large compared to the distant background elements, which aligns with typical perspective rules in photography. This suggests the carrots retain the correct relative size and don't seem disproportionately large or small compared to the snowy landscape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the transition between the soil surrounding the carrots and the Arctic background appear seamless and undistorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from soil around the carrots to the Arctic background appears to be seamless. There is no visible distortion at the intersection where the soil meets the snow, which a well-executed photomontage would achieve. The integration of these elements suggests careful editing to maintain realistic continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the fine details of the snow and icebergs in the background crisp and free of degradation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow and icebergs in the background appear crisp and show a good level of detail. The iceberg edges are defined, and the snow has visible texture, indicating no significant loss of detail or degradation in the background."
    "answer": "Yes"
