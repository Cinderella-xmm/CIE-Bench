      "question": "Do the transformed wings retain smooth, continuous petal shapes that follow natural curvature and avoid jagged or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings have been transformed into a visually appealing design resembling stylized flower petals. These wings maintain a smooth and continuous shape, which follows a natural curvature similar to how flower petals would typically appear. They do not have jagged or fragmented edges, suggesting attention to detail in the editing process. This conclusion is drawn from observing the smooth transitions and harmonious flow of the petal shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaf designs on the wings detailed, evenly distributed, and free from unnatural pixelation or repeating patterns that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features wings adorned with leaf designs that exhibit a high level of detail and are evenly distributed across the wings. The visual representation of these leaves appears natural and devoid of signs of pixelation or repeating patterns that would typically indicate digital artifacts. This observation suggests a meticulous editing process resulting in a realistic appearance of the leaf designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tendrils extending from the antennae curve smoothly and taper gradually, resembling natural plant growth rather than sharp, mechanical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tendrils extending from the antennae in Image B are crafted in a way that they curve smoothly and taper off in a gradual manner. This design mimics the natural growth pattern of plant tendrils, which typically exhibit fluid and organic curves, as opposed to sharp or mechanical lines. The careful attention to creating these naturalistic forms is evident from the depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small blossoms at the wing edges and foot similar in color, texture, and size to the surrounding flowers in the meadow, and do they attach seamlessly without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small blossoms located at the wing edges and foot of the butterfly in Image B match the meadow flowers in terms of color, texture, and size. They are integrated seamlessly, appearing naturally attached without any signs of floating or clipping issues. The harmony in visual elements shows that the editing process aimed for continuity with the meadow's floral environment, which indicates a thoughtful design approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the butterflyâ€™s body transformed into a straight, slender stalk that connects naturally to the head and base, with no visible breaks or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the butterfly has been artistically modified into a slender, straight stalk that connects with fluid continuity from the head to the base. There are no visual cues indicating breaks or misaligned segments, which implies a coherent and continuous transformation design. This transformation mirrors the way a plant stem would naturally connect, emphasizing natural coherence in the editing process.",
