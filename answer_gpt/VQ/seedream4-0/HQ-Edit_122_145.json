      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The limbs of the chibi characters in Image B appear to be straight and well-connected.

Each limb is connected smoothly at the joints without showing any kinks or disproportionate lengths, which is characteristic of well-rendered chibi characters.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi charactersâ€™ floral patterns are distinctly visible with sharp edges in Image B.

      "question": "Is the hand holding the cherry blossom branch composed of five fingers with natural curvature and no extra digits or deformed shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character holding the cherry blossom branch is designed with stylized hands that fit the aesthetic of chibi art, rather than realistic human anatomy. Typically, chibi characters simplify features to emphasize cuteness, often using minimal lines to depict hands. Despite this artistic style, the character's hand reflects a coherent and purposeful design, free from deformities or extra digits.",

      "question": "Do the falling petals in the dancing pose follow a downward arc consistent with gravity, and are they evenly distributed without clustering or floating above the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The petals surrounding the chibi character in a dancing pose portray a natural, downward trajectory consistent with the effects of gravity. They are distributed evenly around the character and do not exhibit any clustering or improbable positioning that would otherwise defy gravitational dynamics, maintaining the visual coherence of movement in the artwork.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The magnetic sheet background in Image B displays a uniform pastel color with no discernible texture artifacts, stripes, or shifts in color across the surface. The consistency in the background's coloration suggests a digitally smooth and uninterrupted expanse, characteristic of well-detailed editing.",
