      "question": "Does the cartoon locomotive maintain the structural coherence of the original train without introducing broken or distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon locomotive maintains a coherent and consistent structure reminiscent of a traditional train design, though simplified and stylized in a chibi style. The shapes are rounded and exaggerated, typical of chibi designs, but all parts like the locomotive body, wheels, and cabin are correctly proportioned and connected logically, without any broken or distorted geometric shapes. Given that the core visuals of a train are preserved, considering the artistic style, the structural integrity is maintained.",

      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive harmonize well with the slightly stylized yet semi-realistic countryside background without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive features vibrant colors and bold outlines which match the stylized representation of the countryside background with its bright grass, clear blue sky, and colorful flowers. The elements complement each other, creating a cohesive and well-integrated appearance. Both the locomotive and the background share a playful and brightly colored aesthetic that ensures the train does not look out of place amidst the surroundings.",

      "question": "Are the textures and details of the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive natural and free from any obvious artifacts or unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the cartoon locomotive are smooth and consistent, with a deliberate choice of colors and shading to enhance its chibi style. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural patterns that disrupt the overall aesthetic, and the details like the smiley face and simplified structural elements are neatly rendered. The textures align with the intended stylized approach, contributing to an appealing and cohesive visual representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rolling green hills, bright blue sky, and colorful flowers in the background appear visually plausible and consistent with the semi-realistic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background including the rolling green hills, bright blue sky, and colorful flowers displays a slightly stylized, semi-realistic interpretation of a countryside scene. It is visually consistent with an animated environment where elements are exaggerated for effect but remain plausible within the portrayed world. The harmony of colors and the seamless blending of elements create a coherent visual narrative that remains attractive and believable within the context of a 3D animated scene.",
