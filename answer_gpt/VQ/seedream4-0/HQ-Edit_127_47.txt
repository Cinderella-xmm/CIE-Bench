    "Question": "Q1: Are the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb correctly proportioned and undistorted despite the spherical enclosure, with no visible warping or bending of vertical lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb are depicted with care to maintain proportions. The vertical lines of the trees and contours of the mountains remain consistent without noticeable warping or distortion indicative of the optical effects typically seen in curved glass surfaces. By using common sense knowledge of optics and visual effects provided in this type of enclosure, it can be deduced that these elements are rendered intentionally undistorted. Therefore, the proportionality is accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducks retain their natural body shape and size relative to the water and rocks, with smooth, reflective surfaces that do not show exaggerated shine or unnatural specular highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the ducks with a natural and proportionate body shape relative to the surrounding water and rocks within the orb. The ducks maintain realism, without exaggerated shine that would suggest artificiality. The degree of smoothness and reflectivity is typical for duck figurines, suggesting a reflection more akin to polished surfaces rather than plasticky highlights. This maintains the natural aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the water beneath the ducks transparent enough to clearly see the rocky bottom, with no visible layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the water beneath the ducks within the orb is clear enough to reveal the rocky bottom, which is visible without artifacts or tiling that would suggest image editing issues. There are no unnatural variations in opacity, ensuring the underwater scene appears coherent and continuous. This is a logical representation consistent with glass sphere displays showcasing clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature animal figurines positioned on solid surfaces (rocks or ground), properly scaled compared to surrounding elements, and free from floating or unnatural shadows?",
    "explanation": "The animal figurines in Image B are positioned on visible solid surfaces like rocks, which provides a stable and logical base. These figurines seem well-integrated into the scene, with scaling that aligns with the surrounding elements, portraying a reasonable size for miniature figures in context. The shadows cast by these figures appear natural and consistent with the scene's light source, avoiding any floaty appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}
{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wood base have a natural grain pattern and cast a consistent shadow under the orb, indicating physical contact and realistic lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wood base features a natural grain pattern typically found in real wooden surfaces, adding authenticity to the representation. Shadows beneath the orb are consistent and align with the sceneâ€™s lighting direction, signaling physical contact and realistic interaction between the orb and its base, indicative of correct shadow rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
