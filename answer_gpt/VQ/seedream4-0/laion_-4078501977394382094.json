      "question": "Does the roof of the van in Panel 1 tilt upward at a plausible angle without distorting the side panels or creating visible seams or breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the provided edited image (Image B), the van in Panel 1 shows its roof tilting upwards as part of a stylized design characterized by exaggerated, cartoonish features. The upward tilt is plausibly integrated into the van's overall curvature without causing visible seams or structural breaks in its side panels, maintaining a seamless and cohesive look. This is a hallmark of stylization where exaggerated perspectives and angles are employed to create a whimsical effect often seen in cartoons and illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cactus in Panel 2 transformed into a spout with continuous curves and matching texture, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 2 has a cactus transformed into a whimsical spout, a reflection of creative illustration choices. The spout extension retains the continuous curves and the texture typical of a cactus, integrating smoothly into it. The shadow cast by the cactus correlates with the light source direction, as observed in Panel 1, suggesting continuity in lighting throughout the artwork. The shadow's angle and length add to the credibility of the consistent light source employed in the entire image.",

      "question": "Are the newly added plants around the oasis in Panel 3 rendered with the same level of detail and color harmony as the original cacti, and do they cast shadows that align with the scene’s lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Panel 3 of Image B, the additional plants encircling the oasis exhibit a harmonious color palette, falling in line with the overall vibrant and smooth textures distinctive of the original art style. They match the detailed cartoonish rendering of the original cacti from earlier panels. The shadows of these plants are consistent with the angled lighting used across the panels, suggesting a unified light source concept that adds to the immersion of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles in all three panels positioned so they do not overlap critical parts of the van or landscape, and do they use a font style and size that matches the handwritten \"Road Trip\" title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the placement of text bubbles avoids overlapping essential elements of the van or landscape in each panel. Each bubble is strategically positioned to complement the scenic narrative. However, the font style and size of these text bubbles differ from the handwritten 'Road Trip' title in Image A. The title is distinct with its handwritten character, while the text in the bubbles uses a more standard comic font style, showcasing a complementary yet distinct choice that resonates with the stylized context but does not match the handwriting aesthetic exactly.",

      "question": "Do the water splashes in Panel 3 show droplets with varied sizes and arcing paths, and do they appear to originate from the van’s side without floating unnaturally above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water splashes around the van in Panel 3 of Image B demonstrate varied droplet sizes and believable arcing paths, enhancing motion perception. They naturally emanate from the van’s movement in the water without appearing suspended or disconnected, maintaining continuity with the physics of splashing water, which is crucial for cinematic realism and adds dynamism and depth to the scene.",

      "question": "Are the headlights in Panel 2 enlarged and brightened but still contained within the original housing, and do they retain their round shape without stretching or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Panel 2 in Image B, the headlights are depicted as more prominent and illuminated, enhancing their visibility and impact in the illustration. Despite this enlargement and brightness enhancement, they remain encased within the original housing design, preserving their round-shaped integrity without experiencing distortion or evident clipping. This consistency supports a stylized yet realistic enhancement suitable for eye-catching cartoon representation.",
