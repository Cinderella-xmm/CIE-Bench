    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head-to-body ratio is exaggerated, reminiscent of a chibi or cartoon-like style. Despite this exaggerated proportion, the rest of the body is in alignment, maintaining a structurally coherent posture, without any apparent distortion or misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, consistent porcelain-like surface with no rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B has a smooth, shiny finish that is characteristic of a porcelain or plastic material. It lacks any rough patches or texture artifacts and does not display unnatural glare, maintaining a consistent surface appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamb in Image B appears to have a rounded and voluminous shape with a texture that suggests softness. It rests naturally within the figureâ€™s hands, without any visible clipping or floating, making it look realistically positioned.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is horizontally aligned with the foreground plane, and there are no visible shadows that suggest incorrect lighting or floating effects. It blends seamlessly with the background, providing a stable support for the figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the eyes proportionally enlarged but symmetrically placed, with no distortion in shape or spacing relative to the nose and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The description of the face should be omitted, thus this particular point cannot be evaluated. Refer to the rest of the image for accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the right hand is holding the lamb with visible fingers that are proportionally sized, the left hand gripping the lamb might be partially obscured, not allowing clear identification of all five fingers due to their positioning. However, based on typical design completeness, it's reasonable to conclude that each hand is normally designed with five fingers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace and pendant in Image B appear clear and well-defined, displaying a consistent metallic texture without pixelation or blurring. Their edges are sharp, suggesting good rendering quality.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B retains a consistent sky gradient, horizon line, and mountain silhouette, matching the original scenery style. There are no visible seams or color shifts that disrupt the visual continuity of the landscape.",
