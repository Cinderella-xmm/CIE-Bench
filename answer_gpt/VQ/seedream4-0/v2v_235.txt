    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi rendition of the dancer follows typical proportions associated with chibi-style art, which often includes a larger head and simplified body structure. Despite these stylizations, the portrayal maintains a consistent proportion across its features, consistent with chibi design principles, rather than introducing unnatural geometric distortions. The limbs and pose align with the exaggerations commonly found in chibi depictions, designed to be charming rather than realistically proportioned. Therefore, within the context of chibi art, the proportions are natural and intentional.",
