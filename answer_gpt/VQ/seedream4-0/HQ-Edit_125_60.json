    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns on the transformed tagine's surface smooth and continuous, without visible artifacts such as broken lines, abrupt color shifts, or unnatural texture blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved patterns on the tagine are continuous and smoothly integrated into the design. The patterns are detailed and intricate, with consistent coloration and texture, suggesting careful rendering and a high level of detail consistent with finely engraved art. There are no abrupt color shifts or broken lines, and the texture blending is natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the extended spout emerge seamlessly from the top of the tagine, maintaining consistent curvature and structural continuity without any visible gaps, warping, or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spout in Image B is smoothly integrated into the tagine, with consistent curvature and structural continuity. It appears proportional to the rest of the tagine and does not show any visible gaps or warping. The scaling looks appropriate and balanced, fitting the style and design concept of the transformed tagine.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the smoke beneath the tagine rendered with soft diffusion and layered opacity, showing realistic lighting effects and no sharp outlines or blocky textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smoke in Image B is depicted with soft edges and layered opacity, creating a natural diffusion effect. The lighting on the smoke enhances its realistic appearance, with gradual changes in color and brightness. There are no sharp outlines or blocky textures, ensuring that the smoke integrates seamlessly with the surrounding imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floating orbs derived from the original ingredients (such as lemon, lime, garlic) maintain recognizable shapes and emit a soft glow without visible rendering artifacts like haloing, misaligned highlights, or floating disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating orbs in Image B maintain recognizable spherical shapes and emit a soft glow with a consistent lighting effect. They appear well-rendered without haloing or misaligned highlights. The colors are vibrant, glowing seamlessly without disconnected fragments or rendering artifacts that could disrupt their visual integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the materials of the transformed tagine (ceramic body, engraved surface) and surrounding elements (floating orbs, smoke) visually consistent with their expected physical properties, without unnatural sheen, flat shading, or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed tagine, floating orbs, and smoke are rendered in Image B with attention to their physical properties. The ceramic and engraved materials have a natural surface and detailed texture. The sheen is expected and realistic, and there is no flat shading or loss of fine details. These elements maintain visual consistency in terms of lighting, texture, and material properties, supporting the magical theme of the image.",
