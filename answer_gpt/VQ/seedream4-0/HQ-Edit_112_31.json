      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the horseâ€™s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which features a plush horse, the head proportions appear to be designed to be cute and chibi-like, with the head being relatively larger compared to the body. However, this depiction is typical of plush toys, designed to exaggerate cuteness rather than distort features in an unappealing way. The eyes and muzzle are clear and undistorted, consistent with the stylized design of plush toys aimed at enhancing a cute appearance without sacrificing clarity or recognizability.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a plush horse with a generally uniform fabric texture that appears soft and inviting, as is typical of plush toys. The surface is non-reflective, suggesting a material like felt or a similar textile. There are no sharp or abrupt transitions between the different colored sections of the plush horse's body, indicating high-quality craftsmanship where seams are hidden or minimized.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the plush horse depicted with visible stitching patterns and raised texture consistent with embroidery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse's facial features, particularly the eyes and mouth, lack visible stitching patterns. They appear smoothly integrated into the plush, typical of some plush toys that use printed or closely attached features rather than embroidery. There is no noticeable raised texture that would indicate standard embroidery stitches.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush horse in Image B has legs consistent with a stylized plush design, where the legs are intentionally made short and thick, contributing to a cute and cuddly appearance. The shapes are smooth and rounded, with no evidence of unnatural distortion or broken geometry, reinforcing the typical simplicity and appeal of a plush toy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dandelions in the foreground composed of flat, circular felt-like discs on straight stems, lacking naturalistic detail or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of dandelions seems simplified and stylized consistent with the background of a plush toy display. They are represented as flatter, circular shapes on upright stems, which gives the impression of a deliberate craft-style design, lacking intricate detail and mimicking felt in appearance rather than realistic flora.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest background in Image B appears flat and simplified, typical of a backdrop for a plush toy presentation. There are painted or printed tree shapes, but these lack overlapping elements and depth cues such as shading or atmospheric perspective, reinforcing the concept of it being a mere decorative background rather than a three-dimensional environment.",
