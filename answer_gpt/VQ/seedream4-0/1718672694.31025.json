      "question": "Do the two central tree trunks retain the original towers' vertical proportions and cylindrical form without unnatural tapering or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trunks have replaced the towers from Image A. They maintain a vertical orientation and cylindrical form that resembles the original towers. There is no noticeable unnatural tapering or distortion, preserving the overall structure and silhouette seen in Image A. The trunk shapes follow typical tree growth patterns, where trunks are generally cylindrical and vertical.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branches extending from the trunks seamlessly connected and positioned in a way that follows natural growth patterns, without floating or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B appear to extend from the trunks naturally, following typical growth patterns where branches diverge from the main trunk and spread out. They are seamlessly connected and there are no visible inconsistencies such as gaps or floating segments. This is consistent with how tree branches grow in real life, where they naturally have a solid base on the trunk.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing leaves at the top of the structure emit a soft, diffused green light that blends with ambient lighting and does not produce sharp halos or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing leaves in Image B emit a soft, diffused green light that harmonizes with the surrounding ambient light. The glow does not create sharp halos or areas of overexposure, indicating an even diffusion of light. This suggests a controlled and realistic representation of light emission where the glow is soft and not overwhelming.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the root-like spirit figures embedded in the ground smoothly blended with the terrain and free of visible pixelation, edge artifacts, or unnatural translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the root-like spirit figures are integrated smoothly with the ground, showing a natural blending with the terrain. There is no visible pixelation or edge artifacts, and the translucency is applied in a way that appears realistic, avoiding unnatural effects. These figures harmonize with the environment without abrupt transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bark textures on the trunks and branches show variation in shading and detail consistent with real tree surfaces, without uniform patterns or repeated brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bark textures in Image B exhibit variation in shading and detail, which is characteristic of real tree surfaces. The natural irregularities in texture and coloration are present, avoiding uniform patterns or the appearance of repeated brush strokes. This provides a realistic depiction of tree bark, enhancing the authenticity of the image.",
