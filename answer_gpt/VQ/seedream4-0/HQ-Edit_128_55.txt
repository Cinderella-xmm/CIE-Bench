    "Question": "Q1: Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the feathered wing extensions appear to be a layered design added to the door, meant to resemble a bird's wings. These feathers cover parts of the original wood grain and carvings visible in Image A. Upon examination, these extensions do not maintain consistent wood grain with the rest of the door, as they differ in texture, representing feathers rather than wood. Additionally, the transitions from the wood panel to the feather extensions are not smooth, but rather visibly distinct and separate from the wood carvings. This indicates a deliberate stylistic addition meant to contrast with the existing design.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes appear as glowing features within the owl's head at the top of the door, positioned above the original design seen in Image A. These eyes do not correspond with any iron studs seen in Image A's design; instead, they are completely new elements with their distinct glow. The studs in Image A are arranged along the door's panel, none of which are intended or designed to form glowing eyes as seen in Image B. Thus, there are no iron studs that are repurposed or incorrectly embedded to form these eyes.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crown is positioned above the owl's head and is embellished with star-like glimmers. Within this context, despite being added to the arch shape in Image A, the crown does not maintain the arch's continuous curvature and appears more as an accessory placed above the original structure. The crown does not seamlessly integrate with the arch, as it is distinctly separate with its own structure and design, which may cause it to appear as floating rather than seamlessly integrated into the arch.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the etched runes visible across the door’s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the runes etched onto the door’s surface alter the original carving design seen in Image A. These runes introduce new symbols and characters that are visibly distinct from the existing patterns and carvings on the door. They are colored and illuminated differently, which may cause them to disrupt the continuity of the existing carvings. As a result, the depth and lighting of these runes are not consistent with that of the original carvings, and there is interference with the existing patterns.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cloak-like structure resembles a fabric drape surrounding the door frame, intended as a decorative addition. This structure incorporates realistic fabric folds and shadows, contrasting with the backdrop of the stone frame seen in Image A. The structure appears to maintain consistent lighting and blends it with the surrounding lighting conditions. Furthermore, it adheres to the stone frame contours without visible gaps or awkward distortions, although it creates an additional visual layer over the original door frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
