      "question": "Do the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head, without warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial sails take the place of the elephant's ears. The attachment points at the base of the ears are consistent with the natural positioning on the elephant's head. The size and shape of these sails are large but appear proportionally consistent with typical elephant ears. There is no visible warping or stretching of the surrounding skin, suggesting a smooth integration of the sails onto the elephant's head.",

      "question": "Is the cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk smoothly integrated into the scene without jagged edges, overlapping artifacts, or inconsistent opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cosmic mist at the tip of the elephant's trunk in Image B is smoothly blended into the scene. It has a soft, ethereal quality typical of mist, with even opacity throughout. There are no visible jagged edges or overlapping artifacts that disrupt its integration with the trunk or the surrounding environment.",

      "question": "Are the planetary rings around the elephant's legs evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes, without clipping into the leg surface or appearing misaligned due to perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The planetary rings around the elephant's legs in Image B appear to be evenly spaced and properly aligned with the limbs. They do not visibly clip into the surface of the legs or appear misaligned, despite the perspective of the image, which suggests an accurate positional rendering that respects the limb's axis.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it, with no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent star patterns on the elephant's feet appear to visually blend as if part of the skin, embedded within the surface rather than floating. There is no discernible haloing or color spill onto the adjacent areas, indicating these features are well-integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the galaxy-patterned skin follow the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution and avoiding abrupt transitions or stretched patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The galaxy-patterned skin in Image B follows the natural folds and creases of the elephant's body, maintaining consistent texture resolution. The transitions between the galaxy pattern and the natural texture of the skin are smooth, without any visible abrupt changes or stretched patterns. This suggests that the texture application has been done with attention to the natural contoured surfaces of the elephant.",
