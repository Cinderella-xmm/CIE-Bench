    "Question": "Q1: Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic widgets and 3D elements are projected over the smartphone screen which indicates a futuristic representation, often characterized by floating or augmented reality elements. For them to appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, they should maintain consistent depth cues and shadowing in alignment with the phone's physical form. The holographic elements seem to be floating slightly above the screen, as expected in augmented realities, but they do not show integration onto the phone's actual screen surface in the way physical applications would, hence the integration isn't as seamless.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the forward-projection effect from the smartphone screen is illustrated through holographic effects extending above and around the screen. For the projection effect to be visually coherent, there should be no warping of the phone's frame or screen edges, maintaining a proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it. The projection does not distort the frame or interfere with the screen's edges, and it maintains a natural spatial relationship with the hand, evident by the hand's grip on the phone not appearing altered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is a holographic overlay over the hand, representing a biometric hand scan. For precise alignment, this overlay should match the hand's anatomy in terms of finger positions and proportions without any distortion. The overlay aligns well in terms of finger positions, capturing the natural biology of a hand without adding any extra fingers or distorting proportions, ensuring an accurate representation with respect to the hand being scanned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a futuristic skyline on the laptop screen. For a consistent presentation, it must maintain proper geometry and perspective that aligns with the laptop display and does not exhibit clipping outside of the screen area or improper alignment with the bezel. The skyline sits well within the screen boundaries with natural look, indicating consistency in perspective and alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the smartphone and laptop displays utilize a blue color palette and futuristic interface elements, including typography, which suggests a cohesive design approach across the two devices. These consistent design elements ensure harmonized styles and visual coherence across the technology narrative being presented. There are no noticeable instances of conflicting styles between the smartphone and laptop displays.",
    "answer": "Yes"
