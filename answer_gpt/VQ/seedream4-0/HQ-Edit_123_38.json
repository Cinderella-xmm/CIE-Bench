      "question": "Does the brushstroke effect cover the figure evenly without disrupting the outline of limbs, head, or torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke effect is applied primarily to the upper part of the leg but does not disrupt the figure's outline. The limbs, head, and torso maintain clear and distinct outlines. The use of brushstrokes adds artistic flair without hindering the recognizability of the gymnast's form. Hence, the brushstroke effect is used in a way that maintains the figure's outline, demonstrating a carefully applied artistic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, and do they maintain natural joint alignment and skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted hand is altered to have an artistic style, with fingers less distinct and more stylized, meaning they lack detailed anatomical accuracy. The textured detail and natural alignment seen in Image A are replaced by a smoother and simplified depiction without specific skin texture or joint definition.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the elongated legs form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet without abrupt bends or discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs are elongated and appear stylized as a single continuous curve from the hips to the feet, maintaining a graceful line that follows a natural arc typical of a gymnast's pose. No abrupt bends or discontinuities are visible, indicating a smooth representation.",

      "question": "Are the blue and silver gradients smoothly blended across the leotard and skin, without visible banding or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue and silver gradients on the leotard and skin transition smoothly, exhibiting an artistic application that maintains cohesive coloration. There is no evident banding or unnatural highlights, providing a seamlessly blended visual appearance suitable for an illustrative style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the swirling ribbons and stars placed around the figure in a manner that follows the direction of movement and does not intersect with the body or balance beam?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The swirling ribbons and stars in Image B are arranged to encircle the gymnast, enhancing the sense of movement and energy. They do not overlap or intersect with the body or the apparatus (balance beam), reinforcing a clean and dynamic composition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the matt-finish panel with rounded corners is clearly visible and forms a complete border around the image. This border does not interfere with the portrayal of the gymnast or the background, maintaining its intended visual boundary without any parts being cut off.",
