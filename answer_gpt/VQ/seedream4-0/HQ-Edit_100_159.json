      "question": "Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player has exaggerated muscles that are typical in an animated or stylized form, yet they are still anatomically plausible without any distortions or broken geometry. The stylized art maintains the general proportions and symmetry that are consistent with human anatomy, indicating that even with exaggeration, the portrayal stays believable and coherent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors applied to the player's clothing and skin consistent with the graffiti theme and do they retain visible texture and material properties without appearing flat or artificially oversaturated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vibrant and consistent with the dynamic, colorful style typical of graffiti art. They do blend well with the background, sharing a lively and cohesive theme. However, being a stylized artwork, some texture details are simplified, but they do not appear unreasonably flat or overly saturated, maintaining a balance between vibrancy and texture.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's hand shows the correct number of fingers with a natural curvature and spacing consistent with how a hand would grip a basketball. The positioning and grip appear physically credible and appropriate for the action depicted, without any anatomical inaccuracies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank graffiti-style text area clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the background graffiti, and placed in a way that does not distort the scene or obscure key elements?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blank area intended for graffiti-style text maintains consistency with the overall vibrant and urban theme of the background graffiti.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases consistent lighting and shading across the player, basketball, and court, with no visible artifacts or mismatching highlights that would disrupt visual coherence.
