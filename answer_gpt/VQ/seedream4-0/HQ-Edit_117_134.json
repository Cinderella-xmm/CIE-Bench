      "question": "Does the surface of the piano exhibit a uniform caramel color with visible white and gold icing details that resemble real edible decoration, without unnatural textures or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembling a piano is crafted using a cookie with decorations. The surface clearly shows a uniform caramel color typical of baked goods. White and gold decorations resembling icing are visible, indicative of real edible decoration, and these do not display any unusual textures or digital artifacts which would suggest a manipulated or non-authentic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and spatial relationships of the pianoâ€™s components (lid, body, legs, pedals) preserved and correctly aligned, with no visible deformation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is a cookie decorated to resemble elements found in a grand piano but not replicating its structural components like lid, body, legs, or pedals; these parts do not exist in the decorated cookie. Therefore, there can be no judgment of proportions or alignments related to these components, suggesting distortion from the original piano concept.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a decorated cookie whose color does not transition from black to caramel, illustrating a singular caramel-toned appearance typical of baked goods, without the described gradient transition from black. Furthermore, it does not interact with the room's lighting with such complexity as suggested.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the keys appear as distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard, with no missing or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cookie decoration in Image B visually attempts to represent a keyboard with icing. The 'keys' are formed using icing but do not appear as sugar crystals, nor do they display a precise pattern. They are irregular and do not denote the expected aligned pattern akin to a real keyboard setup, presenting a mismatched appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white marble tabletop beneath the piano flat, properly scaled, and displaying natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble tabletop under the decorated cookie does appear flat and shows natural stone patterns. The shadows cast on it align reasonably with the chandelier above, suggesting proper interaction with the light source. This scene is naturally scaled to fit the relative positioning in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cookie's decoration in Image B displays clean edges typical of well-defined icing work. There is no visible pixelation or smudging at the boundaries of the cookie's decorative elements, presenting a naturally crafted piece without digital artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie decoration and its setup present shadows that interact naturally with a presumed light source from above. While shadows match lighting direction reasonably, they differ from the lighting interaction seen in a traditional piano setup, instead showing alignment with the tabletop appearance and light reflection.",
