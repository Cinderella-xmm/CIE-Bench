      "question": "Does the outdoor café table appear to have a natural wood texture and color, consistent with the existing glass cups?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table does not showcase a wood texture or color; instead, it appears to have a smooth and likely metal or composite surface, reflecting the outdoor setting of the café. This contrasts with the glass cups, which remain unchanged with their transparent material. The lack of wood texture suggests a more modern or minimalist café table design, which may not be consistent with the typical café scene featuring wooden elements.",

      "question": "Is the snowy cabin in the background seamlessly integrated into the scene without noticeable edges or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy cabin in the background is integrated with smooth blending, as there are no noticeable edges or abrupt changes in the scene where the cabin meets the snow and surrounding trees. This indicates a seamless integration, which is visually harmonious and consistent with real-world scenes of cabins in snowy environments.",

      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glasses match the lighting conditions of the new snowy cabin background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflections and shadows on the glasses in Image B are consistent with the snowy cabin background lighting. The light source appears to be from the cabin's window lights and the ambient outdoor lighting, creating soft shadows on the table. This suggests that the reflections and lighting conditions have been adjusted adequately to match the new background, maintaining the overall coherence of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sizes and proportional relationships between the two glasses and the outdoor café table natural and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sizes of the glasses relative to the outdoor café table appear natural. The glasses are proportionally adequate, meaning they are not too large or too small compared to what one would expect in a real-world café setting. The perspective aligns realistically, suggesting that the proportions are physically plausible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam rising from the glasses look natural and consistent with the new outdoor café setting without any artificial interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam in Image B rises naturally from the glasses, consistent with an outdoor setting. The steam behavior is coherent with how it would appear in cold surroundings, where it is more visible. There are no signs of artificial interruptions, such as abrupt changes in the steam's flow or unnatural patterns, indicating a realistic depiction.",
