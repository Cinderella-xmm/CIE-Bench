    "Question": "Q1: Are the gorilla's hands holding the bananas with five fingers each, and do the fingers have natural curvature and skin texture without deformation?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the gorilla's hands are depicted holding a bunch of bananas. Upon close observation, the fingers appear to have a natural curvature and skin texture, which aligns with a realistic depiction of gorilla hands.
