      "question": "Does the womanâ€™s face exhibit natural contours and shading without visible unnatural textures or blotches in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the watercolor transformation smooths out details, giving soft, blended contours typical of the style. This involves using light washes and soft transitions between colors, eliminating harsh textures or blotches. Hence, the woman's face, while blurred, maintains the natural contours typical of watercolor artworks.",

      "question": "Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in the watercolor-styled image are outlined with soft, light lines and washes, characteristic of this form, simplifying their details while maintaining overall form. There's no evidence of geometric breaks, and the shapes are consistent without awkward disruptions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the woman's hand in a watercolor style, where the fingers appear naturally curved and spaced, fitting the simplified yet realistic aspect of this art form. There are no apparent artifacts or unnatural shapes disrupting the hand's form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the watercolor-styled image, the wine glass is depicted with transparency, illustrated by soft reflections and highlights aligned with real glass properties. Though details are simplified, they aren't excessively stylized such that the realism is lost; it retains the delicate balance observed in typical watercolor artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains spatial and lighting realism, where shadows around the woman, glass, and table are naturally placed, suggesting appropriate depth and contact points. There are no signs of distortion or floating, maintaining consistency in spatial orientation after the watercolor transformation.",
