    "Question": "Q1: Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon eye is designed with careful attention to detail, featuring smooth gradients and consistent lighting that enhances its realistic appearance. The glow is natural and well-integrated into the design, suggesting a high-quality digital rendering. There are no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or glow artifacts, which confirms the image quality is well-maintained in these characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "The silver scales around the band in Image B are intricately detailed and consistently aligned, providing a continuous geometric pattern that mimics realistic dragon scales. The shading is consistent, contributing to a natural metallic texture without any gaps or overlapping that would disturb the continuity of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?",
    "explanation": "The glowing neural node on the watch case in Image B integrates seamlessly with the watch's structure. The illumination is consistent, maintaining a smooth and even glow that does not leak or distort the surrounding design. This integration highlights the precision of the visual effects used to maintain device coherence and aesthetic appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?",
    "explanation": "The control sigils depicted on the watch face in Image B maintain precise boundaries, showing well-defined shapes and consistent brightness. These elements are rendered without signs of blurring or ghosting, ensuring each sigil appears clear and retains its intended vibrance without sacrificing image quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?",
    "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, all components such as the case, band, crown, and side button are proportionally aligned. Each element adheres to a coherent structural design without any visible warping, stretching, or misplacement. The watch maintains a balanced and realistic appearance, upholding the integrity of its fantastical design within a believable framework.",
    "answer": "Yes"
