    "Question": "Q1: Does the ogre's body have simplified yet coherent proportions with no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's body is designed as a cartoonish figure, which naturally simplifies and exaggerates certain features for stylistic effect. Despite this cartoonish style, the proportions are coherent with typical representations of animated characters, showing no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles. The limbs and joints are in positions that appear stable and balanced, consistent with common design principles for cartoon figures.",

    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the cape is clearly visible, attached at the ogre’s shoulders, and appears to extend downward in a natural flow. The cape retains its position and form without any visible clipping into the body, which would cause visual disruption, or appearing detached, ensuring it follows real-world physical behavior in a stylized manner.",
