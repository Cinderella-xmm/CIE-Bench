    "Question": "Q1: Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs are distinctly made of LEGO bricks, which are universally known for their uniform size and interlocking ability due to the precise mold design. The bricks appear consistent in their dimensions, and their edges are clean and fit neatly together without visible breaks or misalignments. This aligns with the typical characteristics of LEGO constructions, which are expected to have a seamless appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
    "explanation": "The tabletop and chair seats in Image B show a texture composed of repeating LEGO stud patterns, which is characteristic of LEGO constructions, where each brick has a uniform size and design for interlocking. There is no visible distortion or stretching of the bricks or studs, implying a consistent texture associated with LEGO builds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
    "explanation": "The central element on the table in Image B is a cluster of LEGO bricks forming a plant-like structure, with the typical blocky appearance of LEGO bricks used to emulate leaf shapes. The structure is positioned centrally on the table without floating or overlapping, which is consistent with LEGO's strict placement constraints.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the furniture is placed on a flat baseplate resembling a large LEGO baseplate known for its structural use in LEGO settings. The baseplate correctly fits under the furniture, but a visible seam exists between the gray baseplate and the real ground, suggesting an imperfect integration without snug fit.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
    "explanation": "Image B has been altered to make the furniture appear as if made from LEGO bricks. The furniture does not show any visible artifacts like jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural shadowing, which are signs of digital artifacting due to incomplete rendering, suggesting a well-integrated alteration with the background.",
    "answer": "No"
