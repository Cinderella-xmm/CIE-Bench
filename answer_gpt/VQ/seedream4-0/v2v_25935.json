      "question": "Do the Lego bricks representing the cobblestone path maintain a natural appearance without introducing obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone path is composed of small, flat, rounded Lego bricks arranged to mimic a cobblestone texture. Lego pieces, by their nature, have a distinct plastic surface, which is a characteristic feature of Lego designs. The arrangement accurately represents the intended cobblestone effect without introducing discrepancies in alignment, shape, or texture beyond the expected Lego style. This maintains consistency with the natural look within the context of Lego materials.",

      "question": "Are the Lego brick structures of the buildings coherent and visually credible, without any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings alongside the street are constructed using Lego bricks with distinct, well-aligned edges and corners. The Lego bricks fit together in such a way that they maintain the intended architectural form and integrity of the structures without any breakage or deformation of the geometric Lego shapes. The cleanliness and coherence of these shapes are in line with how Lego structures are typically built.",

      "question": "Does the man's figure in the Lego diorama retain proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding unnatural body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is a classic Lego minifigure with standardized proportions typical of Lego characters. These proportions include a block-like torso, articulated limbs, and a rounded head, all of which are consistent with the design of Lego figures. Although these proportions are not human-like, they fit the aesthetic and functional rationale of Lego minifigures, maintaining a coherent appearance within that context.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the man's clothing and accessories been preserved in the Lego diorama without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's attire and accessories are simplified into Lego form. The clothing consists of solid-colored items without detailed textures, which is typical for Lego minifigures. The briefcase, while simplified, is recognizable in shape and fits well with the Lego aesthetic. As these details are intentionally minimal and stylized due to the nature of Lego design, they do not include any inappropriate artifacts, maintaining the expected look.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the briefcase in the Lego diorama appear natural with correct ergonomics, lines, and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand is part of the Lego minifigure structure, which features a simple, claw-like design that is open for holding objects like the briefcase. The design allows the briefcase to be securely held using the standardized minifigure grip, which is ergonomically appropriate for a Lego minifigure and serves its purpose within the Lego universe. The lines and texture match the overall simplicity of Lego components.",
