      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic tiles appear to be evenly distributed across the teddy bears' surfaces. The tiles are consistent in size and alignment, which indicates a meticulous arrangement. The visual cues, such as the tightly packed tiles and their uniform spacing, suggest deliberate craftsmanship to maintain coherence across the mosaic surface, preventing visible gaps or misalignment common in tile artworks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the bears' sweaters appear to follow the original shapes and contours effectively. The visual cues indicate that the geometric patterning aligns well with the body structure, maintaining the original sweater design, which prevents any warping or distortion of shapes, thereby adhering to the contours without disrupting geometric consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the teddy bears are portrayed using small shaded tiles that maintain clarity and proportionality. The distribution of color shades and tile sizes enhances facial definition while preventing misalignment that could obscure recognition. The visual cues, such as contrasted accents and precise tile placement, ensure that the eyes, nose, and mouth are distinct and proportionally correct.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the bows of the teddy bears are rendered to retain their original shape. They exhibit a smooth reflective surface that contrasts distinctively with the textured mosaic tiles of the fur. The visual indication of gloss and shape preservation confirms meticulous editing. The choice of reflective tiles for the bows enhances contrast, complementing the mosaic's varied textures without distorting the overall aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white pedestal beneath the teddy bears appears well-grounded, with no evident gaps or floating effects. It maintains clean edges and a consistent color throughout its surface. The uniformity in color and sharp, defined edges indicate careful alignment and editing, ensuring the pedestal serves as a stable base that contrasts with the mosaic bears without blending issues.",
