      "question": "Does the dog's body maintain a natural and structurally consistent pose in the chibi-style, without any noticeable distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is depicted in a chibi-style, which usually involves exaggerating certain features like the head while maintaining a cute and stylized aesthetic. The body is proportionate to this stylistic choice, maintaining consistency in terms of the chibi theme. There are no unnatural distortions or deformations evident, as the design aims for a playful and cohesive appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the enlarged head been integrated naturally into the image, without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The enlarged head in Image B follows the chibi-style which typically involves an overly large head for cuteness. The integration of the head into the overall model is smooth, with clean lines and appropriate color matching. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural textures that disrupt the overall appearance, aligning with the intentional art style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball touching the dog's nose in a way that looks natural and physically plausible, without any awkward positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a chibi dog is shown with its nose almost touching a tennis ball. The positioning appears physically plausible within the confines of the chibi art style, where proportion and realism can be adjusted for cuteness and appealing aesthetics. The nose and ball are positioned in a way that fits the playful and stylized theme.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relief tennis ball pattern on the base match well with the rest of the scene, contributing to a cohesive and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The relief pattern on the base of Image B adds an element of texture that complements the main chibi figure. This subtle detail enhances the overall aesthetic without clashing with other elements, such as the dog's figure or the tennis balls in the background. It integrates well and maintains the scene's playful and cohesive style.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the edited image retained the original focus on the ball while successfully integrating the chibi-style elements, resulting in a balanced and visually coherent composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a chibi dog interacting with a tennis ball, translating the original focus from Image A into the stylized form. The balance between the focal point (the ball) and the added elements (the chibi dog and surrounding designs) is well maintained. The enlarged chibi features do not overshadow the importance of the ball, ensuring the composition remains coherent and visually appealing.",
