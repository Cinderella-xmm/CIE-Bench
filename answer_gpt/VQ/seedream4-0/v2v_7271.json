      "question": "Are the brick textures and shapes of the building and the \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign consistent with Lego bricks, without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building and the 'LAUNDROMAT' sign are designed in a way that mimics the appearance of Lego bricks. The bricks are characterized by uniform rectangular shapes with smooth edges, typical of Lego. The sign's block-built appearance is consistent with the Lego theme as well. The visual cues suggest a seamless integration typical of brick-built constructions in Lego style, maintaining the coherence expected in such models.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the person holding the laundry appear naturally integrated into the Lego-style environment without any visible distortion or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted as a Lego minifigure, which is consistent with the style of the environment. The figure possesses the characteristic features of Lego figures, such as a blocky, simplistic form and articulated joints. The integration appears natural, without visible distortion or blending issues, as the person fits well into the constructed Lego setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interior of the laundromat in Image B is crafted to resemble Lego brick constructions. The washing machines and other interior elements maintain structural integrity, with the blocky, modular shapes typical of Lego designs. The geometric shapes are well-preserved, without any breakage or distortion, indicative of a well-executed transition to a Lego style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of folded laundry is depicted as separate Lego bricks stacked on top of each other, mimicking layers of clothing. The laundry does not retain a natural fabric texture but adopts the standard plastic look typical of Lego blocks. Thus, the stack does not maintain a natural appearance as it is fully consistent with the Lego aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the scene, including the person, the laundry, and the laundromat, coherent and visually plausible as a stop-motion diorama crafted in the style of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B reflects a coherent diorama-style scene composed entirely of Lego bricks. The person, laundry, and laundromat are all depicted in a Lego format, creating a unified and visually plausible stop-motion effect. Each element is consistent with Lego's build-and-assemble aesthetic, contributing to a harmonized scene.",
