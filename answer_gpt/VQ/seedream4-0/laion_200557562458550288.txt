    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features added over the star motif proportionally aligned and integrated without distorting the star’s shape or creating unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the facial features cover part of the area where the star motif is located. Due to the added features, the visual symmetry and alignment may be questionable. Usually, when adding elements like facial features over a graphic motif, it's important to ensure that the underlying design (star motif) does not appear distorted or misaligned. However, since the facial features here are simple geometric representations, they might have been aligned without visible distortion of the star motif.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the motion lines surrounding the character have smooth, consistent strokes that align with the jersey's design language and do not exhibit pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines appear as sleek strokes emanating from the key visual element, which is consistent with the dynamic and sporty theme of the jersey. These lines are designed to enhance the perception of motion and speed. They look smooth and seamlessly integrate with the rest of the design, without visible pixelation or clipping, which indicates good design quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are all newly added elements (facial features, motion lines, tagline) rendered using only the original jersey’s color scheme (blue, white, red, gray), with no unintended color bleed or mismatch?",
    "explanation": "Considering Image B, the added elements such as facial features, motion lines, and the tagline use the same colors as the original jersey—blue, white, red, and gray. This choice ensures design cohesion and prevents any mismatched colors. The observed color palette in these elements is consistent with the original design intentions, maintaining a unified look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the tagline 'Ride Like a Star!' positioned diagonally in the bottom-left corner without overlapping or obscuring existing text or graphics, and is it clearly readable without distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tagline 'Ride Like a Star!' is placed diagonally in the bottom-left corner of the image. It is isolated from the main text and graphics in the jersey design and does not overlap or obstruct any existing elements. The text appears to be clearly readable and integrated into the overall design without distortion or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the fabric texture of the jersey, including the repeated 'DALLAS' pattern and mesh-like sections, remain intact and undistorted even in areas near the added facial features and motion lines?",
    "explanation": "Upon review of Image B, despite the addition of new design elements, the underlying fabric texture, repeated 'DALLAS' pattern, and mesh-like sections of the jersey appear to remain intact. These elements do not show signs of distortion and are well-preserved around the areas where new features have been added, indicating attention to detail in maintaining texture integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
