      "question": "Are the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders sharp and unaltered by the added shadowy textures or angular lines, with no visible distortion or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added shadowy textures and angular lines create a stylistic and vintage effect. These elements do not interfere with the sharpness of the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders. They remain well-defined, showing no visible distortion or ghosting, which indicates precision in maintaining the subject's contours despite the background changes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass appear integrated into the background without intersecting or distorting the man’s head or shoulders, and do they maintain consistent depth relative to the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass in Image B are artfully integrated into the sepia-toned background.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the sepia effect in Image B, the skin tones, facial hair, and fabric textures are altered with a warmer hue.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
