    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-style bricks on the building facade uniformly sized, aligned in rows, and free from visible texture repetition or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building facade is rendered using LEGO-style bricks. Each brick appears to be of uniform size and shape, consistent with standard LEGO pieces. They are aligned in rows, maintaining the orderly structure typical of LEGO construction. When inspecting for texture repetition or blurring, there are no visual inconsistencies or artifacts indicating irregularities, which suggests a careful alignment of these bricks. The regular size and order of the bricks offer a seamless visual appearance without any visible texture flaws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the window frames appear as solid, blocky LEGO elements with consistent thickness and alignment, matching the original window positions and sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are designed as solid, rectangular features typical of LEGO block construction. Each window frame exhibits consistent thickness and alignment, closely mirroring the position and dimensions visible in the original facade. This transformation preserves the architectural intent and proportions of the original while adopting a LEGO motif, ensuring the blocky elements maintain consistency with the real-world window layout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the green LEGO vines grow along the same vertical paths as the original plants, maintaining segmented, blocky forms without stretching or breaking continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original greenery has been replaced with LEGO-style vines that follow the same vertical paths as the real plants seen in Image A. These LEGO vines maintain a segmented, blocky appearance, characteristic of LEGO pieces, without any visual stretching or interruptions that would suggest a breakdown in continuity. The blocky structure of the vines ensures they appear as intentional constructs within the LEGO motif, paralleling the path of the original vines.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the gray LEGO railings on each balcony evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and securely connected to the balcony base without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each balcony features gray LEGO railings that are evenly spaced and maintain horizontal alignment. These railings are visually connected to the balcony bases in a secure manner, as seen in the precision of LEGO assembly. There are no indications of floating or incorrect overlapping, which would be inconsistent with the neat, interconnected nature of LEGO constructs. This careful assembly preserves the intended design of the original balconies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a flat, level platform extending beneath the entire building base, positioned consistently with the sidewalk and not overlapping with parked vehicles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no indication of a distinct LEGO-style platform or base beneath the building that deviates from its surroundings. The building's foundation appears to be correctly seated in line with the sidewalk, and there is no visible overlap with vehicles. This suggests that the building remains properly situated, replicating the real-world interaction between building, sidewalk, and street.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all architectural elements—including windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—remain in their original positions and maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to one another?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B to Image A, it's evident that all major architectural features—such as windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—are retained in their original positions. The LEGO transformation respects this layout, ensuring that these elements remain aligned and spaced as intended. The transformation into LEGO form has not disrupted the spatial relationship and alignment established in the original image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders between the LEGO building and the sky, trees, or parked cars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, the transition between the LEGO building and its surrounding elements, such as the sky, trees, and vehicles, appears smooth without visible seams or color bleeding. Additionally, edges are clean, and no sharp discontinuities are present. The integration of the LEGO motif maintains a seamless visual boundary, indicating a high-quality rendering without any artifacts.",
