      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the mechanical sentinels replacing the buses have intact geometric shapes, smooth surfaces, and consistent glowing blue underlights without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical sentinels are standing on the bridge. They exhibit angular, robotic designs, which are highlighted by vibrant blue underlights. The mechanical shapes appear smooth and well-defined, indicating meticulous design. The underlighting is evenly distributed across the robots, which suggests a consistent design. There are no visible rendering artifacts like jagged edges or missed textures, which indicates a high-quality rendering process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the golden automaton version of Big Ben have uniform metallic texture, proper vertical alignment, and a centrally placed cosmic eye clockface without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed Big Ben into a golden automaton features a consistently metallic texture that reflects light with a smooth, polished finish. The vertical alignment of the structure remains correct without signs of tilt or misalignment. The dominant feature, a cosmic eye replacing the traditional clock face, is centrally placed and radiates symmetrically, free from any distortions that could disrupt its harmonized appearance with the rest of the automaton.",

      "question": "Are the energetic vines wrapped around the Houses of Parliament following plausible growth patterns, maintaining consistent glow, and not intersecting through solid architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines that are interwoven around the Houses of Parliament exhibit a surreal glowing quality, suggestive of a living energy. Their growth pattern seems organic as they spiral upward and adhere to the contours of the building's architecture without any signs of unrealistic penetration through solid structures. The glow radiates consistently along the entire length of the vines, aiding in maintaining a coherent ethereal aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the airships in the sky properly scaled, positioned at a reasonable altitude, and displaying iridescent surfaces without harsh edges or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows airships floating in the sky above the Houses of Parliament. These airships are scaled in relation to the buildings below, maintaining a believable size variance that suggests a reasonable altitude. Their surfaces exhibit a mesmerizing iridescence, smoothly transitioning colors without harsh edges, and their placement does not create mismatched shadows, which implies careful attention to lighting consistency.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) blend with the ambient lighting of the scene without creating overly bright spots or unnatural contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, glowing elements – the underlights of the sentinels, the cosmic eye on Big Ben, the luminous vines, and the iridescent surfaces of the airships – harmonize with the ambient lighting derived from the setting sun. These elements emit light without generating overly bright spots that could overpower the natural lighting, maintaining an integrated contrast level. This suggests a balanced and realistic lighting setup.",
