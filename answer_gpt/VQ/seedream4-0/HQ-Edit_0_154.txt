    "Question": "Q1: Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wallet is represented by a schematic drawing. The visual cues indicate a clean and accurate depiction with straight lines and closed geometric shapes forming a rectangle, mimicking a real wallet. Such precise lines suggest the use of vector-based design, which typically yields sharp and accurate outlines without jagged edges or missing lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the wallet's lines in the schematic structure are consistently thin and continuous, characteristic of digital technical drawings. This precision indicates there are no smudges or variations in line thickness, making the schematic appear free of texture or artifact, typical of digital design work.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text annotations for the currencies (USD, QAR, INR) are aligned alongside or near the illustrations of the banknotes, ensuring they don't interfere with the actual depiction of the notes or the wallet’s design. This strategic placement maintains clarity and the visual layout's integrity, avoiding any overlap or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the exchange rate charts and country economy icons aligned horizontally or vertically in a balanced manner, with no floating or misplaced elements that disrupt visual flow?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a systematic arrangement of exchange rate charts and economy icons, which appear organized in a structured, grid-like manner, either horizontally or vertically aligned. There are no signs of floating or misplaced elements, indicating a thoughtful design that ensures balanced visual flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the visible banknotes (USD $20, QAR 10, INR 50) retain clear denominations, readable text, and intact designs without blurring, stretching, or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the banknotes display clearly marked denominations. The detail and text on each note are rendered in a style akin to technical or blueprint drawing without indication of blurring or distortion. This suggests their designs, though schematic, remain intact and recognizable without artifacts like pixelation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
