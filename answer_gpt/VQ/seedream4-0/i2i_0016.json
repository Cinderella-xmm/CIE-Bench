      "question": "Are the clothing and hairstyle features of the players accurately represented in chibi form without artificial or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version of the players shows simplified and exaggerated features common in chibi art, such as larger heads and smaller bodies. The clothing is consistent with athletic wear typically worn by tennis players, featuring sleeveless tops and skirts. The hairstyles of the characters also match the ponytail styles seen in tennis athletes. These elements are stylized but accurately represent the original features without artificial textures. The depiction uses smooth, clean lines characteristic of chibi drawings, which avoids any distortion.",

      "question": "Do the players' hands in the handshake pose appear natural and anatomically correct, with no missing or extra fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters' handshake is designed with simplified anatomy typical in this art style, showing the correct number of fingers. Although the fingers are represented using minimal detail due to the stylization, the pose looks natural for a handshake motion. The positioning of the hands relative to the arms and body follows the natural posture expected in a handshake.",

      "question": "Does the semi-transparent tennis court logo integrate smoothly into the background without creating distracting artifacts or distorting the tennis court?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the semi-transparent tennis court logo is a subtle overlay that merges well with the court's existing lines and colors. It doesn't introduce any visual artifacts or distortions to the image of the tennis court, indicating it is properly integrated. The transparency allows the court details to remain visible and clear, so it doesn't detract from the overall image.",

      "question": "Are the tennis rackets proportionally appropriate for the chibi characters and clearly identifiable as tennis rackets without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis rackets in Image B are depicted in a size that is proportionally fitting for the chibi characters. Even within the stylization, the rackets maintain their distinctive shape, with clear demarcations for the handle and the netted section. This format ensures they remain recognizable as tennis rackets without distorting their original design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details like facial expressions and clothing patterns on the chibi characters been preserved without significant loss or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters show simplified but expressive facial features typical of this artistic style, conveying emotions through large eyes and small mouths. The clothing patterns are minimally detailed, appropriate for chibi simplicity, but still retain identifiable elements such as trim lines. The representation avoids excessive smoothing and maintains clarity where needed to convey the scene.",
