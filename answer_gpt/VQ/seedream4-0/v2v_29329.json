      "question": "Do the proportions of the shirt and tie appear natural and appropriate for the baby's body size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt appears oversized for a baby, which is common for comedic or stylistic purposes. The tie is well situated on the shirt but also looks large, which visually emphasizes the contrast between adult clothing and a baby's small body size. When comparing with Image A, both images show the shirt and tie similarly oversized, reaffirming the depiction of an intentionally humorous outfit. This conclusion is based on the knowledge that adult-sized clothing on babies is often intended for humorous effect.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the shirt and tie smooth and consistent with typical fabric materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the shirt and tie appear smooth, with shadows and highlights that suggest typical woven fabric materials, such as cotton or a cotton blend, used in dress shirts and ties. There's no visible discrepancy in the fabric textures, which aligns with common manufacturing standards for these types of garments. The visual details, like the smoothness and sheen of the tie and the evenness of the shirt fabric, support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Do the baby's hands holding the glasses appear anatomically correct and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the babyâ€™s hands are visibly small and characteristic of baby anatomy, appearing natural as they grasp the glasses. The fingers are appropriately positioned and proportioned, allowing for a grip that looks plausible for a baby holding an object. Similar natural hand positioning is visible in Image A. The conclusion is based on typical baby hand anatomy and grip capabilities.",

      "question": "Does the baby's posture and the way the clothes drape over the body look natural and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baby's posture is seated upright against a cushion, a common and achievable position for a baby of that age with support. The drape of the oversized clothes follows gravity naturally, pooling slightly due to their size. Image A also shows a similar effect, suggesting the oversized clothes are real, not digitally manipulated around the body, and the posture is consistent with a young child supported in a seated position.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, edges, or inconsistencies where the clothing appears to be edited onto the baby?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions between the clothing and the baby's body are smooth, with no visible unnatural edges or editing artifacts. The lighting on the clothes and the baby is consistent, indicating that the clothing is naturally worn rather than added digitally. Image A similarly presents the attire without visible inconsistencies, reinforcing the impression that the clothing was genuinely worn by the baby during the photo capture.",
