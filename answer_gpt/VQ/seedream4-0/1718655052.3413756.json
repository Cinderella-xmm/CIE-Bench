    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the hat and scarf are designed to look like wood carvings. The realistic representation is achieved through the visual cues of grain patterns and engraved details on the LEGO pieces. These mimic the natural wood structure typically characterized by visible lines and a slightly rough texture, indicating a wood-like appearance without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a coherent assembly of LEGO bricks that forms a continuous layer over the dog's body. The pieces are well-aligned and fit together in a manner typical of LEGO construction, without visible gaps or inconsistencies. Such precise assembly avoids any scenarios of floating pieces and maintains an anatomical plausibility suitable for a LEGO model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the light-colored wooden tabletop serves as a neutral backdrop for the LEGO dog model. The lighting is even across the surface with no stark contrasts or transitions that would indicate a compositing error. This contributes to a seamless integration where the subject and background appear naturally unified.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ear flaps on the wood-carved hat in image B are symmetrically placed on either side of the dog's head. They are both shaped equally, maintaining proportionality and balance so as to reflect realistic positioning consistent with accurate LEGO assembly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the LEGO bricks covering the dog's body show uniform edge definition and consistent shading. Each brick is placed logically, maintaining the structural integrity expected from a well-constructed LEGO model. There are no undesirable blocky artifacts or disruptive color clumps, contributing to a smooth visual continuity.",
