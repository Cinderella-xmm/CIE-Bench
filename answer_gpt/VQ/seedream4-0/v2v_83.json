      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is depicted in a 3D cartoon style, but maintains an accurate representation of its distinct features, such as the colorful design, round wheels, and realistic hardware (trucks and bolts). Despite the transition into a cartoon format, the skateboard's essential elements are preserved, ensuring its credibility as a recognizable skateboarding object.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's clothing, including the hoodie and cap, is rendered in smooth and clean textures without noticeable artifacts. The design closely matches typical 3D cartoon aesthetics where surface details are simplified yet achieved without errors, supporting the natural appearance of the attire.",

      "question": "Do the skill stats and bars appear naturally integrated into the character card without disrupting the overall visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skill stats and bars are presented within a framed character card, following a consistent design style with visual elements like stars and numerical representations. They are integrated neatly, adding functional context to the character card without detracting from the visual harmony or introducing clutter.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skater's pose and body proportions depicted naturally and without distortion in the 3D cartoon aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the skater in a natural standing pose typical in 3D cartoon renderings, with proportions consistent with exaggerated cartoon styles—such as slightly larger head and narrower body—without causing distortion. The pose is believable, capturing a relaxed stance while holding a skateboard.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the urban scenery and clear sky work harmoniously with the foreground subjects—the skater and the skateboard—to create a credible setting. The background is proportionate, with distant elements like buildings and trees that fit seamlessly into the scene and do not introduce structural anomalies or disruptions.",
