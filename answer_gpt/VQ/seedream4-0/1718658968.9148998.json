      "question": "Are the wooden puzzle pieces covering the castle's exterior uniformly textured with natural oak and mahogany variations, showing no repeating patterns or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a castle made of wooden puzzle pieces with the appearance of natural oak and mahogany. The texture across the castleâ€™s exterior varies uniformly, displaying seamless integration of different wood tones without any noticeable repeating patterns or seams. This demonstrates a realistic and artisanal approach to woodwork design, utilizing common woodworking techniques where wood variations are naturally blended.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the towers, archway, and surrounding walls retain their original shape and proportions without any geometric distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden puzzle replicates the exact shape and proportions of the castle's design seen in Image A. The towers are symmetrical and aligned properly with the walls and archway mirrored perfectly without geometric distortion. Such precision is typical in well-crafted wooden model constructions where parts are designed to fit precisely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top edges of both towers composed of clearly interlocked wooden puzzle pieces with no gaps, floating fragments, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top edges of the towers in Image B show a neat interlocking design of the wooden puzzle pieces, with all segments fitting tightly together without gaps or floating fragments. This reflects the craftsmanship detail often found in wooden puzzle designs where each piece is meticulously crafted to interconnect tightly.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle resting on a smooth, continuous wooden surface that matches the wood type and finish of the puzzle pieces, with consistent lighting and shadow under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is a smooth wooden surface well-matched with the type and finish of the puzzle pieces used in the castle. The lighting and shadows are consistent, highlighting the continuity in the wood texture and finish integration between the castle pieces and its base. This continuity in material and light interaction adheres to standard practices in creating cohesive wooden displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections in the water and shadows beneath the castle show accurate interaction with the wooden surface, with no unnatural glare, color shifts, or floating reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents reflections and shadows that accurately interact with the wooden surface below the castle. The reflection in the water shows consistent alignment with the castle without unnatural glare or color shifts, maintaining optical physics principles that govern reflections and shadows in real scenarios.",
