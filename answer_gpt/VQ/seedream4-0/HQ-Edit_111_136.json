      "question": "Does the white chiton with gold accents on the woman’s body show natural fabric folds and lighting consistency, without visible pixelation, texture repetition, or unnatural stiffness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white chiton with gold accents is rendered with intricate detailing that reflects a realistic portrayal of fabric. The folds and drapery of the chiton appear to follow natural gravitational laws, reflecting realistic lighting consistent with the rest of the image. There aren't any visible signs of pixelation or texture repetition, which often indicates a well-rendered digital illustration. The chiton also shows smooth transitions in the fabric's presentation without appearing stiff or unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the classical Greek-style waves and laurel leaves in the woman's hair consistent in shape, density, and lighting with the surrounding environment, and do they avoid unnatural clumping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves and laurel leaves in the woman's hair in Image B appear finely detailed and harmonize with the classical Greek theme of the image. The shape and density of these elements are consistent with the surrounding environment and are intelligently integrated into the composition without appearing to clump or float awkwardly. The lighting on these details appears consistent with that on the rest of the figure, further indicating a coherent and deliberate design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the trees and animals in the background retain recognizable forms while being rendered in a golden, stylized manner consistent with classical Greek pottery art, without distorted proportions or fragmented geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features stylized trees and animals that align with the aesthetics of classical Greek pottery art. These elements are characterized by their simplified yet recognizable forms, maintaining classical balance and symmetry without distortion or geometric fragmentation. The golden tone adds to the stylized, artistic effect, consistent with the overarching theme and design of the image.",

      "question": "Is the sky rendered with coherent cloud formations and directional lighting that matches the overall illumination of the scene, avoiding artificial seams or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is illustrated with cloud formations that seamlessly blend into the scene, maintaining coherent shading and directional lighting that matches the overall illumination throughout the image. There are no visible artificial seams, breaks, or sudden inconsistencies in shading, suggesting that the sky was rendered with attention to maintaining a harmonious composition with the rest of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the woman’s hands and feet anatomically correct, with five fingers per hand and natural joint positioning, and does her posture reflect plausible human motion without deformation or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's hands and feet in Image B are rendered with anatomical accuracy, featuring five fingers on each hand and joints positioned naturally. Her posture is dynamic yet plausible, capturing a sense of motion and grace without any evident deformation or unnatural stretching. This attention to detail contributes to the overall fluid and realistic depiction of human movement in the image.",
