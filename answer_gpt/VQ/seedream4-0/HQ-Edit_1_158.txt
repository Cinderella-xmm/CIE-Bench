    "Question": "Q1: Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the silhouette of the woman, created using layered paper cut-outs, appears anatomically proportional. Each limb and part of the body maintains realistic proportions, and there are no visible geometric distortions like misalignment or unnatural bends. The transition of layers seems smoothly aligned and comprehensible, displaying a cohesive silhouette representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the womanâ€™s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is designed as a paper cut-out and its size is proportionate to the paper-cut hands and arms of the figure. It is depicted as resting naturally in her hands and positioned coherently with the arms, without appearing to float or intersect awkwardly with the chair or body segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lace details are represented through intricate paper cut-outs that effectively simulate the appearance of a lace texture. These paper details are delicately placed to mimic the sweater's texture, displaying coherence and continuity, with no unnatural edges or evident pattern repetition that breaks the visual consistency of the outfit.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the simplified bookshelves maintain coherent shelf structure with aligned edges and realistic spacing between books, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelf, rendered in layered paper art, maintains a structural coherence where the edges of the shelves are well-aligned, and the spacing between each book follows a consistent arrangement. There are no obvious floating or misaligned elements disrupting the shelf organization.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the antique-gold cardstock background uniformly textured and lit, with no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches that separate it from the central figure and other elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background uses an antique-gold cardstock paper that demonstrates a consistent texture and lighting. The golden hue transitions smoothly without visible abrupt edges or lighting mismatches, cohesively blending with the central paper-cut figure and other elements in the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
