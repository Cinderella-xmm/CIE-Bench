      "question": "Do the enlarged and shiny mango pieces retain their natural texture and shape without appearing distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, we notice that the mango pieces have a highly stylized, shiny, and smooth appearance, deviating from the natural texture we expect from a real mango. These pieces have a reflective surface and well-defined, sharp cube shapes, which are not typical for natural mango slices. The reflection and glossiness give them an unnatural, artificial look, suggesting they are more like an artistic rendering rather than a realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Does the cartoon-like design of the lime and chili powder bowl appear visually credible and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime and chili powder bowl have been given a cartoon-like treatment. The lime shows a stylized face with a wink, and the bowl has a cheerful expression, consistent with a cartoon aesthetic. This design direction is intentional within a cartoon or whimsical context. There are no visual artifacts or distortions that disrupt this intended style, making them credible within the chosen design theme.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the edited elements, including the whimsical mango figurine, lime, and chili powder bowl, visually credible and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B features a well-balanced arrangement of elements. The whimsical mango figurine, lime, and chili powder bowl are artistically placed in a manner that portrays unity and an intended cartoon style. The composition maintains structural consistency with evenly distributed elements, enhancing the playful and cohesive visual appeal without any awkward positioning of elements.",

      "question": "Does the shiny 3D effect on the mango pieces enhance the visual appeal without degrading fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shiny 3D effect on the mango pieces in Image B does significantly alter their appearance by giving them a highly polished and reflective surface. This treatment removes the natural texture details, replacing them with a uniform gloss. While this might enhance the stylized, digital art appeal, it does so at the cost of the fine details one would expect in natural fruit, suggesting an unnatural texture.",

      "question": "Does the whimsical mango figurine retain its structural integrity and natural appearance, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whimsical mango figurine is designed to be consistent with an artistic, cartoonish aesthetic, featuring glossy, cube-like segments. While this deviates from a natural appearance, structurally, the figurine maintains its integrity without broken or distorted shapes. The alteration appears deliberate to fit the whimsical theme without morphological errors.",
