    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the woman and child are enlarged which is a typical feature in cartoon or anime renderings to emphasize expressiveness. The eyes are centered on the face and appear to maintain a natural spacing and alignment relative to other facial features. Without reference to Image A but based on common cartoon design, the enlarged eyes blend well, suggesting they're part of the character design style rather than a distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hands of the woman and child show five fingers each, with natural finger curvature and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the woman and child with hands clearly visible, showing five fingers each. The fingers are drawn with typical cartoon-style curvature, appearing naturally posed and without overlap or missed depiction of digits. This aligns with stylized cartoons emphasizing simplicity yet completeness in representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses watercolor-style textures, which inherently incorporate smooth and soft transitions reminiscent of natural media painting. Such techniques prevent sharp digital edges and create smooth transitions in colors across elements such as fabric and florals, suggesting a handcrafted touch rather than digital blotchiness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, floral accents appear added in a manner consistent with the overall watercolor aesthetic, matching the style and size relative to other elements. Lighting and texture are consistent with an artistic rendition, but the watercolor texture may not realistically portray shadows, which are often simplified or stylized. Yet, this matches the natural artistic continuity in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the wooden border have uniform thickness, natural wood grain, and proper alignment with the image edges without gaps or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden border in Image B is visibly consistent in thickness and shows an even, stylized wood grain pattern. It aligns properly with the image edges, maintaining uniformity and symmetry throughout its frame, indicative of meticulous design often desirable in illustrative works.",
