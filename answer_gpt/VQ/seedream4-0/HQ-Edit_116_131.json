      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the qipao clearly defined with consistent outlines and no broken or distorted petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns are part of an illustration style, which often features clear and defined outlines typical in artworks. When observing these patterns, they appear to be well-structured with consistent outlines without breaks or distortions, which is characteristic of a carefully rendered illustration where clarity is prioritized. Thus, the floral patterns maintain their form without irregularities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jade-patterned clasps align correctly along the central seam and display consistent shape and size without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the illustration of Image B, the jade-patterned clasps appear to be symmetrically aligned along the central seam, maintaining consistency in shape and size. This alignment is typical for well-drawn illustrations, where elements are deliberately placed to achieve visual harmony and avoid any deformation that might occur in more freeform styles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the color distribution across the qipao uniform, with no visible banding or abrupt transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the qipao's color appears uniformly distributed, as illustrations often employ smooth gradients and consistent colors to portray fabrics realistically. There are no visible banding or abrupt transitions between hues within the constraints of the illustration style, indicating careful attention to maintaining color uniformity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable writing sections placed with clean edges and consistent lighting, and do they appear anchored to the garment rather than floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detachable writing sections are illustrated with clean edges, typical of cartoon or illustration styles. They appear to be well-integrated and anchored to the qipao due to the shading and positioning, which is strategic in illustration to convey attachment and consistency in lighting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand show five fingers with normal spacing, natural curvature, and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B is depicted with five fingers that have normal spacing and natural curvature, as per usual anatomical accuracy observed in quality illustrations. The focus on proportions and accurate anatomy ensures that no extra or missing digits are present, maintaining realism within the context of the illustration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all elements of the qipao and added components proportionally balanced and spatially coherent without stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustration in Image B presents all elements of the qipao and added components with proportional balance and spatial coherence. Within the realm of detailed illustration, achieving such balance is crucial, thereby avoiding any stretching or compression that would detract from visual appeal and realism.",
