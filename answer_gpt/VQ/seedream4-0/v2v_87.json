      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts visible on the elephant figure within the transparent glass cube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant figure is constructed from small, interlocking plastic bricks, typical of construction toys like LEGO. The texture of the elephant is therefore composed of flat, smooth surfaces with visible seams that are characteristic of these toys. These are not 'unnatural' in the context of a toy model and there are no visible digital artifacts in Image B that would suggest unnatural textures beyond the expected appearance of LEGO bricks. Therefore, no unnatural textures or visual artifacts are evident.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the elephant and minifigure appear consistent and undistorted within the transparent glass cube?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant and the minifigure are both constructed from interlocking plastic bricks. The minifigure's proportions are typical of a LEGO minifigure, characterized by a large head, short limbs, and a simplistic shape. The elephant is also proportionate to realistic animals albeit simplified heavily due to the brick construction. Both figures appear within a glass cube in a manner consistent with each other, maintaining proportion and rational scaling typical of such toy representations.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the elephant's skin texture and the backpack's material been preserved without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant and the backpack are represented as built with LEGO bricks, which inherently do not capture fine details like skin texture or material of fabric accurately due to the blocks' limitations. The LEGO design prioritizes blocky, abstracted forms over minute details, hence no fine details like skin or fabric textures are present to be preserved or distorted; the visual appearance is correct for the medium used.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the color palette of the elephant and the rich red tone of the backpack blend naturally with the desert-inspired interior without any jarring contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette of the LEGO elephant and the figure is a selection of browns, reds, and whites typically used in toy bricks, set against a desert-like background. While these colors are vibrant, which is natural for plastic toys, they are not necessarily intended to mimic the subtleties of natural environments but don't create jarring contrasts in this toy context. The pieces are effectively integrated visually within the cube setting due to consistent LEGO styling.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the elements within the transparent glass cube, including the elephant, minifigure, and engraved nameplate, visually credible and well-balanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a neatly arranged display inside a glass cube with the LEGO elephant, minifigure, and an engraved nameplate. The elephant is centrally positioned, suggesting its importance and the minifigure and nameplate both adding context. This layout is typical of a display case where the main subject is prominently featured and supported by additional elements that enhance the visual balance and credibility, making the setup appear thoughtfully composed.",
