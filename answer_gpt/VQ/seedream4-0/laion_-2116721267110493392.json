      "question": "Do the cartoon versions of the two boys have proportionally correct head shapes and facial features that align with typical human anatomy, without exaggerated or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon versions of the boys depict head shapes and facial features. Analyzing these, the head shapes are round and the facial features are proportionate, which align with typical human anatomy. Although simplified, these features do not show exaggerated or distorted geometry, like oversized heads or irregular facial proportions. For cartoons, maintaining a balance between stylization and anatomy is common, which Image B successfully does, reflecting natural anatomy and proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements rendered with consistent material textures and lighting that match the surrounding environment, avoiding glossy or flat-painted artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements. The textures appear consistent, with a smooth, matte finish that fits well within the cartoon-style classroom. The lighting, though simplified, appears uniformly applied across objects, avoiding unrealistic glossiness or overly flat textures often found in stylized cartoons. The colors are vibrant and consistent, contributing to the cohesive visual environment.",

      "question": "Are the floating books and animated tablet screen positioned in a way that respects spatial depth and casting appropriate shadows, ensuring they appear physically plausible within the classroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floating books and animated tablet screen respect spatial rules typical of cartoons, where depth and shadow are suggested rather than accurately depicted. Despite simplification, their placement is plausible, with the objects positioned to suggest depth without irregular or awkward perspective distortion. Shadows in vector illustrations are often implied; hence, the positioning maintains physical plausibility within its stylized setting.",

      "question": "Are the robots and gadgets placed at appropriate scales and distances from the children, with smooth surfaces and no visible digital artifacts like aliasing or missing textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robots and gadgets in Image B are scaled appropriately to complement the size of the children without overwhelming the scene. Their surfaces are smooth, which is typical in vector-based illustrations. There are no signs of digital artifacts like aliasing or missing textures, ensuring these elements integrate seamlessly into the overall design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text clearly readable, positioned at the top without overlapping critical elements, and styled with clean lines and uniform thickness that match the playful aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'A Classroom Adventure' is positioned at the top of the illustration. This positioning ensures that it does not overlap with other elements, maintaining clarity. The text style features clean lines and a uniform thickness, consistent with the playful, cartoon aesthetic of the image. The font choice and color contrast enhance readability while being visually cohesive with the image's theme.",
