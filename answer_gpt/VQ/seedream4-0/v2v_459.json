      "question": "Do the vibrant striped and polka dot patterns on the 3D chibi-style ties appear undistorted and maintain their original integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties feature distinct vibrant patterns: one with diagonal stripes and the other with polka dots. The patterns appear clear, intact, and well-defined, with no visible signs of distortion. This preservation of pattern details aligns with common knowledge of maintaining design integrity for visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style ties seamlessly integrated into the realistic drawer setting without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are placed within a drawer setting that appears realistic with well-rendered textures. The ties, although chibi-style, blend into this environment without visible artifacts or mismatched textures, suggesting a careful integration that does not clash visually with the surrounding drawer elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties retain proper proportions and physical rationality, ensuring no geometric shapes are broken or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ties in Image B maintain their geometric form, with consistent edge lines and shapes that are typical for ties. Despite being rendered in a chibi-style, their proportions relative to each other and the drawer setting appear rational, supporting a coherent visual representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties exhibit consistent material properties, such as texture and sheen, similar to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the ties with a smooth texture and sheen that suggests a synthetic, possibly plastic material consistent with 3D characters. While this differs from typical fabric textures, it aligns with world knowledge of chibi representations where exaggerated and smooth textures are common.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the 3D chibi-style ties within the drawer setting adhere to common sense and physical logic, ensuring visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are placed neatly side by side inside a drawer, which is a logical and common way to organize such items. This orderly arrangement respects spatial proportions and common practices, aligning with expectations for organized storage.",
