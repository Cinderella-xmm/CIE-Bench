    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish is smoothly curved and has a consistent translucent appearance. The smoothness is maintained without seams or texture patches, highlighting an organic form typical of a jellyfish. The absence of any abrupt transitions or inconsistencies supports this conclusion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows that the tendrils are long, fluid, and appear smooth with an iridescent shimmer, consistent with natural jellyfish tendrils. There are no angular distortions or segmented appearances, which would be atypical for such organisms. This suggests they are depicted accurately.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell are swirly and evenly distributed, resembling natural bioluminescent designs. The absence of repetitive geometric shapes or jagged edges highlights a smooth, flowing pattern typical of natural light emittance in jellyfish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nodules on the tendrils in Image B exhibit a soft glow with a gradual light spread, avoiding harsh illumination. They are randomly dispersed along the tendrils in a non-uniform manner, resembling plausible natural occurrences without symmetrical repetition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the ambient lighting as diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, which are typical of underwater environments. Additionally, the presence of faint water particles and depth cues around the jellyfish further suggests a subaquatic setting, confirming the scene's consistency with an underwater atmosphere.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there should not be a connection point between the jellyfish and any ceiling, as it is depicted in an underwater environment. Therefore, the question about the connection point is inapplicable here, and it's clear that there is no ceiling or break in structure visible in the context of this scene.",
