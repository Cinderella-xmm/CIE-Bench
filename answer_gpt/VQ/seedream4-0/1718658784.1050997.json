      "question": "Does the cake’s icing display bold, graphic patterns that are evenly distributed and free from distorted textures or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake's icing is represented in a pop art style, which generally features bold, clear patterns and lines. The visual design consists of tidy, bold dots and lines that create an evenly distributed texture, typical of the graphic novel or pop art approach. There are no apparent distortions or fragmented lines, suggesting a stylized graphic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloons represented as uniform monochrome dots that maintain their original spherical form and clustered grouping without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are depicted with a pop art style, characterized by the use of dot patterns to fill the spherical shapes. Each balloon's form remains intact in a cluster, with the uniform dot pattern distributed evenly across the surfaces. There's no distortion or warping of the balloons' spherical shape, and they appear correctly clustered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the table and vase been converted into solid, contrasting color blocks with sharp, clean edges and no residual textures or blending artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and vase undergo a transformation typical of pop art, where objects are often depicted as bold color blocks with precise edges. The table and vase avoid residual textures or blending, appearing as solid colors with clear outlines, maintaining stylistic harmony with the rest of the composition.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the candle flame feature exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues while remaining attached to the wick and showing an upward directional flow without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the candle flame is styled in a manner consistent with pop art, emphasizing sharp, defined lines and vivid colors. The flame is accurately aligned with the candle's wick, with its angular shape suggesting upward movement, typical of a cartoonish or exaggerated rendering. There's no evidence of floating or detachment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements positioned consistently within the scene’s depth and perspective, with no floating or misplaced components relative to the table and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition preserves spatial consistency. The elements such as the cake, balloons, and vase are aligned appropriately to match the scene's perspective. Each component, like the cake on the table and the balloons hovering above, adheres to a coherent depth, with no misleading placement or floating inconsistencies.",
