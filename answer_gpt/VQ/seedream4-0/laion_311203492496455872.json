      "question": "Does the transformed hairstyle retain a consistent volumetric structure without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the cotton candy swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hairstyle mimics cotton candy or curlicue swirls. By analyzing the shape, we see the spirals smoothly twisting with uniform thickness and no jagged edges, indicating a seamless volumetric design. This is consistent with candy-like textures meant to convey a soft, coherent shape.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the suit with a glossy finish. This gloss is uniformly distributed, enhancing the 3D paper doll impression without disrupting the visual flow via inconsistent reflections or saturations. The paper-like texture is intentionally smooth to maintain character aesthetics.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful oversized tie is visually centered under the collar. It maintains proportionality, aligning well without distorting the neck or collar. This reflects deliberate styling to add whimsical character without structural disruptions.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
