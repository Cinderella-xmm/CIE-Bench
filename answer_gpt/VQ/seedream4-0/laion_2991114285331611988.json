    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the watch communicator on the plaid tie positioned naturally within the fabric, with consistent color, texture, and lighting that match the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B suggest that the watch communicator seems out of place on the plaid tie due to mismatched textures and lighting. The watch stands out prominently against the fabric's natural pattern, indicating it might have been digitally added, disrupting its consistency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camera lens embedded in the emblem on the right suit’s lapel aligned with the pattern and fabric, showing no gaps, misaligned edges, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the camera lens embedded in the emblem disrupts the natural alignment of the suit's fabric and pattern. The lens appears artificially added, with edges and highlights suggesting inconsistency with the original material.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles and dialogue text clearly separated from the characters’ faces and clothing, with clean lines and no overlap or distortion of nearby features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubbles and text are clearly separated from the characters, placed above the imagery. The lines remain clean, without any distortion or overlap affecting the character's features or clothing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the characters’ necks and shoulders retain natural proportions and smooth contours, without stretched, compressed, or fragmented shapes after anthropomorphization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's necks and shoulders exhibit unusual proportions, and the contours seem stretched and fragmented. This suggests digital alteration to blend human features with cartoonish elements, leading to unnatural depictions post-edit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B retains natural colors and detail without apparent distortion or noise. The grassy field and sky appear consistent with realistic photographic elements, implying no evident digital manipulation.",
