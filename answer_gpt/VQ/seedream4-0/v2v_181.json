      "question": "Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style models of the sheep and clock are displayed inside a snow globe. The sheep has smooth, rounded features typical of chibi-style rendering, characterized by a simplistic and cute approach. The clock has a glossy, consistent texture appropriate for a small decorative object. Both the sheep and clock maintain their fine details such as the sheep's facial expression and the clock's numerals and hands. No unnatural textures are evident in the image, indicating an attention to maintaining modeled detail and aesthetic quality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sheep appear naturally leaning against the clock without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi sheep is shown sitting next to the clock, appearing naturally in contact with it. The sheep's positioning seems relaxed and in harmony with the clock's position, typical for playful design where both elements are meant to interact as part of a single vignette within a snow globe. There aren't visible signs of distortion or awkward placement, which implies a composition designed with attention to maintaining natural interaction despite the stylized chibi design.",

      "question": "Do the gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe add to the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B contains small, gentle snowflakes that appear to be suspended within the scene. These snowflakes are semi-transparent and delicately placed, adding a sense of whimsy and elegance typical of snow globe scenes. There are no visible artifacts like pixelation or distortion around them, indicating they have been well integrated into the scene, effectively complementing it and enhancing its visual charm.",

      "question": "Does the wooden tabletop and warm, neutral-toned background create a visually harmonious and cozy atmosphere without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B sets the snow globe on a wooden tabletop with a warm tone, complemented by a soft-focus neutral background. This choice of elements contributes to a visually harmonious and cozy atmosphere, invoking a sense of warmth typical of a homey or serene setting. The lighting captures reflections and soft shadows, enhancing the warmth and complementing the other design elements without any evident inconsistencies or clashing tones.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop consistent and logical?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the snow globe, sheep, and clock are balanced to fit within this contained space. The snow globe's size relative to the sheep and clock is consistent, as is the setup on the tabletop, which supports the globe properly. The sheep and clock appear appropriately scaled for their position within the globe, and the globe fits naturally on the tabletop, maintaining coherent physical relationships and logical proportions throughout.",
