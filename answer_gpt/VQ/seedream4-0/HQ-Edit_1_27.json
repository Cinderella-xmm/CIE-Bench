      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower’s structure preserved with accurate proportions and no geometric distortions despite being scaled down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is shown within the glass dome and appears to maintain the same iconic shape and structure, albeit on a smaller scale. The proportions seem accurate, as the characteristics of the Eiffel Tower are distinct even when miniaturized. Without evident geometric distortions or irregularities, it visually retains the same proportionate structure as expected from the real tower.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, seamless glass dome structure above the scene that fully encloses it without intersecting or distorting any elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears transparent and encloses the scene entirely, showing no signs of intersection or distortion of the elements inside. The dome is smooth and without visual interruptions, covering the entire miniaturized landscape while preserving the integrity of each element within, supporting the conclusion that it doesn’t cause any intersecting or distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snow cover on the ground, trees, and lampposts appear uniformly powdery and free of clumping or artificial texture patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow is spread over the ground, trees, and lampposts with a consistent and natural powdery texture. There are no visible clumps or artificial patterns that indicate an unnatural texture. The snow looks finely distributed, complementing the miniature scenery within the glass dome, enhancing its realistic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all human figures proportionally small, anatomically correct (including hands with no more than five fingers), and posed in natural stances without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the edited image (Image B), the human figures are miniature and maintain a natural anatomy appropriate for their scale, with no apparent deformations. They appear proportionally correct, and their stances look natural, showing no signs of having more than five fingers or other anatomical inaccuracies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the streetlamps emit a faint, diffused glow without bright halos or overexposed areas, and are they aligned along the pathway as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlamps emit a subtle, diffused light that does not result in overexposure or a pronounced halo effect. The alignment of these lamps follows the pathways as seen in Image A, maintaining a consistent layout, which suggests careful attention to detail in this aspect of the editing process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are cobblestone textures visibly embedded beneath the snow along the pathways, showing consistent patterns and fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cobblestone paths in Image B are subtly visible beneath the snow, showing consistent textural details. The pathways exhibit fine detail, suggesting that the cobblestone textures are properly embedded beneath the snow cover, reinforcing a realistic miniature winter scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tree branches thin, naturally branched, and lightly dusted with snow without sagging or unnatural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branches appear thin and naturally branched, with a graceful dusting of snow. The snow appears to be lightly and evenly distributed without causing any sagging, and the accumulation is not unnatural, which maintains the aesthetic integrity of the scene within the dome.",
