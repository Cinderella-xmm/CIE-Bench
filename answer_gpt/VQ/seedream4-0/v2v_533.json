      "question": "Are the guitar and microphone depicted in a chibi-style 3D design while maintaining their original shapes and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar and microphone are rendered in a stylized, toy-like chibi appearance which simplifies features and exaggerates proportions typical of chibi designs. The guitar maintains its classic shape but exhibits simplified textures and brighter colors compared to the realistic depiction in Image A. The microphone exhibits similar traits, holding true to basic proportions and design but with a cartoonish simplicity. This simplification is characteristic of chibi designs, which often retain recognizable forms while being visually distinct from realistic renditions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays rose petals on the floor that match the lighting and ambient conditions set by the warm, gentle light. The petals have shadows and highlights that align with the direction and intensity of the light source present, contributing to their credibility within the scene. The position and dispersion appear natural, enhancing the visual authenticity.",

      "question": "Do the guitar and microphone retain their structural consistency and visual credibility despite being transformed into chibi-style 3D designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a transformation of the guitar and microphone into chibi-style designs, yet they maintain structural integrity and are instantly recognizable. Their visual credibility as musical instruments is preserved, albeit in a stylized form that simplifies but does not distort essential features, ensuring they fit the chibi style while remaining functionally plausible.",
