      "question": "Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is overlaid onto the background. Assessing the integration of text into the image, there are no visible signs of unnatural textures or disruptive artifacts around the apples or the text which suggests that the overlay process was smooth and well-done.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fonts for \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fonts used for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are simple and clear, matching the casual and natural ambiance of the scene with apples on a wooden surface in soft daylight. This choice appears intentional to avoid clashing with the image’s aesthetic, creating an overall pleasing and consistent appearance.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text placement does not interfere with the actual shapes of the apples. It is positioned in areas of the image where it doesn't overlap onto the apples or alter their contours, thus maintaining their original shapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the alignment of the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is strategically placed in complementary corners of the image: one at the bottom left and the other at the top right. This arrangement provides a balanced framing without encroaching on the main subject - the apples - thereby preserving visual harmony.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the apples, including their speckles and light reflections, remained clear and undamaged after adding the text “Fresh” and “Sweet”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In scrutinizing Image B, the text addition does not seem to impact the detailed quality of the apples themselves. The speckles, natural coloration, and light reflections on the apples are visibly intact and clear, indicating these features were not compromised by text overlay.",
