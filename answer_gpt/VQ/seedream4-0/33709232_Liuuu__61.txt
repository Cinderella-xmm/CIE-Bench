    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",
    "explanation": "The transformed building in Image B appears as a large robotic structure atop a traditional building. To assess geometric proportions, one must observe the symmetry, alignment, and uniformity of the robot's body parts such as the torso, arms, and head. The armored body should exhibit smooth transitions between surfaces, with straight lines and precise curves. There are no visible distortions, broken edges, or warping in the robotic components, indicating consistent geometric proportions and surface transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder pads of the robot are positioned over the roofline of the building. Seamless integration requires the edges to be sharp and the patterns to be coherent and aligned with the surrounding structures. Upon observing the shoulder pads, they appear to maintain clean and sharp edges without any distortion or fragmentation, meaning the integration is coherent with the roofline.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "Image B features modified traffic signs with holographic elements. Holograms typically exhibit a soft glow and transparency, potentially altering light and color in adjacent areas. The signs in Image B showcase holographic effects with a faint glow, yet the colors remain consistent without any unnatural shifts or light leaks affecting nearby areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",
    "explanation": "Robotic pedestrians in Image B are visible with limbs and joints. For correct proportions, each limb should maintain a consistent size relative to body parts, and each hand should have five functional fingers. Observing the pedestrians, they possess proportionate limb lengths, five fingers per hand, and joints aligned with human movement standards, indicating no unnatural segments or bending.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "Shadows should align with the sunlight direction, cast in harmony with surrounding objects, enhancing realism. The shadows in Image B, cast by robotic pedestrians and the transformed building, are in sync with sunlight source assumptions from the top-left. Observing their placements, they follow natural alignment and direction, ensuring consistency with environmental cues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
