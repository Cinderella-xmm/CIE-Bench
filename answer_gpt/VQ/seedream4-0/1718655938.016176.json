    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls clearly defined and geometrically consistent, without broken or warped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's architectural elements, including the steeple, roof, and walls, have clear outlines. The geometrical structure appears consistent with precise edges, reflecting an intentional design. The design is cartoon-like but maintains consistent geometry, free from distortions or irregularities. This observation aligns with the structured nature of architectural drawings.",

      "question": "Do the stained-glass windows display clear, coherent patterns with smooth color transitions and no pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stained-glass windows in Image B exhibit well-defined patterns. The colors transition smoothly across the glass without abrupt changes, pixelation, or jagged edges, suggesting a deliberate artistic style. The design retains clarity and coherence typical of stained glass artwork, enhancing the visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the candy-like tree replacements composed of smooth, continuous shapes with consistent surface textures, and do they maintain plausible proportions relative to the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candy-like trees in Image B have smooth outlines, suggesting an intentional design choice. The surface texture appears consistent, with the candy theme clearly visible. Relative to the church, these trees are proportioned in a whimsical manner that complements the fantastical style, maintaining plausible proportions within the cartoon fantasy context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the patchwork quilt sky feature uniform stitching lines and consistent color blending between patches, with no visible seams or sharp discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky resembles a patchwork quilt with distinct and uniform stitching. The patches blend colors seamlessly, with transitions between them appearing smooth. There are no harsh seams or discontinuities, which reflects cohesive artistry typically found in textile patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the light sources from the church windows cast consistent, soft shadows on the surrounding grass and path, matching the direction and intensity of the internal glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a bright and fantastical setting, but it does not specifically illustrate shadow effects or external glow from the church windows. The cartoon-style does not depict realistic shadow casting, instead emphasizing vibrant color over directional lighting effects. Thus, consistency in shadows relating to internal glow is not evident.",
