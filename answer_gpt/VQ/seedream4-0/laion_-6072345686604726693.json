      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the metallic wing structures exhibit uniform reflective properties and smooth surface transitions without visible seams or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic wing structures are visually highlighted with intricate patterns and designs that suggest a harmonious balance of surface features. The wings show consistent reflective properties implying a polished metallic surface, with fluid transitions and no apparent seams or texture inconsistencies. This is inferred from the depicted shiny and smooth surface, often found on high-quality metal sculptures or modern metallic designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leg-like structures derived from the minarets proportionally consistent with the rest of the structure and do they show natural curvature and joint-like articulation without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leg-like structures in Image B appear to be fluid extensions that integrate seamlessly with the design ethos of the transformed building. They maintain proportional consistency relative to the central structure, suggesting thoughtful design choices. The curvature and joint-like articulation of these structures indicate a symmetrical and realistic representation, free from distortion or warping which would be apparent through visual assessment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central jewel reflect light and cosmic patterns in a way that matches the direction of sunlight and surrounding environment, without appearing to float or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central jewel in Image B exhibits reflections and cosmic patterns that seem to align harmoniously with the environmental lighting. Sunlight direction and shadow casting are believable, given its position and contextual illumination. It displays natural integration with its surroundings through consistent shadowing and reflective effects, suggesting a coherent design choice without suspension or shadow conflicts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing patterns confined to surface-level details, following architectural lines, and do they emit light that blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh glows or obscuring textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing patterns are artistically embedded within the surface details of the transformed structure, aligning with architectural curves and lines. This strategic placement allows for an emitting glow that merges well with the ambient lighting, thereby enhancing the aesthetics without overpowering it or causing light pollution that disrupts texture visibility.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the junctions between the original building and the transformed elements such as wings, legs, or jewel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of Image B shows that the transformation involving wings, legs, and the central jewel have been implemented without any noticeable seams or blurring at junctions. The continuity in color and texture between the building elements and the transformed features indicates a seamless integration without transitions appearing forced or misaligned.",
