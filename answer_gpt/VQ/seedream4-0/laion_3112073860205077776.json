      "question": "Are the illustrated blueberries and text labels seamlessly integrated into the pie surface without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated blueberries and text labels are added as overlays on the pie surface. These elements are meant to enhance the visual presentation of the pie and integrate information about the berries. When examining the image, the illustrations do not exhibit pixelation or jagged edges, which suggests they are well-integrated. Consistent shadows and clean edges support the seamless integration, making the additions appear natural on the pie surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the anthropomorphic version of the mug retain the original cylindrical shape and handle position without stretching, warping, or breaking the object's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug has been anthropomorphized by adding facial features and arms holding a sign. Despite these additions, the core cylindrical shape of the mug and the position of its handle remain consistent with the object's original form observed in Image A. The editing process did not distort these fundamental aspects, maintaining the mug's familiar structure without deformation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chart positioned clearly within the frame without overlapping or obscuring the pie slice, mug, or plate, and does it have clean lines and legible text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chart in Image B is placed at the bottom of the frame, distinct from the pie slice, mug, and plate. It does not overlap or obscure these objects. The chart displays clear lines with readable text, allowing viewers to understand the nutritional information provided without any visual clutter.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the warm pastel tones applied evenly across the scene without causing unnatural discoloration of the ceramic, glass, or baked pie surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Warm pastel tones in Image B provide a softer and aesthetically pleasing appearance across the scene. These tones are applied in a way that enhances the visual coherence without distorting the natural colors of the elements such as the ceramic surfaces, glass reflections, or the texture of the baked pie. This preserves the authenticity of the original materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pie slice, mug, plate, and table maintain their original geometric forms and spatial relationships without any visible warping, fragmentation, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial relationships and geometric forms of the pie slice, mug, plate, and table are preserved as seen in Image A. There is no evidence of warping, fragmentation, or misalignment in these elements, indicating that despite the additional illustrations and text, the overall structural integrity of the composition is maintained.",
