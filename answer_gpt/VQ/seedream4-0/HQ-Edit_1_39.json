    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the patterned scales on the cactus body consistent in texture and color with the embroidery of the sombrero, and do they follow the natural curvature of the cactus without visible seams or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observe the presence of a golden dragon-like creature with scaly skin beneath the sombrero. The sombrero is embellished with colorful embroidery typical of Mexican culture. The scales are gold and reflective, not matching the embroidery in texture or color. They do not form part of a cactus body nor follow the curvature, as the original cactus is entirely replaced. Since the scales and sombrero decorations are entirely dissimilar in texture and color, the answer is No.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the stone-like base beneath the cactus have a natural rock texture, proper grounding on the wooden surface, and proportional size relative to the cactus, without appearing detached or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, beneath the sombrero-wearing dragon, there is a stone base with sandy accents. This stone has a natural and rough texture typical of a desert rock. It fits well on the wooden surface, suggesting good grounding and proportionality with the dragon figure, allowing it to appear as part of the scene without looking unnaturally shaped or detached. Considering the elements, the answer is Yes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the golden quills emerge naturally from the cactus ridges in a uniform, radial pattern, maintaining the original spine density and orientation without clumping, floating, or intersecting improperly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a cactus with spines; instead, it features a dragon-like creature with uniform, radial patterns of scales. There are no signs of golden quills emerging from cactus ridges in Image B. Thus, the phenomenon of golden quills emerging from cactus ridges is not visible, leading to the answer No.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sandy aura smoothly integrated around the base of the cactus and stone feet, exhibiting soft gradients and particle flow consistent with wind dynamics, without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sandy aura flowing naturally around the stone base of the dragon figure, with gradients that merge smoothly into the environment. The flow of sand and its integration suggest dynamics consistent with wind patterns, lacking sharp boundaries or pixelation. Therefore, the sandy integration is consistent and well-rendered, resulting in the answer Yes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the topaz-colored eyes placed symmetrically and naturally on the upper portion of the cactus, with clear reflections and highlights that match the ambient lighting, without distorting surrounding spines or surface geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature has topaz-colored eyes, which are located near the top of its head with symmetrical placement. The eyes reflect ambient lighting suitably, adding realism to the depiction. There is no distortion of surrounding spines or surface geometry since the structure is that of a dragon rather than a cactus. With symmetry and natural placement confirmed for the dragon figure's eyes, the answer is Yes.",
