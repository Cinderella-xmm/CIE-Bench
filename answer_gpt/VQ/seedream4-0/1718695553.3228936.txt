    "Question": "Q1: Is the white studio background uniformly flat and free of shadows, texture mismatches, or visible edges where it meets the toy?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a plain white studio setup that is commonly used for product photography to highlight the product without distractions. This type of background should be smooth and even, without any visible shadows or texture inconsistencies that could detract from the product's presentation. The image appears to maintain this standard, showing no visible mismatches or edges where the background meets the toy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the logo tag on the hippo’s ear properly aligned with the knit texture, showing realistic thread stitching and no unnatural color or shape distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the logo tag on the hippo’s ear should seamlessly integrate with the knit texture of the toy. This means the tag should have realistic stitching visible that matches the texture of the fabric. Any color or shape distortion on the tag would make it look artificial. The image shows the tag as properly aligned and consistent with the fabric’s texture, maintaining the natural look of the plush toy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the circular patch on the hippo’s side have consistent knit texture and thickness with the surrounding fabric, without raised or detached appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the circular patch on the hippo’s side should blend smoothly with the rest of the toy's fabric. A consistent knit texture and thickness indicate that the patch is naturally part of the toy, rather than an artificial addition. The image suggests that the patch maintains the same texture and thickness, appearing to be an integrated part of the toy without any raised or detached areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the packaging box positioned behind the toy at a natural distance, with consistent lighting and shadow alignment that matches the direction of light on the toy?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates the positioning of the packaging box behind the toy. For the scene to appear natural, the box should be lit in a way that is consistent with the lighting on the toy, including shadows. The image appears to show the box with shadows and lighting that align with those on the toy, suggesting a cohesive setup where elements complement each other.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the plastic window on the box front transparent with subtle reflections and no distortion of the toy’s image visible through it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plastic window of the box is meant to showcase the toy inside clearly. A good design would include subtle reflections indicative of transparency but should avoid any distortion of the toy's image. The image indicates that the window maintains transparency, allowing the toy to be seen clearly without distortion, and has reflections that contribute to a realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
},

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the text elements clearly visible, correctly spaced, and rendered with smooth edges without jaggedness or overlapping with other objects?",
    "explanation": "The text on Image B should be legible and smoothly rendered, indicating high-quality printing. Each letter should be distinct with proper spacing and no jagged edges, all adhering to the background or object they are on. The text appears smoothly integrated with the packaging design, without overlapping other elements, maintaining professional presentation quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
