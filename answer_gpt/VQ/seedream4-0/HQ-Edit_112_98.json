      "question": "Do the petal-like feathers on the sparrow’s body exhibit smooth transitions in pink gradient without visible pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features pink petal-like feathers on the bird. The visual information suggests that the transitions between different shades of pink are smooth and gradual. The application of color does not exhibit pixelation, banding, or abrupt color shifts, which indicates a high-quality editing process where colors blend seamlessly. Based on world knowledge of graphics editing, such smooth color transitions can be achieved using gradient tools or brush techniques that ensure even application of colors.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blossom patterns on the wings aligned with the natural feather structure and do they avoid overlapping or warping of existing feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an edited bird with decorative blossom patterns applied to the wings. These blossoms are visually aligned with the feathers' natural structure, suggesting that they are placed thoughtfully to enhance rather than distort the wing shape. There is no evidence of overlapping or warping around the feather edges, indicating skillful integration into the bird's anatomy.",

      "question": "Does the cascading cherry blossom tail emerge naturally from the base of the original tail and follow a downward flow that matches the bird’s posture without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird's tail has been altered to include cascading cherry blossoms. These blossoms emerge from what visually appears to be the base of the edited tail. They follow a natural downward flow that aligns with the bird's posture, suggesting proper attachment and integration into the bird's silhouette without any signs of floating or misalignment.",

      "question": "Do the vines around the sparrow’s legs follow natural curvature and thickness proportional to the leg size, without penetrating or distorting the foot structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows vines wrapped around the bird's legs. The vines follow the natural curvature and length of the legs, proportional to their size, without appearing to penetrate or distort the foot structure. The visual cues suggest these vines have been added with correct scale and positioning.",

      "question": "Are the dewdrop ornaments on the chest positioned realistically on the surface of the feathers and do they reflect light consistently with surrounding lighting conditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features dewdrop ornaments on the bird's chest. These ornaments appear to be positioned realistically on the surface of the feathers, adhering to typical jewelry placement. They reflect light consistently with the lighting in the scene, as evident from the bright illumination of the scene and corresponding reflections in the dewdrops, matching world knowledge of light behavior and reflection.",
