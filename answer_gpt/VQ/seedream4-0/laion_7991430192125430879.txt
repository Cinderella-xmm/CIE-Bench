    "Question": "Q1: Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the LEGO brick construction of the bottle's body appears to maintain a consistent cylindrical form. The bricks are aligned in a way that they fit together tightly, forming a smooth surface without visible warping or misalignment. The use of similar sized LEGO pieces tends to provide structural consistency typical in LEGO constructions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are all brand text elements (e.g., 'BACARDÍ', 'MOJITO') and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brand text elements 'BACARDÍ' and 'MOJITO' are clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label. The lettering is intact and not distorted, suggesting close attention to detail was given during its construction. The LEGO art successfully replicates the design details visible in traditional packaging labels.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the blue LEGO cap is constructed in a cylindrical shape but featuring the angular details typical for LEGO tops, which naturally results in angular breaks rather than a smooth, rounded top. While LEGO designs inherently incorporate these angular shapes, the cap appears consistent in size as compared to the bottle’s neck.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the white shelf appears flat and horizontally aligned, devoid of irregular edges or floating segments. It integrates seamlessly with the scene, providing a stable and consistent platform for the LEGO bottle. There are no signs suggesting poor integration, as the shelf looks natural and properly placed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the smaller text elements such as 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, whilst the prominent text elements are clear, the smaller text elements are not completely visible or as detailed as they appear in Image A due to the limitations inherent in the LEGO brick construction. There is less definition in the small text replicating details like spacing and continuity, leading to potential inconsistencies in readability.",
    "answer": "No"
