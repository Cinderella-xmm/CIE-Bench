    "Question": "Q1: Does the front view of the apple maintain its original texture and color without any noticeable artifacts or unnatural smoothing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the front view of the apple on the right appears to maintain a consistent texture and natural-looking color of the skin. The surface is smooth, just like a real apple, and doesn't show any signs of editing artifacts or unnatural alterations. This is visually supported by the retention of a natural sheen and the organic speckles typical to apple skin.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?",
    "explanation": "The cross-section of the apple on the left in Image B shows the flesh with a natural appearance, capturing the fine details and slight irregularities typical of an apple. The texture appears realistic, with visible grain, and does not appear overly smooth or tampered with, depicting a credible representation of an apple's interior.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the top view of the appleâ€™s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the top view of the apple, presenting the stem and calyx with appropriate proportions and geometry that align with expected realism. The stem is centered and the indentation around it looks natural without any noticeable distortions or artifacts, maintaining an authentic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the apple's front view, cross-section, and top view all exhibit coherence in terms of shape, size, and texture. The apple maintains a reasonable similarity in scale and detail consistency, supporting structural coherence without contradictions, seamlessly integrating all views of the apple realistically.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?",
    "explanation": "Lighting and shadows in Image B are consistent across the different perspectives of the apple. The light source appears to be the same in all views, casting similar shadows and highlights on the apple's skin and inside the cross-section, which suggests a unified and natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
