    "Question": "Q1: Are the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle smooth, continuous, and free of jagged edges or unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "The swirling ocean wave patterns are observed within the crystal bottle, appearing to be crafted to mimic the natural form of ocean waves. The patterns should appear smooth and continuous to replicate realism. In Image B, the wave patterns show no visible jagged edges or unnatural distortions, indicating that the design has been executed smoothly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label occupy the correct area, maintain sharp edges, and show no signs of pixelation or smudging?",
    "explanation": "Golden maritime symbols on the bottle label should occupy the designated area and maintain crisp, sharp edges to ensure clarity and elegance. In Image B, these symbols appear to be well-positioned with clear and sharp edges, showing no signs of pixelation or smudging, reflecting a high-quality execution.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the compass rose at the top of the packaging have evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections and no misalignment or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The compass rose is a detailed design element that should display precision with evenly spaced points and realistic metallic reflections. In Image B, the compass rose's points are indeed evenly spaced, accurately aligned, and exhibit realistic reflections. There are no noticeable clipping artifacts, suggesting the design's integrity is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body seamless, with no abrupt breaks or geometric deformations?",
    "explanation": "A seamless transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body involves a smooth, cohesive flow without interruptions. In Image B, the transition is visually smooth, with no abrupt breaks or evidence of geometric distortions, ensuring the overall design appears fluid and continuous.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the parchment surface of the packaging display consistent aging texture without artificial streaks or uneven shading?",
    "explanation": "The parchment surface is expected to have a consistent aging texture that resembles authentic aging, displaying uniformity across the surface. In Image B, the packaging shows a consistent aging texture with no artificial streaks or uneven shading visible, indicating a realistic and coherent presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
