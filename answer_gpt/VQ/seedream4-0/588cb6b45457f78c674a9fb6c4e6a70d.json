    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the painted figure show consistent brushstroke patterns and subtle texture variations typical of oil paint on wood, without blocky or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the painting displays brushstroke patterns and subtle textures that mimic traditional oil paint applications on wood. These details add depth and realism, although inherent digital qualities are present, they don't dominate the overall natural texture appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the strands of the elongated beard and mustache maintain continuous, fiber-like structure without forming unnatural loops, droplets, or fluid-like surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the strands of the beard and mustache as elongated and fiber-like, maintaining a natural flow and continuous structure. There are no loops or droplet formations which might suggest a fluid-like appearance, ensuring that the beard and mustache look visually consistent with natural hair.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the velvet texture of the cloak smooth and reflective with depth, and are the golden embroidery lines evenly spaced and aligned with the fabric folds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the velvet texture of the cloak appears smooth, reflective, and conveys depth. The golden embroidery lines are spaced evenly and align well with the folds of the fabric, showing craftsmanship that mimics a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wide-brimmed hat positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape, and are the peacock feathers attached along the brim with natural curvature and no clipping into the face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat in Image B is correctly positioned on the head without altering the inherent shape. The peacock feathers show a natural curvature and are attached naturally along the brim, without any clipping into surrounding regions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the brooch cast a soft shadow onto the cloak and reflect light consistently with its surroundings, indicating proper placement and integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brooch in Image B casts a soft shadow on the cloak, reflecting light in a manner consistent with neighboring elements. These lighting effects suggest proper integration, avoiding eccentricities or inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the edges of the figure cleanly separated from the background without haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency that suggests poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's edges show a clean separation from the background. There are no signs of haloing, double outlines, or partial transparency, which would indicate poor compositing. The separation appears seamless and well-executed.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the original face, with no stretching or warping caused by adjacent edits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the facial details are blurred, the assessment focuses on ensuring adjacent edits do not cause undue distortion to alignment. Considering the rest of the edits maintain integrity in positioning and proportionality, there's a reasonable inference that symmetry is preserved.",
