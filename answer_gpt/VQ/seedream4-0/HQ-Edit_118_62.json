      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a rounded, soft-bodied shape with no visible distortion in limbs or head, and does it maintain a natural posture consistent with a seated stuffed animal?",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush pigeon in Image B has a rounded and soft-bodied shape consistent with typical stuffed animals.

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue and gray areas on the plush pigeonâ€™s body evenly colored with soft transitions, and do the feather-like patterns appear as continuous, low-relief designs on fabric rather than sharp, digital lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush pigeon features blue and gray areas that are smoothly blended without harsh edges, indicative of soft transitions in color typical in fabric toys. The feather-like patterns are gently embossed, resembling a low-relief design in fabric rather than digital graphics, which would often include sharp lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the architectural elements (columns, arch, distant buildings) display a uniform, matte surface with visible embossed details that resemble cookie dough or icing, and do they lack shiny reflections or metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural elements in Image B are crafted with a non-reflective, matte finish that mimics the texture of cookie dough or icing. This is evidenced by the embossed details on the columns and arch, emphasizing a confectionery appeal rather than any metallic shine.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden shelf beneath the plush pigeon that is flat, horizontally aligned, and has visible wood grain and natural edge wear, with a shadow extending downward and to the right consistent with the sky light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A wooden shelf is indeed present under the plush pigeon in Image B, characterized by a flat and horizontal alignment. The wood grain is visibly detailed, and slight edge wear is consistent with natural wood textures. The shadow cast extends downward and to the right, aligning consistently with the lighting direction inferred from the image's sky.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all elements in the image (plush pigeon, shelf, cookie structures) share the same lighting direction and shadow behavior, with no overlapping shadows or missing occlusions that suggest inconsistent depth or positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements, including the plush pigeon, shelf, and cookie structures, appear subject to the same lighting direction and shadow behavior. Shadows are consistently cast and do not overlap incorrectly, which suggests proper depth perception and accurate positioning relative to each light source.",
