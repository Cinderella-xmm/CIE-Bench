      "question": "Does the transition from the realistic depiction of the patient to the pop-art comic design appear smooth without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a noticeable transformation from realistic elements to those stylized in pop-art comic design. This transition employs characteristic halftone patterns and bold lines. While these patterns add a textured effect that is typical for comic-style artwork, they may appear to introduce some roughness compared to smooth realistic textures. However, they are consistent with the pop-art theme rather than being unintended artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the halftone patterns and bold graphical details added to the image consistent with the rest of the scene and do not look out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone patterns and bold lines are intentionally used to suggest shading and depth in pop-art style. In Image B, these elements are uniformly applied across the scene to the patient, monitors, and medical staff. The coherent use of these comic-style features helps the entire image achieve a unified artistic appearance, minimizing the impression of inconsistency or distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the core elements like the IV stand, monitors, and nurse retain their structural integrity and remain visually credible within the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural integrity of elements such as the IV stand, monitors, and nurse is maintained, albeit with a stylized twist appropriate for comic art. The outlines are bold, yet the forms are recognizable and are consistent with a comic-book style. Therefore, these components retain their credibility within the chosen art form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the shapes of objects such as the bed, pillows, and medical equipment been preserved without distortion or damage in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the same objects (bed, pillows, and medical equipment) with a stylized design using bold outlines and halftone patterns. Despite the artistic modifications, the essential shapes of these objects are kept intact, avoiding distortion that would otherwise detract from their recognizability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the patient's facial features and the nurse's uniform preserved without loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts in the pop-art comic design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, facial features and similar details are altered because of the transformation into pop-art comic style. Fine details are simulated using bold outlines and shading through halftone patterns. Though finer details are simplified, they are replaced by new stylistic detail typical for comics, not random artifacts.",
