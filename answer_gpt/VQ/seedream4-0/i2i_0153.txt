    "Question": "Q1: Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is illustrated in a cartoonish style, where straight lines and surfaces are depicted smoothly. The truck maintains its proportionate elements, such as the cab, wheels, and chassis, consistent with a heavy-duty truck. The artistic style simplifies the shapes but preserves the integrity of the truck's overall form, aligning with how such vehicles are typically represented in comics or animated visuals. As there are no visual signs of disproportion or broken geometry, the truck's proportions and structural integrity appear to be maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, due to its cartoon-like representation, the level of detail is intentionally reduced compared to a realistic photograph. The truck's surfaces, including the cab, wheels, and grille, are illustrated with smooth colors and simplified patterns, typical for this drawing style. There are no unnatural artifacts present despite the minimalistic detailing, which is characteristic of animated renderings. Given this context, the textures and surfaces are appropriate for the chosen style and are free from any unnatural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cab is depicted in a bright red color, consistent with the typical cartoon representation of vehicles. The vibrant color is balanced with thick black outlines and other accompanying color shades in the wheels and metallic parts, all suited to the animated style. The use of bold colors against a flat background does not introduce any unrealistic contrasts because it is intentional within the context of a cartoon environment. Thus, the vibrancy of the colors is consistent and natural within this artistic framework.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is composed of simple outlines and colors representing trees and clouds in a flat artistic manner, which seamlessly merges with the truck's cartoon style. There are no complicated or detailed elements in the background that could distract from the truck, and the simplicity complements the truck's presentation. This style ensures that the scene remains coherent without any out-of-place elements that could break the flow or authenticity of the animated context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are depicted with bold, rounded outlines and evenly spaced lug nuts, typical of a quality animated rendering. There are no indications of distortion or misalignment; each wheel sits firmly on its axis, matching the symmetry expected in such illustrations. The adherence to the logical structure of truck wheels, despite simplified details, ensures that the vehicle's credibility is preserved in this visual style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
