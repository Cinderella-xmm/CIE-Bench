      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain a natural texture similar to the original kangaroo's fur, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure box is designed to look like a typical product packaging with printed graphics and text. Such boxes usually have smooth surfaces with printed images, which differ from the texture of a real kangaroo's fur. The box surface in Image B, as seen, has clean text and graphics, typical of product packaging, without mimicking the natural fur texture of a kangaroo. The finish on the box is smooth rather than textured like fur.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the box retain the correct proportions and structural consistency, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style kangaroo figure inside the Funko Pop box is designed with exaggerated features typical of chibi characters, such as a larger head and smaller body, while retaining a balanced structure characteristic of such figures. The proportions appear consistent without any visible distortions or deformations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the highly realistic kangaroo figure outside the packaging display detailed textures and lighting consistent with the original image, enhancing its visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kangaroo figure next to the packaging exhibits a high degree of realism, showing intricate fur detail and realistic lighting. This is consistent with how a real kangaroo would appear, similar to the kangaroo in Image A. The attention to texture and lighting enhances its plausibility, making it appear life-like within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grassy base and hopping-related elements integrated naturally into the chibi-style kangaroo figure, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style kangaroo is placed on a grassy base inside the box. This base looks like a typical stylized design often seen with collectible figures to add thematic context and does not show unnatural textures despite not mimicking the real grass exactly. Details are well-maintained, consistent with the overall stylization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the Funko Pop figure box and the realistic kangaroo figure beside it appear visually credible and structurally coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop figure box and the realistic kangaroo are placed together in a way that respects spatial relationships and lighting consistency within the scene. The kangaroo figure is proportionately sized next to the box, and the lighting on both the box and kangaroo matches, making the composition believable and coherent.",
