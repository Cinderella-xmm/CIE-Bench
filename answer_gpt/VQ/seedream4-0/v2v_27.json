        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat's eyes are drawn in a cartoonish and expressive style, which is typical in chibi or sticker designs.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the wombat in various playful poses, typical of sticker designs. These poses exhibit cartoonish exaggeration and creativity, such as showing different expressions and activities. Despite this exaggerated portrayal, which is intentional for such design, each pose maintains structural consistency regarding the wombat's body proportions and movements expected in cartoon art. This consistency ensures visual credibility in relation to cartoon design principles.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wombat is shown wearing a Hawaiian shirt and straw hat with simplified textures suitable for sticker art. The shirt's floral patterns and large dots are clearly visible without artifacts, maintaining a coherent design across all poses. The straw hat is consistent in design, and features the same color scheme and texture in all instances. This reflects the clean, illustrative style commonly used in sticker art.",
