      "question": "Does the person's face retain its structural coherence with natural shading and texture in the soft illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image uses a soft illustration style, which typically transforms real photo elements into more stylized, often simplified versions. Despite the face being blurred, the transition to illustration should ideally maintain natural coherence with typical illustration shading and textures for faces. This would involve seeing clear yet stylistically consistent approximations of facial features, even if details are obscured.",

      "question": "Are the teddy bears, including their shirts' text and proportions, depicted coherently and naturally in the soft illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the teddy bears should transition from a realistic to a stylized softer illustration style while retaining their overall shape and the text on their shirts should remain discernible and naturally integrated with the bearsâ€™ features. The soft illustration must redefine texture while maintaining coherence in proportion and alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the handwritten text at the top appear naturally integrated into the image without introducing visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of handwritten text in illustrations often blends seamlessly with the overall composition if executed well. In the edited image, the text 'Some friends come with hugs' should appear as part of the art style, without standing out as an additional overlay. The integration should seem natural, without visible pixelation or mismatches with background textures.",

      "question": "Does the beige sofa maintain its natural texture and color, contributing to the warm and cozy tone of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In a soft illustration style, the sofa should exhibit a consistent transition in texture and color from the original photo. The edited image should depict the sofa's texture in a way that complements the warm color palette and cozy tone often associated with soft illustrations.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition, including the person, teddy bears, and added text, preserve visual credibility and a warm, cozy atmosphere in the soft illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To maintain visual credibility in the soft illustration style, all elements including the person (apart from the blurred face), teddy bears, and the added text should appear cohesively integrated. The consistency in style coupled with the warm color palette contributes to creating a cozy atmosphere. The transformation should reflect a scene that could believably exist as a coherent illustration.",
