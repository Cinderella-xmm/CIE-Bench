      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elderâ€™s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face area is blurred and doesn't provide visible details of the facial wrinkles or skin texture. However, the face's rendering style aligns with the surrounding cartoon-like characteristics, suggesting a smoother and more stylized approach. Considering this, it is likely that the face is drawn with a level of artificial smoothing typical of cartoon-style illustrations.",
