      "question": "Does the lighting on the man and the pineapple appear consistent with the new aged blackboard background, without introducing unnatural shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the man and the pineapple is warm and directional, similar to the original image. The chalkboard also has a warm tone and subtle shadows that match this lighting, suggesting the integration was done considering the light source direction and intensity, maintaining consistency without introducing unrealistic shadows or highlights.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts or unnatural edges where the man and the pineapple meet the new aged blackboard background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the edges where the man and the pineapple meet the new background appear smooth and natural. There are no visible cut lines, jagged edges, or color mismatches indicating a potential artifact from editing. The transition between the subjects and the background is seamless.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the chalk-written equations and galactic sketches on the new blackboard background integrate naturally with the man and the pineapple, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chalk-written equations and galactic sketches in Image B occupy the background without interfering with or overshadowing the main subjects - the man and the pineapple. The placement and orientation of the drawings complement the scene, integrating naturally in a manner that maintains visual balance and coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the proportions and details of the man and the pineapple been preserved, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image B with Image A, both images maintain consistent proportions and details in the man and the pineapple. The texture and structure of the subjects remain intact, indicating no distortion or loss of fine details during the integration with the new background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the texture of the new aged blackboard background complement the man and the pineapple, without introducing any unnatural or conflicting textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the blackboard in Image B is matte and slightly aged, complementing the rustic and organic textures of the manâ€™s clothing and the pineapple. There is no noticeable clash or unnatural discrepancy in texture, ensuring that the elements harmoniously fit together in the composition.",
