    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bookmark version of the central golden curved skyscraper maintain a smooth, continuous curve without broken or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarks are representations of skyscrapers, including the central golden one. Analyzing the curvature of the bookmark's surface involves checking its smoothness and continuity. The bookmark's design is flat, meaning it should smoothly replicate the curved shape without interruptions or jagged edges. The bookmark does maintain a smooth curve without broken or jagged edges, reflecting the smooth, continuous lines typical of the original building's silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sharp angles and vertical lines of the angular black skyscraper bookmark clearly defined and geometrically consistent without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bookmark representing the angular black skyscraper must capture its sharp angles and straight vertical lines, consistent with the building's design. The angular and vertical characteristics are visible and clearly defined, indicating precise geometric execution without distortion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the horizontal steps of the stepped golden building bookmark remain distinct and evenly spaced without merging or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark version of the stepped golden building should have distinct steps that are evenly spaced, reflecting its architectural design. Analyzing the bookmark's depiction shows clear, separate steps with consistent spacing, avoiding any merging or overlapping.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vertical lines and window patterns on the rectangular high-rise bookmark aligned and evenly spaced without warping or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rectangular high-rise bookmark design involves consistent vertical lines and structured window patterns that align properly, ensuring they are evenly spaced. The evaluation of the bookmarks indicates that the lines and patterns maintain their alignment without any warping or missing parts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the gold and silver glazes on the bookmarks show consistent reflective highlights without scattered noise or unnatural glittering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmarks feature gold and silver finishes that should have consistent highlights indicative of a uniform metallic surface. Inspecting the reflectivity, they exhibit a coherent shining effect without scattered noise or unnatural glittering that would suggest an uneven texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the etched outlines on all bookmarks continuous, unbroken, and aligned with the edges of the shapes without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Etched outlines provide detail and definition to the bookmark designs. For accuracy, these outlines should follow the shapes' edges precisely. Observing the bookmarks, the etched outlines are continuous, unbroken, and align correctly with the edges, maintaining structural integrity without incorrect intersections.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the bookmarks positioned on the book with correct perspective and shadows that suggest they are resting on a flat surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the positioning of the bookmarks involves checking their perspective and shadow casting to confirm they appear to rest on a flat surface realistically. The angle and shadows in the edited image suggest the bookmarks rest on the book surface naturally, without any signs of floating or unrealistic overlap.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the stars and wave doodles drawn in a consistent cartoon style and placed within the margins of the book without overlapping the bookmarks or appearing misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The doodles consist of stars and waves, which should exemplify a coherent cartoon style within the book's layout. Their positioning respects the book margins and they do not overlap or misalign with the bookmarks, maintaining an ordered and stylistic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q9",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, color bleeding, or ghosting at the borders of the bookmarks or between the bookmarks and the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Quality evaluation of the bookmarks includes checking for visual artifacts like jagged edges, color bleeding, or ghosting that could affect clarity. Image B doesn't present such artifacts, ensuring the borders remain clean and the transition between the bookmarks and the book is smooth.",
