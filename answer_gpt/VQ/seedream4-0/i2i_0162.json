      "question": "Does the mouse's fur texture appear smooth and maintain the natural look expected in a Pixar-style animation without unnatural or overly simplified patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouseâ€™s fur texture exhibits a style typical for Pixar animations, characterized by smoothness and detailed rendering. The use of gentle gradients and subtle detailing aligns with the stylistic approach often used to create lifelike yet stylistically consistent textures in animations. Thus, the fur retains a natural appearance without overly simplified or unrealistic patterns.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mouse with enlarged eyes and slightly exaggerated ears and whiskers, typical in Pixar animations to convey expressiveness and charm.

      "question": "Do the soft shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs appear naturally integrated into the scene without any harsh or misplaced artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are soft and blend smoothly with the scene, consistent with the lighting style often employed in Pixar animations to enhance realism and depth. The shadows are appropriately placed beneath the mouse and crumbs, contributing to the integration without any harsh edges or misplaced effects.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B maintains the appearance consistent with animated scenes, showcasing a realistic tile pattern despite the stylized nature. The texture is smooth yet detailed enough to mimic real surfaces, ensuring it does not appear unnaturally smoothed or display artificial patterns.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows crumbs that are varied but consistent in size and shape, maintaining the believability of scattered food particles on the floor. This consistency aligns with the natural look within animated representation, avoiding any signs of distorted or irregular formation.",
