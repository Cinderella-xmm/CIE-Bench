      "question": "Does the line-art representation of the elderly man maintain accurate proportions and natural joint alignment in his tai chi stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man's stance is a critical aspect of the composition, particularly for a tai chi pose, which requires accurate depiction of balance and joint alignment. The line-art style focuses on simplicity, yet it's necessary to retain realistic proportions to convey the fluidity and precision of the tai chi movement. The alignment of the limbs and torso in Image B suggests a careful attention to anatomical detail, reflecting a natural and proportionate posture.",

      "question": "Are the pastel watercolor tones applied uniformly across the scene, preserving smooth gradients and avoiding harsh edges or inconsistent color zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes pastel watercolor tones which are typically soft and blended. This style should ensure that colors transition smoothly without abrupt changes in intensity or saturation. In the image, the colors in the background are subtle and seamlessly integrated, maintaining smooth gradients and avoiding any harsh edges, indicative of a cohesive application of pastel watercolor tones.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom patterns integrated naturally into the background, maintaining depth and perspective consistency with the existing trees and mist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Cherry blossoms in the background of Image B should be consistent with the overall depth and perspective established by the trees and mist. The depiction of cherry blossoms appears natural, aligning with the existing landscape elements proportionately. The softness of the watercolor technique helps blend the blossoms into the scene, enhancing depth perception and maintaining perspective consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the date grids placed in a way that respects the spatial boundaries of the scene, such as being anchored to the ground or wall without overlapping the man’s body or distorting his silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of date grids in Image B is crucial for ensuring they do not interfere with the main subject or the aesthetic flow. The grids are placed strategically at the top of the image, separated from the man’s posture, ensuring that they do not overlap or distort the visual narrative smoothness of the tai chi stance, thereby respecting spatial boundaries.",

      "question": "Does the hand forming the \"OK\" gesture have exactly five fingers, with natural joint curvature and no elongated, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand gesture involves careful drawing which should realistically represent human anatomy. The depiction shows five fingers with natural joint curvature, and the anatomy appears correctly proportioned without any abnormalities such as elongated, missing, or duplicated digits, realistically conveying the 'OK' gesture.",
