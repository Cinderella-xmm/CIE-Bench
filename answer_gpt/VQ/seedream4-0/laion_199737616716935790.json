      "question": "Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the body panels of the motorcycle constructed from bricks are visibly angular and maintain a consistent pattern. The bricks appear to align well with the angular design typical to such motorcycles. The color distribution is consistent, maintaining a sharp and clean geometric aesthetic with clear angles and separations between the black and blue bricks. This reflects a typical Lego construction style which supports angular designs. Thus, the alignment and geometric consistency is achieved effectively through the careful arrangement of bricks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle's cog-patterned rims are composed of numerous small bricks arranged to form a circular shape. The teeth on the rims are evenly spaced and follow the circular shape accurately, maintaining the proportionality appropriate for the diameter of the wheels. The construction does not exhibit any stretching or broken segments; rather, it resembles an accurate replication of typical motorcycle rims using brick textures.",

      "question": "Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decals present on the motorcycle are visually integrated onto brick surfaces without any visible disruptions such as gaps or overlaps. The decals are applied so that they appear to follow the surface contours of the brick composition naturally, without artificial layering or misalignment. The meticulous placement shows effective graphic embedding technique.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycleâ€™s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the gray baseplate upon which the motorcycle is positioned appears flat and even. It showcases a continuous surface which supports the motorcycle effectively, with the wheels resting on it without any perceived mismatch in height or distortion. This demonstrates a well-constructed base to properly accommodate and display the motorcycle model without disruption in surface uniformity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case enclosing the motorcycle model has clearly defined boundaries. It is constructed to be transparent and free from distortions like ghosting or refraction errors that could impact the visibility of the motorcycle. The absence of unintended shadowing effects further supports the clarity of presentation within the case, allowing the motorcycle to be viewed unobstructed.",
