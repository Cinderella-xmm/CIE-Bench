    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms on the pie’s surface appear to fit well with the overall color and texture of the crust, as seen with the correct shadows and color blending. The consistent shading and absence of obvious digital artifacts indicate they are well-integrated into the pie's surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lattice pattern of the pie is transformed to resemble a draped fabric apron. The structure and spacing of the lattice work are preserved, and it does not exhibit signs of distortion or improper alignment, indicating that the transformation maintains the pattern’s integrity.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife is morphed into a feather pen where the structure is consistent throughout, showing a smooth transition from the former knife shape into a quill pen, complete with realistic feather detailing and a wooden-looking shaft. There are no abrupt edges or mismatches in texture, demonstrating a cohesive conversion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added pastries in Image B are scaled proportionately to the main pie and positioned evenly around it. They cast shadows in the same direction as other elements in the scene, consistent with the lighting source, demonstrating a realistic integration into the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubbles appear near the mouth of the pie, are clear and easily readable without interfering with or overlapping onto the pie or plate, ensuring they are intact and properly integrated into the image layout.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands depicted in Image B on the pie each possess the anatomically correct number of fingers (five each) with aligned joints. They are gripping the feather pen naturally, showing no signs of distortion or additional fingers, reflecting proper anatomy in their design.",
