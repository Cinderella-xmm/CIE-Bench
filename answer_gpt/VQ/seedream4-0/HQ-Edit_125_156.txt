    "Question": "Q1: Is the magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf visually consistent in size, shape, and material, with a shadow extending toward the desk that matches the lighting direction from the window?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the magnifying glass is placed on the floor near the scattered papers, not on the bookshelf. It appears consistent with an ordinary handheld magnifying glass in size, shape, and material, typically composed of metal and glass. The shadow of the magnifying glass extends toward the desk, aligning with the lighting direction from the window as suggested by the shadow areas across the room. However, there is an inconsistency in the description, as no magnifying glass is visible on the bookshelf.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the ghostly outline of the detective in a trench coat appear as a translucent, softly blended form within the stained-glass window pattern, maintaining the integrity of the original design and showing no jagged edges or inconsistent opacity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ghostly outline of the detective appears as a silhouette on the curtains rather than within the stained-glass window pattern. The silhouette is blended softly and maintains smooth edges without appearing jagged. The translucent appearance is consistent with the shadowy form usually seen in ghostly or spectral representations, but the stained-glass window pattern is no longer visible, as it appears to have been replaced or covered by the curtain.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the deep sepia tones applied consistently across all surfaces including the wooden desk, bookshelves, floor, and window, preserving fine details like wood grain and book spines without introducing blotchy or uneven color patches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is engulfed in sepia tones, maintaining a consistent application across various surfaces like the desk, bookshelves, and floor. The details such as wood grain and book spines are still visible, suggesting no blotchy or uneven patches, which often occur if colorization processes are poorly executed. The sepia tone gives a warm, antique aesthetic consistent across the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the title 'The Lost Legacy' positioned at the top of the image in a bold serif font that is clearly legible, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly overlaid without obscuring the ceiling details or causing visual disruption to the surrounding ornate patterns?",
    "explanation": "The title 'The Lost Legacy' is visibly positioned at the top of Image B in a bold serif font. It is legible and scaled relative to the overall image, not disproportionately large or small. The title is placed over the curtain without obscuring any intricate details in the ceiling or causing disruption to the ornate patterns surrounding the scene. This placement allows the title to be a significant focal point without compromising other visual elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the added elements—the magnifying glass and the ghostly figure—integrate seamlessly into the scene without distorting adjacent objects, altering lighting logic, or introducing visible artifacts such as misaligned edges or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the magnifying glass and the ghostly figure are added elements. The magnifying glass rests on the floor without disturbing the surrounding papers, suggesting a smooth integration into the scene. The ghostly figure appears as a silhouette on the curtain without altering the lighting logic—its shadowy form aligns with typical light direction. There are no noticeable artifacts such as misaligned edges or repeated textures with the additions, indicating seamless integration into the existing visual context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
