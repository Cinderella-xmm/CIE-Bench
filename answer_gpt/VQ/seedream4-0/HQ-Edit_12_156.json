      "question": "Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enchanted vines wrapped around the Eiffel Tower appear to flow smoothly and align well with the original structural lines of the tower. This alignment suggests a well-thought-out integration with the tower's design. The vines do not exhibit jagged edges or inconsistent thickness, indicating a deliberate and consistent design. In contrast, Image A shows the traditional lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower without any vines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing floral motifs on the tower in Image B emit light that seems uniformly distributed, complementing the overall warm ambient lighting from the sunset. The soft glows harmonize with the sunset tones, without abrupt brightness changes or disconnects that could disrupt the visual consistency. The lighting effect appears cohesive and integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone platform in Image B looks symmetrically positioned relative to the tower's legs. Its size is proportionally scaled to accommodate the base of the tower securely. There is no visible warping or misalignment, suggesting the platform's integration is purposeful and stable. The symmetry and proportionality are consistent with architectural principles.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arcane symbols on the stone platform in Image B are arranged in an evenly spaced and properly oriented fashion. They exhibit depth and shadowing effects, suggesting they are carved into the stone and not just surface-level decorations. The shadowing creates a three-dimensional impression consistent with actual engravings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the towerâ€™s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The swirling nebulae in Image B start near the base of the tower and flow upward smoothly, integrating with the rest of the night sky. The transition between the nebulae and the orange gradient of the sky is seamless, without any sharp edges or disconnected patches, enhancing the mystical and harmonious visual effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal pinnacle in Image B exhibits distinct facets that are reflective and catch the light effectively. The facets display subtle refractions, maintaining clarity and sharpness without any blurriness or geometric distortion. This sharpness and reflectivity contribute to the crystal-like appearance expected from such materials.",
