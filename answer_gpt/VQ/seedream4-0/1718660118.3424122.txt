    "Question": "Q1: Do the brass and copper elements on the uniform show natural surface variations, such as subtle scratches, patina, and reflective highlights, without appearing uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy?",
    "explanation": "The brass and copper elements have been designed to showcase a variety of textures that suggest natural aging or wear. The presence of scratches and patina on these elements indicates an effort to create a more realistic depiction rather than an overly smooth, glossy surface, which would suggest newness rather than use.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gear components on the uniform properly embedded within the fabric structure, maintaining consistent depth and avoiding overlapping or misaligned teeth that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing the gear components on the uniform reveals that they appear to be well integrated into the design. The alignment and embedding within the fabric look consistent, and there are no visible signs of overlapping or misaligned gears that would disrupt the visual continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the copper, brown, and dark green hues distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background, with transitions between colors following natural lighting gradients and avoiding abrupt or patchy changes?",
    "explanation": "The color distribution across the uniform, throne, and background seems even, with smooth transitions that follow natural lighting gradients. There are no abrupt or patchy changes that disrupt the visual harmony, supporting a cohesive aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the steam trails in the background have gradual opacity and wispy edges, flowing naturally from potential sources like vents or machinery, without sharp outlines or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "Observing the steam trails reveals they possess wispy edges that transition smoothly in opacity, suggesting a natural flow from vents or machinery. There aren't any sharp outlines or pixelation, contributing to a realistic depiction of steam behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"
