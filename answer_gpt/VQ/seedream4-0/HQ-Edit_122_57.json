      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the crystal vase appears shaped to mirror the overall form and proportions of the ceramic vase seen in Image A. The key features, such as the curvature and the ornate design on the handles, seem retained in the crystal rendition, but translated into a faceted surface typical of crystal structures. Based on the analysis, the crystal vase does maintain the original shape and proportions without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns etched into the crystal vase are clear and distinct, showcasing depth and uniformity. These patterns are sharp and artistic, mimicking a style similar to the painted designs on Image A's ceramic vase. The appearance does not suggest any superimposition or blurring, indicating precision and craftsmanship typical of etched crystal objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bouquet of crystal flowers that preserve the identifiable shapes of the blooms found in Image A. These crystal flowers exhibit internal refraction, creating a shimmering effect, and present pastel colors that enhance their translucency. Unlike in solid or opaque forms, these flowers display a see-through quality, demonstrating the properties of cut crystal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal under the crystal vase is clearly mirrored, which is evident from the sharp reflections of both the vase's base and the flowers. The reflection appears undistorted, indicative of a flat and highly reflective surface, thus verifying correct mirroring properties.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is carefully applied to create realistic refraction effects within the crystal elements. There is an internal glow and soft highlights present, showcasing the properties of crystal under light. The careful avoidance of unnatural bright spots or flat shading ensures that the image maintains an authentic look of crystal objects.",
