    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D character's face is intentionally designed to follow a chibi style, which inherently simplifies facial details and alters proportions for stylistic effect. This style naturally involves a larger head and simplified facial features, which do not aim to retain realistic facial details and instead prioritize a cute aesthetic. Since the artwork's intent aligns with the chibi style rather than realistic facial rendering, the character does not exhibit unnatural distortions or artifacts within this context.",
