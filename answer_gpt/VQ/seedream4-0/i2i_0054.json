      "question": "Does the newly added matte gray background appear uniform and free of any distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears as a solid matte gray color, creating a uniform surface. There are no visible gradients, distortions, or unusual textures that stand out. The gray is consistent throughout, which is typically achieved using digital editing tools to ensure a seamless backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the absence of shadows make the elephant appear unnaturally floating or disconnected from the surface beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the matte gray background provides no visual cues about lighting or surface, and without the shadow that could anchor the elephant, it can look like itâ€™s not firmly placed on the ground. Shadows are essential for conveying depth and connection to a surface, and their absence can cause a floating effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures on the elephant's skin preserved without noticeable loss after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures and fine details on the elephant's skin are indeed preserved. The wrinkles and rough skin patterns are clear and distinct, suggesting competent editing that preserved these aspects despite changing the background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the absence of banana shape and metal stand curves, which were not part of the original elephant image, result in any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana shape and metal stand curves are no longer visible. This removal does not introduce any new artifacts or inconsistencies since these objects were in the background, and their absence does not affect the natural appearance of the elephant.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain its correct proportions and physical rationality relative to the new matte gray background, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant maintains its correct proportions and physical appearance. The removal of the original background and substitution with a plain gray one does not affect the dimensions or realism of the elephant itself, which remains natural without any distortion.",
