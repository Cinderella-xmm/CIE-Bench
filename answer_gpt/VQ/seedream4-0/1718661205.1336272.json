      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a LEGO representation of a military ship. The LEGO model appears to maintain the original shape and structural proportions quite effectively. LEGO pieces are known for their precise interlocking capabilities, and the ship’s structure reflects this consistency without noticeable distortions or misaligned bricks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO ocean waves are constructed using varied heights and placements of LEGO pieces to create a textured effect. This technique captures the undulating nature of waves, signifying an attempt to mimic natural wave motion rather than being completely flat or rigid.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the scene depicted in Image B, the LEGO accessories on the boat deck, such as the life vest and other details, are appropriately scaled relative to the LEGO figure present. This ensures harmony in perspective and proportion throughout the model.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt retain their original colors and show no signs of unnatural texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure’s life vest and shirt are depicted with consistent colors and detailing typical of LEGO figures. There are no visible signs of texture repetition issues, pixelation, or mismatched edges, ensuring the image maintains LEGO’s usual aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO model placed on a shelf, which is depicted with clear structural integrity and spatial coherence. The lighting and shadows on the shelf and model give depth cues that enhance the realism of the geometric arrangement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model is constructed cleanly without observable artifacts like jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces. This ensures the illusion of a coherent and complete LEGO build is maintained.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
