      "question": "Does the chibi version of the scientist retain the white lab coat and light blue shirt without any unnatural distortions in shape or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi scientist characters are designed with stylized features, typical of such illustrations. The white lab coat and light blue shirt are distinct and retain their color consistency across multiple characters. The chibi style inherently comes with certain exaggerations or simplifications, but there is no distortion in shape or texture that appears unnatural within this context.",

      "question": "Are the scientist's beard and hair depicted naturally in the chibi style, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi style of Image B, the scientist's features such as hair are simplified and stylized but are consistent with typical depictions of characters in this style. The texture and arrangement appear normal for chibi art. There is no significant loss of detail evident beyond the normal, artistic simplifications characteristic of chibi representations.",

      "question": "Do the background elements, including the bright green color and hexagonal patterns, enhance the chibi scientist stickers without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a bright green with hexagonal patterns that complement the scientific theme of the stickers. These elements are uniform and do not disrupt the visualization of the chibi characters; they serve to enhance the thematic context without any noticeable artifacts or visual issues.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In all six poses, do the scientist's hands have the correct number of fingers and appear naturally shaped without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi scientist characters in Image B display simplified hands typical of chibi art, where details such as fingers may be stylized. Despite this simplification, they are consistent with the intended art style and do not show distortions or unnatural shapes in the context of chibi animation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi scientist characters show various expressions and actions aligned with a scientific theme. These expressions and actions are not only stylistically consistent with the exaggerated features of chibi art but also appear coherent and plausible within this artistic framework without any signs of unnatural or distorted features.",
