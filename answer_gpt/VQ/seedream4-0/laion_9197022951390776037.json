      "question": "Are the eyes positioned just below the label and do they follow the curvature of the bottle with consistent lighting and reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes appear positioned just below the label on the bottle. They follow the curvature of the bottle as evidenced by their rounded shape which aligns with the cylindrical form of the bottle. The lighting and reflection on the eyes are consistent with the rest of the bottle, blending naturally into the image. This gives the impression that the eyes are indeed part of the bottle design and have been integrated thoughtfully into the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vines wrap around the bottle in a continuous, physically plausible manner without floating or intersecting the bottle in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines appear to wrap around the bottle in a way that suggests they are actually climbing it. The vines show natural growth patterns, and their positioning and shadows suggest contact with the surface of the bottle. There are no visible signs of the vines floating or intersecting the bottle unnaturally, making their presence seem plausible and consistent with how vines might cling to a physical object.",

      "question": "Is the modified label icon a clear, proportionate face with distinct features that match the original icon's style and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label icon on the edited bottle in Image B maintains a clear and proportionate face with distinct features that match the original style seen in Image A. The scarecrow face design sits centrally on the label and maintains the same simplistic, recognizable look that is coherent with the logo style, suggesting no modifications that alter its recognizability or size proportion.",

      "question": "Does the background include layered grapevines and mist that recede naturally without obscuring or clipping the bottle incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features grapevines receding into the distance, creating a natural scene. The mist adds depth to the landscape, and every element appears to be correctly layered without obscuring or interfering with the visibility of the bottle. The background elements recede naturally without any noticeable clipping errors around the bottle, ensuring that it remains the focal point of the image.",

      "question": "Is the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure\" clearly visible, correctly positioned, and free from rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure\" is clearly visible, situated to the right of the bottle, and legible without signs of pixelation or color bleeding. The choice of font, size, and color contrasts well with the background, ensuring clear visibility and readability, indicating a high-quality rendering with no visual artifacts.",
