      "question": "Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical body of the tea canister appears smooth and consistent. The dragon engravings are seamlessly wrapped around its surface without distortion, maintaining the intricate detail seen in Image A's teapot. The cylindrical transformation respects the original scale and proportions, showing continuity from the teapot’s design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The screw cap in Image B shows a seamless integration with the canister body. The cap's metallic surface matches the sheen of the body, and the leaf embossing on the cap is fine and consistent. There are no visible seams or texture mismatches indicating a well-executed integration into the design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Dragon's Delight' follows the curve of the spout smoothly. The characters are clearly legible and evenly spaced, maintaining the consistency of the underlying metal texture without causing any distortion or unnatural shading. This alignment suggests careful attention to the integration of text design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tea leaf logo on the cap of Image B is centered precisely on the top. The logo features clean lines and uniform depth, indicating high-quality rendering. There are no jagged edges or inconsistent lighting, showing careful attention to detail in the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon engravings in Image B appear fully intact and are evenly distributed around the cylindrical body without noticeable gaps, repetition, or warping. The motion from the original teapot to the cylindrical form respects the details and proportion, maintaining the integrity of the engravings.",
