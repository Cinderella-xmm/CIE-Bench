      "question": "Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra are designed as transparent, tapered glass caps. They exhibit realistic behavior with light reflecting and refracting through the glass, which indicates smooth contours and a clear, glass-like material. This is indicative of the realism expected from transparent glass objects, drawing upon common knowledge of how glass interacts with light.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and central shaft showcase a smooth, gold-finish with consistent light reflection across the surface. There are no visible seams or breaks, a common characteristic of high-quality metalwork, indicating an uninterrupted design. The even reflection of light supports the assumption of a seamless gold finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo is observed as embossed on the base. It integrates seamlessly with the base's surface texture without causing irregularities in depth or light reflection, which are typical indicators of quality embossing without visible anomalies in professional finish surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, floral-engraved patterns are evident on the base. They follow the base's curvature naturally, without flattening or appearing as repetitive surface overlays, which reflects skilled craftsmanship. The distribution and integration with the contour suggest an even and natural design expected of expertly engraved patterns.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the script font label on the central tube adheres to the tube's curvature smoothly, reflecting a natural fit. There is no visible warping, stretching, or overlapping with surface details, which is a common issue when text is not properly mapped onto a curved surface. The handling of the label indicates meticulous attention to detail in maintaining text integrity on a curved object.",
