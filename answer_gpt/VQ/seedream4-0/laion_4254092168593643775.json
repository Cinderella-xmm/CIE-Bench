      "question": "Does the silhouette of the rider maintain correct limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural elongation or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette of the rider is depicted as a simple outline on the can. From the visual cues in Image B, it seems the silhouette features proportions typical of a human riding a motorcycle. There's no apparent elongation or compression of limbs seen; the outline accurately resembles the typical posture of a rider with arms bent slightly forward and the legs positioned correctly on the bike. The riding position looks natural, indicating correct limb proportions and joint alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sand streaks in the background smoothly blended with the motion blur and do they follow the direction of travel without sharp, unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sand streaks appear behind the motorcycle silhouette on the can, implying motion. The sand is depicted rising into the air in a smooth, swirling pattern, which is consistent with a motorcycle's movement on sand. There are no evident sharp breaks or unnatural transitions; the effect suggests continuity and fluidity in keeping with a typical riding scenario, enhancing the dynamic element of motion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the \"RaceFuel\" text clearly legible and positioned without obscuring key parts of the rider or motorcycle, and does it blend cohesively with the overall design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'RaceFuel' text is sizable and prominently displayed on the can in Image B. It runs across the midsection of the can, ensuring that the letters remain unobscured by other elements like graphics or the silhouette of the rider. The placement does not interfere with key figures, such as the rider silhouette. The text is contrasted well against the black background, ensuring legibility while maintaining coherence with the can’s racing-themed design.",

      "question": "Does the track outline in the upper-right corner form a continuous, closed loop without self-intersections or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The track outline present in Image B forms a complete circuit in the upper-right section of the can. A continuous, closed line suggests a track, as there are no visible segment breaks or self-intersections that would indicate errors in outlining. The design resembles a typical race track layout, adhering to the racing theme presented in the image without any interruptions.",

      "question": "Is the speedometer icon positioned correctly at the bottom of the image with a clear, non-deformed dial and needle pointing to maximum speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speedometer icon is located near the bottom, and it appears circular without distortion. The dial is uncluttered, and the needle is pointed towards the maximum region, indicating top speed. The appearance does not show any deformation or warping; it maintains clarity with the graphical language consistent throughout the can’s design.",
