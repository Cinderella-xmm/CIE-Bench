      "question": "Are the details and textures of the skateboarder and the urban background preserved despite the application of the faded effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the application of the faded effect does result in a noticeable reduction in the clarity and detail of the skateboarder and the backdrop. The faded effect has introduced a grainy texture that diminishes the sharpness and the fine details visible in the original image. The buildings and the trees behind the skateboarder are less distinct and appear slightly blurred due to the effect, indicating a loss of detail.",

      "question": "Does the white border and text \"11:13 AM\" blend naturally into the image without introducing any visual distractions or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the addition of the white border and the timestamp '11:13 AM' is visually coherent. The border creates a framing effect reminiscent of a Polaroid photograph, which is intentionally designed to be a part of the aesthetic. The white border uniformly surrounds the image, and the text is subtle enough at the bottom right, ensuring it doesn't disrupt the visual flow or distract from the main focus area, which is the skateboarder performing a trick.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper-like grain texture applied uniformly across the image without causing noticeable loss of detail or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessment of Image B reveals that the grain texture has been evenly applied throughout the image. While this texture contributes to a vintage feel, it does uniformly affect all areas from the skateboarder to the urban background without introducing specific unnatural patterns. The consistency of the texture prevents it from being visually distracting, although it does contribute to an overall loss of detail as analyzed prior.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical relationships between the skateboarder, the skateboard, and the background elements remain consistent and logical after applying the Polaroid effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, even with the faded Polaroid effect and added grain texture, the proportions of the skateboarder relative to the skateboard and background elements are preserved well. The skateboarder's size in relation to the building and trees, as well as the position above the skateboard in mid-air, remains logically consistent. The editing effect does not distort these physical relationships or introduce any scale inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edges of the skateboarder and the skateboard smooth and free from any unnatural artifacts or distortions resulting from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the edges of the skateboarder and the skateboard do show some signs of grain from the texture but remain mostly smooth without major unnatural distortions. The grain texture creates a soft boundary effect, but it's uniform and does not introduce noticeable artifacts or jagged edges typically associated with poor editing processes.",
