      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls maintain the recognizable shape and proportions of the giraffe without introducing unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a set of Russian nesting dolls styled as giraffes. Each doll retains the characteristic features of a giraffe, such as the long neck and the pattern on the body, adapted in a cartoonish manner without unnatural geometric distortions. This design choice ensures the dolls remain visually connected to the recognizable giraffe shape. Thus, they do maintain the giraffe's recognizable shape and proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the Russian nesting dolls consistent with the giraffe's fur pattern, avoiding unnatural or overly smooth surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textured appearance of the giraffe's fur pattern is artistically rendered on each nesting doll. While the surface of the dolls is likely smooth due to being painted objects, the visual detailing of the giraffe's spots effectively imitates the appearance of a real giraffeâ€™s fur patterns. This caricature approach harmonizes with the design choice while not appearing overly smooth, aligning with the realistic representation of the giraffe's patterns in the cartoon style.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the different sizes of the Russian nesting dolls smooth, without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are lined up in decreasing size and are visually connected through consistent artistic style. The transitions between each doll size are harmonious, with no visible seams or unnatural edges that break continuity or realism in terms of artistic representation. This smooth transition reinforces the cohesive aesthetic of the figurines.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of the Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table look balanced and natural, without any dolls appearing to float or overlap unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of the Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table in Image B is aligned evenly with appropriate spacing between each figure. There is no indication of any dolls floating or overlapping in a way that defies physical reality; each doll is firmly grounded on the table surface, maintaining a balanced and visually coherent arrangement.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the Russian nesting dolls and the wooden table consistent with the lighting in the original image, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B creates realistic shadows and highlights across the surface of the nesting dolls and on the table, which is indicative of natural room lighting conditions. This observation suggests that the overall lighting setup mirrors realistic illumination scenarios found indoors, preventing any appearance of unrealistic highlights or dark spots. Comparing with Image A, both images feature natural lighting; therefore, the consistency is well maintained in Image B.",
