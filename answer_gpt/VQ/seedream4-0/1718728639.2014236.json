      "question": "Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armor’s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tesserae on the chest and torso areas show a clear and consistent follow-through of the original armor’s curves. These mosaic tiles are precisely placed to match the contours of the chest and torso, exhibiting no visible breaks or misalignments. The sizes of the tesserae appear consistent, maintaining the aesthetic flow of the armor design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the left and right wings symmetrically styled with ornate feathers, and do they maintain natural layering and curvature without unnatural bends or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are designed with a high degree of symmetry, each side reflecting the other in both style and detail. The layering of feathers is natural and fluid, which maintains a consistent curvature. There are no noticeable unnatural bends or gaps that detract from their aesthetic and structural integrity.",

      "question": "Does the celestial dome background appear to surround the figure without visible edges, color bleeding, or inconsistencies in lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The celestial dome background in Image B seamlessly surrounds the figure, creating an immersive atmosphere. The mosaic tiles of the dome are cohesively placed, showing no visible edges or seams. The lighting is uniformly directed, enhancing the immersion and ensuring there is no color bleeding or inconsistency in the lighting across the dome.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mosaic patterns on the crown and neckpiece aligned with the original shape, symmetrically placed, and free of distorted or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic patterns on the crown and neckpiece are meticulously aligned with the original shapes. These patterns are symmetrically applied, retaining the crown and neckpiece’s intended geometric form without any distortions or missing sections, ensuring a balanced and harmonious appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the gold and azure colors used consistently across the armor, wings, and crown, with matching reflectivity and no abrupt transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold and azure colors are consistently applied across the armor, wings, and crown, maintaining a cohesive color scheme. The reflective quality of the tiles is uniformly matched, and transitions between these materials are smooth, indicating careful attention to maintaining color harmony and material consistency.",
