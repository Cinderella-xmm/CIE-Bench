      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the curls exhibit a thorough marble texture, capturing natural variations in depth and surface detail that is typical of marble sculptures. There are no signs of blurring or flattening, and the shading appears consistent across the entire hair area. This indicates a well-executed representation of marble sculpture hair curls.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders are aligned well with the anatomical structure, following the natural contours of musculature. They are depicted with continuous, coherent shapes and do not show gaps or misaligned edgesâ€”common flaws that could disrupt anatomical integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The angelic figures in the background of Image B have clear outlines and proper proportions. They are rendered with consistent depth, harmonizing well with the central figure. They do not appear flat, fragmented, or distorted, which might otherwise detract from the overall image quality.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette that emulates marble. The transitions between light and dark areas are smooth, without abrupt changes that might imply incomplete color conversion or artifacting, reflecting a consistent artistic execution of a marble impression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While examining the visible hand in Image B, it does not clearly show all fingers. Therefore, I cannot conclusively say whether both hands display exactly five fingers each or that the fingers are proportionally and anatomically correct across both hands since one hand is not visible.",
