      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist fully integrated into the image with smooth contours, consistent line weight, and no visible seams or misaligned textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the teddy bear dressed as a scientist. The bear's contours appear smooth, and the integration into the image has consistent line weight. There are no noticeable seams or misaligned textures, indicating that the teddy bear is well-integrated into the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lab equipment illustrations (e.g., beakers, test tubes) proportionally accurate, geometrically intact, and aligned with the hand-drawn chalk style without jagged edges or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lab equipment such as beakers and test tubes are drawn in a hand-drawn chalk style suitable for the backdrop of the green chalkboard. They maintain the proportions typically expected for these objects and show geometric integrity without jagged edges, fitting the illustrative theme of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all scientific symbols and doodles (such as planets, rockets, and formulas) have intact geometric forms, proper alignment, and no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scientific symbols and doodles in the edited image are well-proportioned and maintain the chalk style theme without artifacts. Their alignment is proper, and lines are placed as intended without overlap or misplacement, contributing to the overall coherence of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography (e.g., \"JOYFUL\", \"CURIOSITY\") clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the doodles, and free from blurring, stretching, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography on the chalkboard, including words like 'JOYFUL' and 'CURIOSITY,' is clear and legible. It is consistent with the hand-drawn doodle style seen throughout the image and shows no signs of blurring, stretching, or misalignment, ensuring readability and stylistic harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters (e.g., bear, rabbit) exhibit correct limb positioning, proportional body parts, and logical interaction with nearby objects without unnatural poses or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the bear and rabbit characters are positioned naturally within the scene. The teddy bear wears a lab coat, exhibiting proportional limb positioning that logically interacts with the doodles, suggesting a scientifically themed context. The bear's proportions are consistent, and no unnatural poses or deformations are visible.",
