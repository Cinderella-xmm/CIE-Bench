      "question": "Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a snow globe contains a miniature beach scene with a surfer figure, which is a creative representation. While it may not replicate the full structural elements of Image A, the setting within the globe has a sunset and beach context that visually connects with the original beach scene. The representation is designed to fit within the confines of a snow globe, maintaining a plausible visual consistency, with elements like sand and sunset captured well within the limitations of miniaturization.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a soft golden light and sparkles within the snow globe, enhancing the magical and warm ambiance akin to a sunset. These elements appear polished and creatively blend with the globe's scene, enhancing the aesthetic without visible digital artifacts, contributing to the cozy atmosphere created with the nearby fireplace.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style surfer figure and surfboard in the snow globe appear structurally intact and maintain the expected shapes for this style. The simplified and clean design of the figure, consistent with typical chibi proportions, ensures the elements are undistorted and logically represented within the confined space.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe is realistically placed on a wooden shelf near a fireplace, with proportionality appropriate to such a setting. The scale seems reasonable relative to the shelf, suggesting the scene is setup in a plausible manner typical of decorative placements within a cozy home environment.",
