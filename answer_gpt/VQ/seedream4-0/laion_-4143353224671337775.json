      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing the surface of the sculpture in Image B, the puzzle pieces are carefully shaped and joined, forming a continuous pattern without obvious gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges. This indicates a uniform arrangement of pieces which are neatly interlocked, reflecting a seamless design typical of a puzzle without assembler errors. The visual coherence and the smooth surface suggest the absence of irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle design seems to conform to the organic contours of the ceramic sculpture. The edges of the puzzle pieces are integrated with the shape and curvature of the sculpture's body, hugging its roundness and form. There are no noticeable sharp angles or flatness that deviate from the natural ceramic form, implying a design respecting the original shape's curvature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green puzzle piece atop the sculpture in Image B appears smooth and intact, without cracks or rough textures. Its surface is consistent, and although there is a color difference with the beige and brown pieces, it doesn't present noticeable contrast issues; the color variation seems intentional as part of the design. It is uniformly colored without disruption.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B is horizontally positioned on the white shelf, showing stable contact with the surface. The shadow cast beneath it is natural, following the shapeâ€™s contour and indicating proper grounding without floating or tilting effects. The perspective and alignment with the shelf support this stable presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features on the sculpture are integrated into the puzzle design but remain clear and proportionate. The eyes, mouth, and ears are discernible and maintain their form without signs of deformation or blurring, suggesting that the puzzle design carefully accommodates these features within the assembled pieces.",
