    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the stone-like texture applied to the mountain's surface exhibit uniformity and natural variation in roughness, without visible artifacts like repeating patterns or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the stone-like texture applied to the creature shows uniformity and a natural variation in roughness typical of natural stone surfaces. The texture appears consistent with the geological characteristics one would expect from a natural rock formation, exhibiting the randomness and irregularity found in nature without visible artifacts such as repeating patterns or abrupt transitions, indicating a realistic rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rock-carved eyes positioned symmetrically and proportionally on the mountain’s peak, with realistic depth and integration into the terrain, avoiding floating or misplaced features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the creature are positioned symmetrically, centered on the mountain's peak, maintaining proportionality and realistic depth. They are well integrated into the terrain, seamlessly blending with the stone texture of the creature, avoiding the impression of being floating or misplaced. The positioning reflects careful attention to anatomical structure relative to other features of the creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing-like ridges extend from the mountain’s sides in a way that follows natural geological lines and does not introduce sharp, broken, or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing-like ridges extend from the sides of the creature in a manner that mimics natural geological formations. The wings are organically integrated, following smooth, natural curves and lines without introducing sharp, broken, or impossible angles. Their design complements the overall aesthetic of the stone creature, mirroring natural processes of erosion and sediment deposition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the creature integrated with the tree silhouettes in a way that avoids visual conflicts such as overlapping branches appearing behind solid limbs or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the creature are integrated with the tree silhouettes so as to avoid visual conflicts. The solid limbs appear to originate seamlessly from the creature's structure and do not conflict visually with tree branches, with no overlapping or disconnected joints that might disrupt coherence. The integration of natural elements is maintained, preventing anything from appearing misplaced or unnaturally juxtaposed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminous veins emit a soft glow that blends with the blue and pink hues of the sky, without creating bright halos, sharp edges, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous veins appear to emit a soft glow that harmonizes well with the surrounding blue and pink hues of the sky. The glow is subtle and avoids creating bright halos or sharp edges that might detract from the natural ambiance. The realistic representation of soft illumination ensures that no areas appear overexposed, maintaining a cohesive integration with the environmental lighting conditions.",
