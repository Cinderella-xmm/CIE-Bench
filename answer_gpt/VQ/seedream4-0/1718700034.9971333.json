      "question": "Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of Image B shows the wings are made of crystal-like shards that are symmetrically aligned. The shards appear structurally coherent, with no visible gaps or misaligned facets. This gives the impression of a well-designed and cohesive wing structure. There are no signs of distorted geometry, which is typical in digital renderings of crystal-like structures. The symmetry preserves the elegance and desired aesthetic which suggests meticulous editing.",

      "question": "Do the golden leafy strands follow the natural flow of the original hair and appear integrated without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden leafy strands are positioned atop the hair and blend seamlessly with the natural contours of the hairstyle. They appear as an additional decorative element that complements the existing hair flow rather than contrasting or conflicting with it. The strands do not look disconnected or floating, demonstrating careful editing to ensure integration and visual harmony.",

      "question": "Does the shirt display a uniform, soft velvet texture with natural shadowing and no repeating patterns or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt in Image B is depicted with a velvet-like appearance where the texture is uniform and soft, typical of high-quality velvet fabric. The shadowing appears natural, aiding in creating depth without inconsistencies. There are no signs of repeating patterns or digital artifacts, indicating a smooth application of texture that maintains realistic garment integrity.",

      "question": "Is the background a consistent deep gray wall with no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or remnants of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a background that is a deep gray wall, an accurate depiction of a simple and consistent background. There are no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or signs of the previous scene, suggesting that the background transition was handled well with a focus on creating a neutral setting without distractions.",

      "question": "Are all edited elements—crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt—properly aligned with the body and each other, without clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited elements in Image B, including crystal wings, leafy hair adornment, and velvet shirt, are well aligned with the body and each other. There is no evidence of clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion. Each component is in its correct spatial context, supporting cohesive integration and maintaining proportionality with the body's natural form.",
