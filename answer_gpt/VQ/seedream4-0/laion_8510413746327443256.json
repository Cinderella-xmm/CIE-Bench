    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon eye is designed with careful attention to detail, featuring smooth gradients and consistent lighting that enhances its realistic appearance. The glow is natural and well-integrated into the design, suggesting a high-quality digital rendering. There are no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or glow artifacts, which confirms the image quality is well-maintained in these characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver scales around the band in Image B are intricately detailed and consistently aligned, providing a continuous geometric pattern that mimics realistic dragon scales. The shading is consistent, contributing to a natural metallic texture without any gaps or overlapping that would disturb the continuity of the design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing neural node on the watch case in Image B integrates seamlessly with the watch's structure. The illumination is consistent, maintaining a smooth and even glow that does not leak or distort the surrounding design. This integration highlights the precision of the visual effects used to maintain device coherence and aesthetic appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The control sigils depicted on the watch face in Image B maintain precise boundaries, showing well-defined shapes and consistent brightness. These elements are rendered without signs of blurring or ghosting, ensuring each sigil appears clear and retains its intended vibrance without sacrificing image quality.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, all components such as the case, band, crown, and side button are proportionally aligned. Each element adheres to a coherent structural design without any visible warping, stretching, or misplacement. The watch maintains a balanced and realistic appearance, upholding the integrity of its fantastical design within a believable framework.",
