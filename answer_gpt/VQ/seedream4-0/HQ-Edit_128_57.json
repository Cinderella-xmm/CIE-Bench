      "question": "Does the desk exhibit continuous, realistic embossed wood textures across its surface without visible seams, irregularities, or artificial-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk's surface has realistic wood grain textures which are continuous and detailed, representing high-quality craftsmanship. There are no visible seams or artificial-looking patterns; it presents a well-maintained antique appearance commonly found in vintage furniture. This assessment is based on common knowledge concerning wooden surfaces and the visual observation of the desk's intricate carved details which suggest authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the writing pad positioned flatly on the desk with uniform edges and natural aging effects such as slight discoloration and texture variation, without warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual inspection of Image B, the writing pad lays flat on the desk with straight, uniform edges. The paper exhibits signs of aging, such as discoloration and texture variation, both of which are common in vintage stationery without any visual distortion or irregular geometry. This perception is supported by the predictable characteristics of aged paper and the evenly distributed textures seen in the image.",

      "question": "Is the quill-shaped logo rendered with a raised, metallic gold finish that shows subtle highlights and shadows consistent with embossed foil, without smearing or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill-shaped logo appears as though it has a raised, metallic gold finish. The embossed look is pronounced with highlights and shadows that suggest realistic lighting interplay, typical of high-quality embellishments. There is no evidence of smearing or traits indicating unnatural sheen; the logo is consistent with premium embossed designs commonly found in elegant stationery sets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the ink bottle placed stably on the desk surface with proportional size and shape consistent with real glass bottles, and does the spine of the pad show clear, readable etched text without blurring or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ink bottle is depicted as stable with realistic size and dimensions that reflect real glass bottles. The proportions appear natural, indicating proper grounding on a flat surface. The text on the spine of the pad is clearly etched, readable, and presents without blurring or ghosting, as it would on a well-crafted item. This interpretation is due to the detailed presentation and clarity of labeling that fine stationery products often ensure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all modified elements (desk, pad, quill logo, ink bottle) proportionally aligned and spatially coherent, forming a unified vintage stationery package layout without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the elements including the desk, pad, quill logo, and ink bottle as harmoniously aligned and spatially coherent. The layout is proportionally accurate with each component, contributing to a unified vintage presentation; there are no floating or misaligned parts. This observation derives from the balanced positioning and visual symmetry expected in well-organized stationery arrangements which maintain aesthetic consistency.",
