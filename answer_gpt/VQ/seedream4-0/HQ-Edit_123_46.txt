    "Question": "Q1: Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines are thick and emphasize the comic style by outlining significant elements such as the player, basketball, hoop, and court. The lines are meant to exaggerate and create a sense of action. However, they should not cut into each element's form, but rather flow with the shapes, enhancing their definition for a comic effect. Upon close inspection, the outlines in Image B closely follow the contours of these elements, providing definition without overlap or cutting into the forms.",

They are typically positioned in a way that suggests movement or speed, often radiating from or trailing the moving objects. In this case, the lines accentuate the player's motion towards the hoop.
