      "question": "Are the reflections on the carsâ€™ surfaces clear and consistent with their surroundings without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflections on the cars' surfaces are created by the wet road, primarily reflecting red lights due to the traffic lights and other light sources. The surfaces of the cars appear smooth, with the reflections aligning well with the fact that they are under traffic lights. The reflections on the road mirror those of a typical wet environment, maintaining realism and consistency with the expected surroundings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the enhanced environmental haze create a realistic atmospheric depth without blurring or distorting the structural elements of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a realistic depiction of atmospheric haze with the tree line and distant objects gradually fading into the background. This creates depth without losing the integrity or clarity of the foreground elements like the cars and road markings. The haze effect aligns with typical such scenarios, where distant objects are less sharp due to atmospheric conditions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the increased contrast enhanced the visual impact without producing unnatural colors or excessive glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The contrast in Image B is enhanced to make the image look sharper, with the cars and their brake lights more prominent against the slightly subdued background. The colors remain natural, and there is no evidence of excessive glare or unrealistic color shifts that would detract from the image's real-world appearance. Everything remains within a natural range of hues and tones.",

      "question": "Does the movie poster style conversion maintain visual credibility with the traffic lights and road markings appearing undistorted and logically intact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the traffic lights and road markings remain correct and undistorted, aiding in maintaining the natural flow and logic of the scene. The conversion to a movie poster style enhances the dramatic feeling but respects the physical characteristics of these elements, ensuring that everything aligns properly and maintains credibility.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the cars, such as paint texture and taillight designs, been preserved without introducing unnatural artifacts or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the cars, including the paintwork and taillight designs, appear crisp and well-preserved. The textures are visible and realistic, with no signs of artifacting or degradation from over-processing. Everything feels naturally integrated into the scene, respecting the integrity of the objects.",
