    "Question": "Q1: Is the figure proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe such that her body parts (especially limbs and head) maintain natural anatomical alignment and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe. Her arms, torso, and head maintain a consistent size and alignment, suggesting the transformation into a 3D environment was done while preserving natural proportions. The posture of the figure is consistent with a sitting position, indicating that the transformation did not distort the anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle clearly visible and free from blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail after conversion to a 3D model?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle are rendered with high clarity. The vibrant colors and fine details, such as the geometric and dotted patterns on the dress and the texture of the braids, are crisp and free from artifacts, implying a successful conversion to a 3D model without loss of detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the wall patterns inside the globe accurately reflect the colors and shapes of the dress's pattern without warping, misalignment, or color deviation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall patterns inside the globe echo the colors and motifs found on the dress, though they feature general African-inspired patterns rather than a direct copy. There’s no noticeable warping, misalignment, or color deviation in the depicted globe's interior environment, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature roots beneath the figure arranged in a way that follows natural growth patterns and does not intersect or distort the figure’s legs or skirt?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the roots beneath the figure appear to be naturally arranged, with an organic spread that does not interfere with or distort the figure’s legs or skirt. This indicates the integration of the roots was executed with an understanding of natural growth patterns, maintaining the integrity of the figure's posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the miniature animals positioned at ground level with proper shadowing and scale relative to the figure, and do they have natural textures and forms without visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature animals are positioned at ground level around the base of the globe and appear to be in appropriate scale relative to the figure. They are depicted with natural textures and form, without visible artifacts, and are surrounded by realistic shadows, ensuring a cohesive miniature ecosystem.",
    "answer": "Yes"
