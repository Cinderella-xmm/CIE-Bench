    "Question": "Q2: Does the creature's design reflect the temple's shape and textures accurately, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distorted geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The creature, designed with elements of a traditional stepped pyramid temple, mirrors the architectural style of the temple. Its body seems to be a continuation of this structure, maintaining the geometric regularity and architectural motifs of the temple. The integration of appendages like claws does not appear to disrupt the temple's structural coherence, as they are blended into the same texture and style.",

    "explanation": "The creature's invented name and elemental type are presented in stylized text at the bottom of Image B. This information is arranged in a subtle, non-intrusive manner that complements rather than competes with the visual elements of the scene.
