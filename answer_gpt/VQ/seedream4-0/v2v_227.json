        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red motorcycle and blue truck are depicted in a simplified cartoonish style. The essential features such as the shape and basic design elements like the wheels, headlights, and general form are maintained. Common knowledge of cartoon adaptations indicates that essential features are kept for recognizability, and in this image, there are no unnatural textures or distortions present. Therefore, the simplified versions successfully maintain these key features without introducing any distortions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon style of Image B naturally includes exaggerated proportions and expressive features, such as large wheels and smiling faces. These elements enhance the playful nature of the image without reducing its visual credibility.

      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a thick white outline surrounds the sticker design, which is common in sticker illustrations to emphasize separation from the background. The outline is applied uniformly around the entire design and does not overlap or obscure the internal details of the motorcycle, truck, or rider, maintaining clarity throughout.",

      "question": "Does the use of a solid flat color for the circular base, with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it, achieve a dynamic effect without causing visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular base is depicted with a solid red color, providing contrast while allowing parts of the truck and motorcycle to extend beyond the circle. This approach results in a lively and dynamic effect consistent with cartoonish design choices. There are no visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details due to this design choice, maintaining a coherent and visually appealing presentation.",
