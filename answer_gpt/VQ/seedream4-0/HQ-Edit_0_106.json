      "question": "Does the lion’s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the lion is a solid black shape without internal details, suggesting the shape should be identifiable solely by its outline. The anatomical proportions appear correct as the lion is recognizable by key features, such as its mane, tail, and general body shape. The edges are smooth and lack visible pixelation or distortion, maintaining the silhouette's clarity and integrity.",

      "question": "Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a gradient transitioning from lighter to darker shades, predominantly in grayscale. The transition is smooth, without noticeable banding or harsh color boundaries, which results in a visually appealing and natural gradient. The use of grayscale ensures no unnatural color contrasts are introduced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground grass in Image B continues the silhouette theme, with the texture appearing as solid black. As it forms part of the overall silhouetted scene, the grass does not require intricate lighting since it's not depicted with natural colors or highlights. There are no repeating patterns or artificial sharpness, and it aligns with the composition, complementing the silhouette aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree silhouettes in Image B maintain a typical acacia tree shape, with flat-topped canopies and slender trunks. They appear structurally sound, with no visually unnatural angles or broken branches. These silhouettes balance well in the composition, contributing to the scene's overall harmony and thematic alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text is placed clearly above the lion silhouette, ensuring it doesn't interfere with or overlap the animal's head or body. The text is in a bold font, providing good contrast against the light background, thus making it legible and free from any distortion or noise. The positioning respects the visual space above the silhouette, maintaining the scene's balance.",
