      "question": "Do the transformed chalets maintain consistent roof slopes and chimney placements without geometric distortion or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases chalets that appear to have been transformed into ice structures. The roof slopes and chimney placements should remain stable and consistent to ensure architectural integrity. Visual inspection of Image B reveals that the chalets' roofs and chimneys are correctly positioned, suggesting no geometric distortion. The chalets maintain the original shape and consistency of traditional wooden buildings, albeit in an ice-transformed form. World knowledge of architectural designs helps validate these observations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing ice surface continuous across the slope and around the chalets without jagged edges, unnatural reflections, or inconsistent brightness patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape is transformed into an icy terrain with a glowing surface. The surface appears to smoothly transition across and around the chalets. Common understanding of natural ice formations and reflections suggests that a continuous glowing surface would not have jagged edges or unexpected brightness variations. Image B confirms the continuous and harmonious distribution of brightness, which aligns with natural icy textures.",

      "question": "Do the ice-enhanced pine trees retain recognizable tree silhouettes with evenly distributed icicles and no fused or missing branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B shows pine trees enhanced with ice. For the trees to retain their silhouette, ice formations should follow the branch structure without obscuring or altering overall shapes. The visual cues in Image B indicate the trees maintain their natural form, with icicles distributed evenly, allowing the tree shape to remain intact. This observation is based on an understanding of how ice might collect on natural surfaces without causing distortion.",

      "question": "Are the auroras positioned above the mountain range without overlapping the sun or creating unnatural light halos or disconnected streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features auroras in the sky, which need to be positioned naturally above the mountain range. A visual scan confirms the auroras are high in the sky, not disrupting other celestial elements like the sun. World knowledge of auroras informs that they typically appear in smooth, flowing patterns, which Image B correctly portrays without halos or disconnected streaks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snowflake patterns on the chalet walls uniform in scale and orientation, and do they align naturally with the building's architecture without repeating or distorting at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents chalets with snowflake decorations on their walls. An evaluation of these patterns should show uniformity and consistent orientation with the chalet's architectural lines. The snowflakes appear regularly sized and are naturally integrated into the chalet's architecture, demonstrating correct alignment without edge distortion. This is determined through understanding decorative motifs and design principles in built environments.",
