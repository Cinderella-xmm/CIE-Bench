      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the fortress walls and towers exhibit a uniform golden-brown cookie dough texture with darker edges that match the lighting direction and do not show unnatural pixelation or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is depicted as being crafted from golden-brown cookie dough with visible darker edges, which are in line with the expected shading given the lighting direction from the top left of the image. This color gradient is consistent throughout, providing a realistic appearance of shaded cookie dough without any signs of pixelation or unusual shading. The uniformity and smooth transitions indicate a well-crafted texture that aligns with the overall lighting of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls rendered as smooth, continuous streams of royal icing that follow the natural contour of the cliff and show appropriate sheen and thickness without appearing clumped or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B are illustrated as a flowing stream of royal icing. This icing smoothly contours the cliff shapes, maintaining a cohesive flow downwards. The consistency of thickness and sheen of the royal icing, as observed, reflects light appropriately without any broken or clumpy sections, indicative of smooth and deliberate rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees formed from green marzipan positioned naturally on the terrain, maintaining plausible size and shape without appearing compressed, misshapen, or disconnected from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are crafted from green marzipan shown planted naturally on the cookie landscape. Their size and shape appear consistent with expectations for miniature decorative trees; they exhibit a realistic positioning on the terrain without any indications of being compressed, misshapen, or unnaturally detached from the ground. The uniformity in their appearance supports the correct representation of the marzipan trees.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white ceramic platter clearly visible beneath the cookie fortress, extending outward with clean edges and casting a soft shadow that aligns with the light source, without appearing to float or distort the surrounding terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white ceramic platter in Image B is distinctly visible, providing a base for the cookie fortress. It extends outward with defined, clean edges. Based on the lighting direction from the top left, the shadow it casts appears soft and appropriate. The platter does not seem to float or distort, blending seamlessly with the ground while maintaining its own structure.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, texture discontinuities, or abrupt transitions between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees that suggest poor blending or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, the transitions between elements such as the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees are smooth and harmonious. There are no visible seams or abrupt changes in texture that would indicate rendering mistakes or poor blending. The cohesion among the different materials suggests a high level of detail in rendering.",
