      "question": "Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress are visible and appear to be well-defined and continuous. They show no indication of pixelation or jagged edges, which would suggest digital artifacts. The patterns look smooth and detailed against the fabric, indicating a high-resolution rendering. Thus, they appear as intended in digital design.",

      "question": "Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the line-drawn version of the temple is depicted with precise tier alignment and structural symmetry. The layers of the temple roof are drawn consistently, without any missing or distorted parts. The illustration retains a sense of balance, with each tier proportionally aligned, which reflects accurate and careful drawing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guardian statues flanking the pathway are mirrored versions of each other in terms of size, pose, and position relative to the central axis of the temple. This symmetry is typical in such designs to convey a harmonious balance and protect the temple. Their identical features support the intended temple aesthetics.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both of the dancerâ€™s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the dancer's hands with five fingers each, exhibiting natural spacing and smooth contours. There is no visible deformation or presence of extra digits. The fingers are illustrated with careful attention to proportionality and natural hand anatomy, supporting a realistic and visually appealing representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is positioned strategically to avoid overlap with key visual elements like the dancer, temple, and guardian statues. Each block of text is placed against the line-drawing background in its own space, ensuring readability and minimizing visual clutter. The placement seems well-planned to enhance the aesthetic without obstructing important images.",
