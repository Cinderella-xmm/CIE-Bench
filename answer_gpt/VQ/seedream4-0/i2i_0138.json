      "question": "Does the text 'Sharp' at the top left blend naturally into the image without causing any visible disruption to the scissors or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Sharp' is positioned on the top left area of the image. The text is placed on a plain dark background, which minimizes any visual interference. The style and positioning of the text ensure it does not overlap with or disrupt the visibility of the scissors in any way. The font and color contrast nicely with the background, allowing it to blend without being obtrusive.",

      "question": "Is the text 'Clean' at the bottom right rendered in a sketch style that matches the image's aesthetic, without introducing any artifacts or visual noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Clean' is positioned at the bottom right of Image B. It is rendered in a sketch style which complements the sophisticated and polished look of the scissors. There are no visible artifacts or visual noise introduced by this text. The typography style and placement maintain a harmonious appearance with the overall image aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the scissors preserved, with no apparent distortion in their shape caused by the placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean' does not overlap with the scissors and therefore does not distort or alter their proportions. The scissors' orientation and shape appear consistent and intact, similar to Image A, indicating that their proportions have been preserved despite the added elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the fine details, like reflections and edges of the scissors, remain sharp and unaffected by the presence of the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflections and edges of the scissors in Image B remain clear and sharp, suggestive of no negative impact from the text additions. The text is positioned away from areas where these fine details of the scissors are located, ensuring that these details remain unaffected and maintain their clarity, similar to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the positioning of the scissors and the added texts, appear balanced and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition is carefully balanced with the illustrated text 'Sharp' on the top left and 'Clean' on the bottom right, counterbalancing the prominent scissors centered in the image. This arrangement maintains visual harmony without any components appearing out of place or awkward. The composition is both plausible and aesthetically pleasing.",
