      "question": "Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold embellishments on the Dashiki present a level of integration that suggests realistic reflective properties. They are seamlessly combined with the fabric, without any indication of pixelation or floating edges. This suggests a careful attention to detail in terms of light and texture, providing a visually coherent result. Thus, the gold embellishments do appear to be naturally integrated.",

      "question": "Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays beads and symbols placed on the shoulders, appearing to align correctly with the character's shoulder anatomy. They have a realistic texture that resembles real beads, sitting naturally without signs of distortion or misalignment. The alignment and texture indicate careful editing to ensure a natural appearance in relation to the character's body.",

      "question": "Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Acacia trees exhibit a realistic appearance and proportional accuracy to what is expected of these trees in nature, with characteristic branching patterns typical of Acacia trees. There is no visible geometric distortion, and their presence in the landscape adds depth and coherence to the overall scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wild grass in Image B demonstrates a variety of heights, colors, and orientations. This variation adds to the natural appearance, avoiding any form of repetitive or tiled pattern that would suggest artificial editing. The grass appears to be randomly distributed, contributing to the realism of the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each, with natural joint alignment, skin texture, and shading that matches the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B each have five fingers with correct natural joint alignment. The skin texture and shading are consistent with the rest of the figure, indicating careful editing. The combination of these details results in a realistic representation of the hands, maintaining continuity with the rest of the image.",
