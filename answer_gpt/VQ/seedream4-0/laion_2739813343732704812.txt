    "Question": "Q1: Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is depicted as elongated and attached to the head naturally. The beak is straight and connects seamlessly to the head without any visible bends or breaks at the base. The cartoonish nature of the depiction maintains the structural integrity of the beak since it resembles a typical exaggerated style seen in animated or stylized designs. This is consistent with the visual cues concerning animal anatomy, even in a stylized form.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's feathers show a layered texture achieved through various pastel colors, creating overlapping sections that suggest depth and detail. The pastel coloring adds artistic flair, but the variance in shades, especially in the wings, indicate layering rather than uniform smoothness or pixelation. This stylized texture is typical in illustrative designs, maintaining both detail and aesthetic appeal.",
