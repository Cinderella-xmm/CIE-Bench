    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B is completely absent of any physical room elements such as walls, furniture, or windows. It is entirely covered by a smooth, uniform white surface without any shadows or lighting gradients, creating the effect of a non-existent physical space, typical of a digitally rendered or abstract scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
