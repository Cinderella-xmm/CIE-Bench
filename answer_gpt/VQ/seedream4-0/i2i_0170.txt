    "Question": "Q4: Is the texture of the cobblestone pavement represented naturally with soft gradients, maintaining the structural integrity and visual coherence without any loss of detail or unnatural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone pavement is depicted using a simplified and flat approach without detailed texture. While it lacks detailed intricacies compared to Image A, it maintains structural integrity and visual coherence in line with the illustrative style, appearing natural within the context of the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the lighting effects and shadows in the image convincingly portrayed with soft gradient blocks, ensuring they contribute to the overall realism and natural appearance without breaking the visual flow?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a shift to an illustrative style that doesn't utilize gradients for shadows or lighting effects. It opts for a flat color representation which, although different from the photo-realistic lighting of Image A, does not break visual flow due to its consistent art style. The overall appearance remains cohesive and appropriate for the illustration format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
