      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO representation of the avocado half in Image B uses rectangular and square LEGO bricks to form the curved shape of an avocado. LEGO, due to its nature, often results in a blocky appearance when representing curves. In this case, the avocado's edge will have a somewhat pixelated appearance due to the rectangular nature of LEGO bricks. Therefore, maintaining a perfectly smooth and curved appearance as in a real avocado is challenging and often not achieved. Thus, the bricks cause a jagged and geometric outline instead of a smooth curve.",

      "question": "Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGOs representing the blueberries and raspberries use round-shaped LEGO pieces, likely 1x1 round plates, or similar elements. These are often limited in their ability to completely capture spherical forms without a bit of blockiness, but they serve to individually distinguish each fruit piece. However, when viewed from above, they appear unified and adequately individual due to the inherent shape of specific LEGO pieces that allow round forms to be represented accurately without substantial flattening or irregular joining.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO broccoli in Image B attempts to mimic the layered structure and the branching of a real broccoli through the use of green LEGO pieces that would ideally approximate tree-like forms. These pieces are likely composed of individual rounded bricks or small assemblies that can give an impression of depth and layering akin to broccoli florets. While LEGO's geometric limitations impose a certain simplification of actual botanical complexity, the representation includes distinction in the topography, making it recognizable as broccoli.",

      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bell pepper is arranged using red bricks which, by LEGO design, lead to a more angular result than real-world curves. While builders can construct smooth-looking surfaces by carefully placing bricks and plates, achieving a perfectly smooth and curve-like real pepper is difficult due to the modular and angular nature of LEGO. There might not be actual gaps, but the angular transitions would still be visible due to the brick shapes.",

      "question": "Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped board is constructed with LEGO bricks. Given the nature of square and rectangular LEGO bricks, replicating a perfect heart shape as seen in organic or precisely cut materials like the original wooden board is challenging. The resulting shape is likely more angular, with visible steps along the contours due to the stacked rows of bricks, leading to a pixelated appearance rather than a smooth curve.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the asparagus stalks are represented using green LEGO bricks, which are aligned in a parallel formation to suggest a bundle. These stalks are visually bound by tan or beige colored LEGO pieces that mimic twine or string. This binding element likely preserves the overall look of the bundle, keeping a consistent recognition factor for the represented vegetable.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a gray base, typically consistent with LEGO setups. The base's representation maintains uniformity without apparent texture in LEGO pieces, and no visible signs of lighting contrast that would imply mismatched compositing or shadow inconsistencies. LEGO displays generally have a flat appearance unless specifically designed for shadowing, which seems not to be the case here.",
