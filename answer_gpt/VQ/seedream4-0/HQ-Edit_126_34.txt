    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the cabin’s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the cabin are shaped through broad and varied brushstrokes in a painterly style. Despite this artistic approach, the structure maintains recognizable geometric consistency—walls and windows appear as vertical rectangles and parallel lines, fitting an expected cabin form. The roof follows a triangular shape that aligns with the visual representation typical for cabins. Thus, while the edges may not be sharply defined due to the impressionistic style, they remain identifiable within the overall composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fir trees display a vertical orientation with layered foliage suggested through horizontal brushstrokes that create a feathered effect. This artistic technique can simulate the natural layering of pine needles and branches. By maintaining vertical lines and implied foliage, the image communicates the typical structure of fir trees prevalent in winter landscapes. When compared to Image A, where trees have a more defined and realistic sharpness, Image B successfully provides a painted impression while preserving the expected tree form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates smoke emanating from the chimney by using elongated brushstrokes from the chimney upward, continuing vertically. The smoke has a soft, wispy quality, suggesting it blends into the sky, thus portraying the natural dispersion clouds make in cold air. Compared to Image A, where the smoke is depicted sharply and distinctly, Image B uses artistic techniques to suggest movement and diffusion, consistent with an impressionistic portrayal of smoke behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow is represented with varying brush textures across different surfaces, including the roof and ground, and tree branches are covered with light colors indicating snowfall coverage. This painterly depiction showcases an impression where snow appears uniformly spread across these areas, providing the illusion of natural accumulation. Although the brushwork adds artistic texture, the distribution mimics how snow naturally settles in a landscape. Image A displays photographic realism, showing distinct snow coverage; Image B mirrors this through artful expression.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows and string lights are painted with warm, glowing colors that blend into the surrounding hues. This soft blending characteristic of like brushwork maintains the consistency of the impressionistic style, lacking harsh outlines or distinct halos. The image achieves a balance between illumination and artistic integrity. While Image A shows clear lighting effects with strong contrast, Image B opts for a cohesive aesthetic that integrates these elements smoothly into the winter scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground elements like small trees and the fence are depicted with slightly larger and more detailed brushstrokes, providing a sense of proximity. Their color saturation and placement guide the perception of depth by contrasting with the softer, more diminutive representation of the midground cabin and further blurred background trees. This technique mirrors spatial logic found in compositions, where foreground detail enhances depth perception. Compared to Image A, which uses clear depth cues and gradient focus, Image B successfully preserves spatial hierarchy through painterly depth cues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
