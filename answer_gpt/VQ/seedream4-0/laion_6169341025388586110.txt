    "Question": "Q1: Does the statue exhibit a consistent clay-like texture across all body parts, including the face, limbs, and torso, without visible patches of mismatched material or unnatural graininess?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the statue with a clay-like texture that appears uniform across all visible parts of the body, including limbs and torso. The surface reflects a consistent material appearance with no visible inconsistencies or patchiness. World knowledge informs that clay sculptures should present a smooth, even texture when well-crafted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome fully transparent with no visible distortion of the statue's shape or features behind it, and does it display natural reflections and refractions consistent with real glass?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears transparent without distorting the statue within. It displays reflections and refractions typical of real glass as evidenced by the subtle reflections and clarity of the material, aligning with worldly understanding of glass properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome evenly spaced, clearly defined, and integrated smoothly into the surface without overlapping or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The patterns on the glass dome in Image B are clearly defined, appearing evenly spaced and integrated smoothly without any signs of overlapping or jagged edges, which corresponds with the expected craftsmanship of decorative glasswork according to world knowledge.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights under the spotlight without visible halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trident, snake, and drum are shown with enhanced golden highlights that are luminous under the spotlight yet free from halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposure, suggesting an advanced understanding of lighting techniques and material rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the muscle contours on the statueâ€™s arms, chest, and legs accurately shaded with smooth gradients that follow the underlying anatomy and directional light source?",
    "explanation": "The shading on the statue in Image B seems to accurately follow the anatomical contours and the direction of the light source, with smooth gradients enhancing the muscle definition on the arms, chest, and legs, consistent with principles of realistic sculpture rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the incense holders positioned at ground level around the base of the pedestal, correctly scaled, and free from floating or clipping against other structures?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays incense holders positioned around the base of the pedestal. These are correctly scaled and remain free from any floating or clipping against other structures, which ensures a realistic integration of objects in the scene based on spatial consistency and scale standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
