    "Question": "Q1: Does the mango retain its recognizable shape and texture in the 8-bit pixel art style without appearing overly distorted or unnatural?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is depicted in an 8-bit pixel art style, which naturally reduces detail and smoothness due to the blocky style. Despite this, the mango's general shape is well-retained, staying true to the oval shape typical of a mango. The texture is simplified but not to the extent that it becomes unrecognizable or distorted. The pixelation is consistent with the style and doesn't impair recognition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the table and napkin depicted with consistent structure and proportions in the 8-bit pixel art style, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or disproportionate elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the table and napkin retain their geometric integrity despite the pixelated style. The table's plane is portrayed consistently, with the expected rectangular shape and straight lines that define its surface. The napkin, although simplified, maintains its approximate shape and proportion relative to the mango and table, with no apparent broken or disproportionate elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the fine details of the mango's surface and the napkin's texture remain discernible in the 8-bit pixel art style, without significant loss or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
    "explanation": "In the 8-bit pixel art style of Image B, many fine details are naturally lost because of the simplification typical to pixel art. While the mango's general shape is preserved, the fine surface details like subtle color variations and texture are not discernible due to pixelation, and the texture of the napkin is simplified as well. This simplification means that some details are lost, and the pixelated style by itself can introduce blocky and unnatural patterns due to the nature of pixel art.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the lighting and shadow effects on the mango and table in the 8-bit pixel art style appear natural and plausible, without introducing any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and lighting are represented in broader, less detailed blocks typical of pixel art. Despite the simplification, the direction and general dispersion of light and shadow are consistent with common lighting from the side. The shadows are blocky, but they follow a logical pattern and do not introduce any glaring artifacts or inconsistencies, maintaining a degree of natural appearance within the constraints of 8-bit art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the composition and layout of the mango, napkin, and table in the 8-bit pixel art style visually credible and structurally sound, without any elements appearing misplaced or out of context?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of the mango, napkin, and table remains true to its original setup. The spatial arrangement and proportions are logical, with the mango centered on the napkin and the napkin placed on the table. Even in a pixelated style, the components are contextually placed and structurally sound, providing a credible still-life representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
