    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature proportionally scaled with rounded, simplified features that maintain their identifiable characteristics without distorted limbs or facial structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi versions of Ultraman and the creature are depicted with stylized, rounded features. Ultraman's body proportions are smaller and more compact than the typical proportions of a full-size Ultraman, with a large head and limbs that give a cute and exaggerated appearance. The creature also exhibits similar chibi characteristics with a simplified facial structure and limb shapes. Despite this stylization, both characters accurately maintain their recognizable traits without any awkward distortions to the limbs or faces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the chibi figures exhibit a consistent, smooth, glossy finish without visible texture breaks, uneven highlights, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B closely, the surfaces of both the chibi Ultraman and the creature are smooth and exhibit a glossy finish. The highlights on their surfaces appear consistent with the light source, with even reflections that enhance their toy-like appearance. There are no visible breaks in texture or any reflections that seem unnatural, ensuring a cohesive visual style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering dust particles evenly distributed in the air around the chibi figures, forming a soft, swirling motion that blends naturally with the background mist without clumping or artificial trails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glittering dust particles around the chibi figures appear to be distributed evenly, contributing to an aesthetic that suggests motion and dimension. The particles combine with the background mist in a way that looks organic, with no noticeable clumping or trails that could disrupt the natural blend between the different visual elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the outer globe clearly defined with a transparent spherical shape that contains all internal elements, and do the etched cosmic patterns on its surface appear correctly aligned and non-distorted across the curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer globe in Image B is distinctly visible as a transparent sphere enclosing the chibi figures. The cosmic patterns etched on the globe's surface are aligned appropriately and appear to wrap smoothly around the globe. There is no visible distortion, ensuring that the natural curvature of the sphere is maintained. This helps reinforce the impression that the entire scene is encapsulated within the globe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base feature detailed metallic debris and rugged terrain that support the scene's scale and contrast with the chibi figures, without floating or misplaced objects or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is crafted to resemble rugged terrain with scattered metallic debris, offering a fitting contrast to the smooth, glossy chibi figures. The metallic pieces and rocky textures align with the base, with no objects appearing to float inexplicably or be out of place. The lighting is consistent across the base, helping to reinforce the scene's cohesive scale and grounding the characters effectively.",
