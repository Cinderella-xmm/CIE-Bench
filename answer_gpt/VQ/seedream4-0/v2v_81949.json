      "question": "Does the transformation into a comic book style maintain the natural appearance of the chimney sweep and his equipment without introducing unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into a comic book style involves bold outlines and halftone shading, which are common techniques used to create dramatic and stylized appearances. The chimney sweep's features and equipment, such as the brush and rope, are clearly defined and do not exhibit any unnatural textures or artifacts that would detract from the overall style. The comic book style focuses on exaggeration and simplicity, and Image B successfully maintains these characteristics without compromising the visual integrity of the chimney sweep and his equipment.",

Additionally, the cityscape enhances the depth and context of the image without causing any direct conflict or disruption of visual credibility.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow circle serves as a significant background element that highlights the chimney sweep. It creates a dramatic contrast with the other elements in the image.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of bold outlines and halftone shading is typical in comic book art for creating contrast and visual interest. Image B employs these techniques effectively, ensuring that the structural elements of the chimney sweep, the chimney, and the background maintain their consistency. The halftone patterns add depth without obscuring essential details, preserving the overall readability and integrity of the image. The lines and shading complement each other to form a unified comic style.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The caption 'Just another day cleaning city's lungs' is placed strategically at the bottom of Image B. The typeface and placement are consistent with the comic book theme and do not introduce clutter. The bold presentation of the text complements the image's stylistic choices, integrating seamlessly into the design. The caption adds narrative context that aligns with the visual story being told, without disrupting the flow of the image.",
