      "question": "Are the body proportions and anatomical features of the person in 3D cartoon style coherent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is depicted in a 3D cartoon style. Cartoon styles often exaggerate or stylize body proportions for artistic effect, but coherence is maintained so that the characters look naturally intended within their style. The person in Image B has proportions typical of a cartoon character with a simplified form and slightly exaggerated head size, which is a common trait in animation, indicating coherent body proportions for this style.",

      "question": "Does the spinning metal shield have a natural metallic texture and motion blur indicating realistic spinning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield in Image B is depicted with a metallic texture that catches light and incorporates highlights and reflections typical of metal surfaces. The presence of motion blur around the shield indicates its fast spinning motion, which is a technique used to suggest movement realistically and dynamically.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the person and the new sci-fi training ground background seamless, with consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person standing on the block and the sci-fi training ground background both exhibit consistent lighting and shadows, which help to integrate the character into the environment. The lighting reflects off surfaces in harmony, contributing to a seamless transition between the character and the background.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands of the person in 3D cartoon style have a natural number of fingers with shapes and lines conforming to cartoon ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In 3D cartoon styles, characters often feature simplified anatomy, including hands with fewer fingers. The hands in Image B appear to have an appropriate number of fingers (usually four in cartoons) and follow the general ergonomic curves and proportions found in stylized characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the color, lighting, and perspective of the 3D cartoon person harmonize with the sci-fi training ground background, contributing to a visually credible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of Image B is consistent between the character and the background, utilizing neon lights and reflective surfaces to create a cohesive atmosphere. The lighting matches across the scene, and the perspective accurately aligns with the environment, contributing to a unified and credible visual.",
