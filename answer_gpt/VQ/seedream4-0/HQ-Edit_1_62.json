      "question": "Is the enlarged hat proportionally consistent with the man's head size and does it retain natural texture and edge definition without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enlarged hat appears proportionate in relation to the size of the man's head, maintaining a natural look. The texture of the hat is consistent with that of woven fabric, and the edges are well-defined without noticeable geometric distortion. Common sense tells us that a well-fitted hat should align naturally with the head size, and Image B supports this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the vest clearly defined, aligned with the fabric texture, and free from jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embroidered patterns on the vest are precise and aligned with the fabric texture, indicating that care was taken to maintain clarity and alignment. The patterns do not show signs of jagged edges, and the colors are distinct without bleeding into the surrounding areas. This suggests that the editing was done with attention to detail, typical of well-crafted embroidery in traditional garments.",

      "question": "Do the exaggerated shoe laces maintain a logical attachment to the shoe and show consistent shading and texture without appearing detached or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exaggerated shoe laces in Image B maintain a logical connection to the shoes, with consistent shading and texture that reflects typical characteristics of lace attachment to footwear. The laces do not appear detached or distorted, but rather seamlessly integrate with the rest of the shoe, indicating careful editing to preserve a realistic appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the manâ€™s face and body maintain anatomical consistency, with correctly positioned features and no visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ignoring the blurred face, the man's body in Image B shows anatomical consistency with the features correctly positioned without visible warping or stretching. His posture and proportions reflect realistic human anatomy despite the artistic style, with clothing fitting naturally around the body. This adherence to anatomical norms supports the perception of balance and natural stance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the man and the illustrated background smooth, with consistent lighting and perspective across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the man and the illustrated background is smooth, featuring consistent lighting and perspective between the foreground and backdrop. The use of shadows and lighting complements the overall scene, creating a cohesive illustration that blends the character naturally with the setting. Common artistic techniques ensure that the subject appears integrated within the landscape, reflecting harmony in the composition.",
