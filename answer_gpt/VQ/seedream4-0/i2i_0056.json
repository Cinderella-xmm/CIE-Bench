      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D cartoon character stand naturally at the center of the image without visible distortions in its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style cartoon character is positioned centrally within the frame, showcasing a harmonious balance in proportions. This illustration style typically features exaggerated facial features and a smaller body, characteristics prominently displayed in this image. These attributes are expected within chibi character design, aligning with the cartoon representation without any noticeable distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and materials of the chibi character's hard hat, shirt, and vest consistent with the original imageâ€™s description and appear natural in the 3D environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character is depicted wearing a yellow hard hat, yellow shirt, and an orange safety vest. These colors correspond to typical construction worker attire, with the hard hat and safety vest accurately representing the standard safety colors. The materials, while simplified in a cartoon style, appear natural and appropriate for the 3D environment, maintaining consistency with construction-themed aesthetics.",

      "question": "Does the transition between the chibi character and the low-poly construction scene lack noticeable artifacts and unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B effectively integrates the chibi character into the low-poly construction scene. The textures and transition between the character and the environment are smooth and cohesive, without any visible artifacts or discordant elements. The uniform style and texture of low-poly models maintain the aesthetic integrity, resulting in a natural blending between foreground and background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background in the edited image a simplified light gray plane with a small crane model, and is it devoid of elements from the original beach scenery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of a light gray plane creating a minimalist construction scene with a small crane model positioned behind the chibi character. This setup is markedly different from Image A, which features a beach landscape with a horse and distant buildings. The edited image lacks any elements from the original beach scenery, focusing instead on construction-themed elements.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a 1:1 composition ratio with the chibi character properly centered and proportionate within the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a square composition, often indicative of a 1:1 aspect ratio, with the chibi character centrally positioned. The proportions and arrangement within the frame seem balanced, highlighting the character without crowding or uneven spacing, therefore indicating well-maintained composition and proportion.",
