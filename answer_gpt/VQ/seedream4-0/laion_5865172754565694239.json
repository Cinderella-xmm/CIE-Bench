      "question": "Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are positioned on the frame near the handlebars, displaying a consistent color with the rest of the red frame. There are no visible seams, texture mismatches, or color artifacts, indicating a seamless integration. This analysis is based on observing the continuity of color and texture in the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows cartoon limbs that appear to extend from the hub centers. Upon inspecting the regions surrounding the rims, spokes, and hubs, it's apparent that these elements maintain their original shapes and are not distorted by the addition of the cartoon limbs. This conclusion is drawn from observing the symmetry and integrity of these structural components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, motion lines are added to suggest movement. They are positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, which helps convey speed. Observing carefully, these lines do not interfere or overlap with the chain, derailleur, or the “DUCATI” logo, ensuring clarity and focus on the text branding. This judgment stems from looking for overlaps and ensuring the integrity of the bike's essential components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frame in Image B, although with added cartoon elements, does show a consistent tubular structure similar to standard bicycle frames. It maintains its dimensional consistency and shape without noticeable deformities such as bulges or collapses. The addition of the hero suit design does not affect the smooth straight lines characteristic of a tubular bike frame, verified by comparing general bicycle geometries.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sound effect texts ‘Vroom!’ and ‘Zoom!’ are placed externally relative to the main components of the bike, effectively suggesting motion and dynamics. These texts do not interfere or obscure the “DUCATI” branding or control levers, indicating a thoughtful placement that maintains both aesthetic and brand visibility. By ensuring they remain outside the main structure, movement is accentuated without visually blocking important bike parts.",
