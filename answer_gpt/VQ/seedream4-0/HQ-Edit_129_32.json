      "question": "Does the velvet lining inside the box display a soft, matte texture with subtle pile variation and appropriate shadowing beneath the key, indicating realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet lining in Image B is visible as the background where the key is placed. It shows a soft, matte texture typical of velvet, with subtle variations in the nap or pile of the fabric. The shadowing beneath the key indicates the three-dimensional nature of the fabric and contributes to realism by acknowledging the weight and presence of the key resting upon it, creating areas where light and shadow naturally occur.",
