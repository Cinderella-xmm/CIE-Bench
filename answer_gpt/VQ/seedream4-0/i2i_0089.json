      "question": "Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten is depicted jumping out of a screen, which successfully maintains a structurally consistent and natural body form. The proportions between the head, body, and limbs appear appropriate and match a natural movement pose often seen in cats. The smoothness of the lines and transition between body parts show no distortions that would interrupt the realism expected in a frame of digital art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fur details around the kitten’s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fur on the kitten's face in Image B retains detailed and fine textures that one would typically expect in digital renderings of cats. The textures mimic the layering and fine lines characteristic of natural feline fur without appearing blurred or overly smoothed, indicating a preservation of quality detail in the rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten gives the effect of jumping out of a screen, a classic 3D illusion effect. This is achieved without distorting the animal’s anatomical proportions, as can be seen by the consistent size of the head relative to the body and the alignment of the limbs, maintaining a plausible and coherent 3D representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue blanket surrounding the kitten does support the 3D illusion effectively. The material is rendered with realistic textures and shadows, giving it depth and inserting a sense of realism that avoids the presence of artificial seams or visual artifacts that could break the immersion or feel inconsistent with real-world textiles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitten’s paws in Image B are shaped in a manner that is consistent with natural cat physiology. They show proper articulation and are placed in a believable position relative to the kitten's leap. This demonstrates that the 3D effect was applied without warping the appendages in a way that would appear unrealistic or improperly aligned.",
