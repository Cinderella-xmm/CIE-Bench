      "question": "Does the African savanna at night blend seamlessly with the existing train and tracks, without any unnatural edges or contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the African savanna at night seems to be well-integrated with the train and tracks. There is no visible harsh line or contrast between the train, tracks, and the background indicating good blending. The foreground and background elements appear consistent, which contributes to a seamless look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stars and the Milky Way depicted naturally, without any artificial or pixelated textures disrupting their appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stars and the Milky Way in Image B appear to be clear and detailed, providing a natural look. There are no obvious pixelated textures or artificial disruptions visible, which suggests a high-quality integration of the night sky into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks correspond logically to the new nighttime savanna setting, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, even though it is edited to appear as a nighttime scene, the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks do not seem to fully correspond to a night setting. They lack the expected low-light contrast and soft shadowing that typically reflect a nighttime environment, causing some incoherence in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the train relative to the vastness of the African savanna and the starry sky proportionally correct and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B is sized in a manner consistent with the perspective of the scene and its surroundings. The vastness of the savanna and the expansive sky do not appear to dwarf or misrepresent the train's size. The proportions work well together to maintain a realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the train been preserved without degradation or introduction of unnatural textures during the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details on the train in Image B, including its surface textures and details like the number or logos, remain intact and do not appear degraded. There are no additional unnatural textures introduced due to editing, keeping the train's appearance consistent with its pre-edit state.",
