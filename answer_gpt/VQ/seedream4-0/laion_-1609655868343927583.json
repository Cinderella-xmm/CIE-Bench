    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the gemstone inlays embedded into the crown surface without visible gaps or floating elements, and does the crown retain the original curvature of the marble top?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown is decorated with gemstone inlays that appear to be set into the crown without visible gaps, showing careful attention to detail. This indicates a seamless integration. Regarding the curvature, the crown is designed in a circular fashion rather than retaining the semi-circular marble top shape of Image A, suggesting a different curvature than the original. The analysis combines visual inspection of fitting details in Image B with knowledge of typical crown structures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the robe follow the original cabinet’s curved sides and tapering shape, and do the fabric folds and patterns flow naturally without sharp breaks or artificial lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe adapts to the cabinet's curved sides, spreading naturally over it without significant breaks or awkward lines. The fabric patterns and folds harmonize with the cabinet's curves, showing attention to natural flow. Comparing with Image A's rounded structure, the edited robe maintains the continuity of the furniture's contours, suggesting careful integration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the drawer engravings positioned at the waistline as belt buckles, aligned with the robe’s structure, and connected with visible straps or fastenings that appear physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows drawer engravings positioned at the waistline, designed as belt buckles over the robe. The use of visible straps shows a plausible attachment method, aligned with the robe's structure. As the second image demonstrates a realistic arrangement for these engravings, it integrates the physical aspects effectively. Image A shows conventional drawer arrangement, which forms the basis for this transformed arrangement in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clawed feet maintain the original leg length and thickness, and are the claws proportionally sized and fully touching the ground without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clawed feet are attached to the cabinet, maintaining a proportional size similar to typical animal claws and extending down to the ground, appearing well-aligned with no detachment issues visible. Considering Image A's leg design, the edited feet appear slightly larger and more elaborate than the cabinet's original. This discrepancy indicates a departure from the original cabinet leg's simplicity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the drawer openings transformed into pouches with visible flap closures and stitching, and do they hang from the robe with realistic weight and attachment points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the drawer openings in their original form, without transformation into pouches with flap closures or stitching. There is a belt bag visible hanging from the robe, but it doesn't transform the drawer details into pouches. This indicates that while some accessories are added, the drawer structure itself is unchanged in Image B. Image A's drawers simply open without additional transformation.",
