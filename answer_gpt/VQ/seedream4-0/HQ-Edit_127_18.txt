    "Question": "Q1: Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
    "explanation": "The vintage travel case in Image B is crafted to look like a miniature diorama. The boundaries of the case are clearly defined by the case's edges and latches. The lighting within the diorama seems consistent, aligning the elements inside with a coherent perspective and light source, creating a seamless integration. There are no jarring shifts in perspective or lighting that conflict between the case and its contents.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the resin grass within the travel case features variety and texture, with visible individual blades showing slight variations in length and angle typical of natural grass. The shadows cast appear soft and consistent with the presumed light source, which would align with a single overhead illumination as indicated by the overall lighting of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "The acacia tree in the diorama is both smaller than the elephant and set at a distance behind it. This size discrepancy and placement effectively create the illusion of a larger scale, consistent within the miniature setting, and enhances the diorama's realistic portrayal of an outdoor scene despite being within the constraints of the case.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are clearly painted on the inner surface of the lid. There are no indications of specular highlights or depth inconsistencies, as they maintain a flat painted appearance consistent with a mural style, integrating well with the visual style of the diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
    "explanation": "The brass compass rests on a flat surface outside the suitcase in Image B. The compass casts a shadow and may show subtle reflections, all in alignment with the main light source, respecting the texture and angles of the dioramaâ€™s established lighting. The reflections and shadows are consistent with the lighting direction from above.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant maintains a natural skin texture with visible detailing. The proportions of the limbs and the curvature of the tusks appear correct, free from distortion. There is no visible pixelation, indicating clear and well-detailed rendering within the diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
    "explanation": "Within Image B, all elements in the diorama, including the elephant, the tree, and the grass, seem to cast shadows in a consistent direction, likely indicating a single overhead light source. The softness of the shadows is similar across these elements, which supports the coherence in lighting throughout the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
