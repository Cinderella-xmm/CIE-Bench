    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is rendered with a translucent pink glass-like material. The body indeed displays subtle bubble textures consistent with such a material, suggesting an intended glass representation. There is no evidence of jagged or inconsistent textures, indicating that the glass appearance is smooth and uniformly applied.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the yellow belly of the seahorse appears smooth and exhibits the characteristics of an opaque glass. The music note inside a heart is sharply etched, and the edges of the symbol are clean and crisp, with no evidence of blurring or deformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ribbons on the head and fins appear to be made of solid lavender glass. These ribbons have smooth surfaces and show reflections characteristic of glass materials. They retain their intended shape, without any visible warping, stretching, or flattening effects.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seahorse in Image B is positioned on a flat, reflective black surface. The reflections of the base and lower body of the seahorse are clear and mirror-like. The stand appears seamless, with no visible gaps, ensuring that it is well-integrated and not floating.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements of the seahorse—including the body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—are consistent in terms of lighting, shadows, and material properties. There are no mismatches in highlights or color shifts, nor are there artificial edges that would indicate poor blending. The visual consistency suggests a well-executed transformation into a glass-like representation.",
