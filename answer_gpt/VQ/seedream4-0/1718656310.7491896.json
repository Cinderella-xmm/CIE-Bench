      "question": "Do the stained glass wings feature consistent, smooth patterns without jagged edges or pixelated textures, and do they appear to transmit light naturally as if made of glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are detailed with stained glass designs featuring floral and leaf patterns reminiscent of Tiffany-style glass. The consistent lines, smoothness of the pattern, and the way light appears to filter through naturally suggest the characteristics of real stained glass. There are no visible jagged edges or pixelation, supporting the conclusion that the patterns are smooth and consistent, and the light transmission effect is convincingly glass-like.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mushrooms emit a soft glow, interacting realistically with the surrounding elements through shadow and light reflex.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are positioned with clearly visible fingers, displaying natural alignment and a smooth skin texture.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seated posture in Image B shows the character's legs crossed neatly.
