      "question": "Does the tallest tower on the left retain its original vertical structure and proportional height after being modified with robotic limb features, without any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower on the left appears to have maintained its vertical structure and proportional height despite the addition of robotic limb features. The visual analysis shows that the tower is not stretched or compressed; it retains a natural tower shape without broken edges or distortion. By combining the observations with world knowledge about architectural editing techniques, the tower's modification with robotic elements does not negatively impact its original form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers smoothly integrated into the facade without visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon circuitry patterns shown in Image B appear smoothly integrated into the facades of the EMAAR building and nearby towers. These patterns are consistent in color and spacing, suggesting careful editing to avoid breaks and unevenness. The visual cues indicate a fluid integration, as observed by the regularity and harmony in the patterns, aligning with common expectations of digital enhancements.",

      "question": "Do the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior, with no repeating patterns or distorted shapes suggesting low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scale-like panels on the dark glass towers in Image B exhibit uniform texture and consistent reflection behavior. The panels are evenly spaced, with no observable repeating patterns or distorted shapes. The visual consistency indicates high-quality rendering, reflecting natural architectural design and digital enhancement standards.",

      "question": "Do the glowing expressway spines maintain realistic width and curvature throughout their length, connecting logically to surrounding roads and showing no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the glowing expressway spines with realistic width and curvature, smoothly connecting to the surrounding roads and urban infrastructure. The flow of these spines appears natural, without floating or disconnected segments, supported by the seamless integration into the urban landscape observed in the visual cues.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately, without appearing detached or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings in Image B are aligned properly with the rooflines and appear appropriately scaled. The alignment and scale reflect a stable and intentional modification, supported by the structured integration observed from the visual perspective.",

      "question": "Are the holographic eye-like elements located on top of major towers clearly defined with smooth light emission and no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic eye-like elements atop major towers are clearly defined. The light emission appears smooth and consistent, free from digital artifacts like aliasing or double images. Visual analysis shows these elements are distinctly visible, and the enhancement aligns with expectations of high-quality digital modifications.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details in Image B are sharp and legible, with no visible blurring or degradation. Visual cues suggest the editing process maintained clarity and definition, aligning with standards in architectural photography and editing.",
