    "Question": "Q2: Is the style and material of the handwritten word 'Draft' visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?",
    "explanation": "The word 'Draft' is written in a style that suggests it was made with the pencil in the image, which matches the typical look of pencil marks: slightly grainy and varying in thickness. This visual consistency aligns with common sketch or draft practices, reinforcing the credibility of the writing tool used being the pencil.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the edges of the handwritten word 'Draft' sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The sharpness of edges in Image B can be judged by observing the word 'Draft', which appears well-defined and clear. There is no evident blurring or pixelation that could indicate digital alteration inconsistent with handwritten text. This supports the idea that the handwriting was naturally added.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word 'Draft'?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil's position indicates that it could have logically been used to write the word 'Draft'. This positioning remains consistent with the logic of writing, where the tip of the pencil appears to be near or partly obscuring the edge of the word, suggesting a practical alignment for the task.",
    "answer": "Yes"
