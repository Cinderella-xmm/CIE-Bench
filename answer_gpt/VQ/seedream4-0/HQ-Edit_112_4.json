    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bird’s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird resembles a Blue Jay and displays an anatomically correct form with meticulous detailing of the feathers. By world knowledge and a visual inspection, the Blue Jay’s proportions appear consistent with its natural bird structure, showing a precise representation without distortion in any limbs or exaggerated features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a glass dome that is clear and appears smooth, as evidenced by realistic reflections and refractions consistent with world knowledge about glass properties. The dome lacks visible seams or distortions, aligning with expectations for a high-quality glass enclosure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden perch is visually inspected to have a realistic grain texture appropriate to wood. It supports the bird securely with no visible gaps or sections that appear unstable, indicating proper alignment consistent with natural perching expectations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the ivy vines are positioned to rise naturally and curve in a believable manner. The leaves are spaced appropriately without evidence of clipping through other elements, portraying acceptable botanical growth patterns consistent with ivy characteristics.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the leaves and tree stump as scaled down in proportion to the bird, with detailed textures that add to realism. Positioned appropriately on the base, these elements do not appear oddly placed or misaligned, contributing to a harmonious scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss appears varied in color and texture, effectively mimicking organic growth patterns rather than uniform or artificial characteristics. The absence of abrupt edges or signs of digital pasting enhances the realistic scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, shadows are uniformly cast by the bird, perch, and dome in harmony with the light source positioned at the upper right. The gradients are soft, maintaining shadowing consistency without mismatched lighting anomalies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
