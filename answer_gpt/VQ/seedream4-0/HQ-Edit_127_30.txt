    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed violin body maintain consistent surface texture and lighting behavior with a high-quality engraved case, without unnatural sheen or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is showcased inside a case with a rich velvet interior. The surface of the violin appears smooth and glossy, reflecting light in a manner consistent with a well-polished instrument. The lighting is subtly diffused across the surface, indicating a professional finish without unnatural sheen. The velvet's texture in the case complements the reflective sheen of the violin, maintaining a high-quality appearance overall. Thus, the lighting behavior and texture are consistently aligned, showing no signs of a mismatch.",
