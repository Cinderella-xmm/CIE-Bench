      "question": "Are the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe free from unnatural textures and maintain their structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO figures are depicted with smooth, consistent surfaces that are typical of LEGO pieces. These features are devoid of any textures or irregularities that would suggest imperfection or inconsistency, which is coherent with the realistic rendering of LEGO materials. This natural appearance ensures that the LEGO figures remain structurally coherent, matching the expected look of actual LEGO products.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures appear undamaged and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigures in Image B possess precise geometric shapes characteristic of LEGO designs. Their edges, corners, and joints are sharply defined and unbroken, maintaining the structural integrity and recognizable form expected from LEGO creations. This indicates they are undamaged and consistent, providing a clean and cohesive appearance.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosing the LEGO scene look natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube in Image B appears to be smooth and clear, providing an unobstructed view of the LEGO scene within. Its transparency is natural, without scratches, smudges, or visual distortions that would indicate artifacts or flaws. This presentation contributes to the realism of the scene, ensuring the visual focus remains on the LEGO minifigures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the scene properly highlight the intricate details of the LEGO minifigures and the glass cube without causing any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is strategically placed to illuminate the LEGO characters and the glass cube effectively. It allows for the details of the minifigures to be visible, emphasizing the faces, hands, and design elements without casting harsh shadows or causing reflections that could distort perception. This kind of lighting is ideal for highlighting the scene clearly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the scene's earthy and natural tones without introducing unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B transitions smoothly from darker to lighter shades, complementing the natural tones of the LEGO minifigures and setting a neutral backdrop. This gradient does not display any unnatural patterns or marks, ensuring that the focus remains on the foreground subjects. The consistency of the background against the LEGO models enhances the overall presentation without competing for attention or causing detail loss.",
