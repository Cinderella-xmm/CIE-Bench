    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book has been transformed into a pop-up display within a glass cloche. The book's pages appear to be opened horizontally, with sculpted figures emerging from the pages. The visual cues suggest that the book maintains its proportions as there are no visible warps in the pages or inconsistent angles that would imply a loss of structural integrity. The clean edges and cohesive way the figures emerge from the pages indicate a well-executed transformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the quill positioned centrally and vertically as a stable pivot, with natural feather texture and metallic base that match the original materials?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a quill appears embedded centrally in the book's open seam, anchored in a metallic base. The positioning looks deliberate and balanced, as the quill stands vertically. The feather texture is fine, resembling natural feathers, and the metallic base has a similar design aesthetic to those in the setting around - complex and polished. These aspects confirm that the quill serves as a stable pivot while matching the original materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the inkwellâ€™s transformation into a fountain include realistic water flow and surface reflections without unnatural highlights or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not portray a real transformation of the inkwell into a fountain with water flow. Rather, the ink and quill are more part of the decorative setting of the scene, similar to Image A. Because there's no presence of water flow, the aspect of realistic water flow and reflections is not relevant here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the glass cloche transparent and free of distortion, with smooth curvature and accurate light refraction across all internal elements?",
    "explanation": "The glass cloche in Image B shows transparency allowing a clear view of the book and sculpted figures inside. The shape is consistent with the curvature typical of glass domes, and the light captured on its surface enhances realistic refraction without evident distortion. These visual cues confirm the cloche is designed with proper attention to light and transparency.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the engraved lines on the wooden base continuous, legible, and integrated with the wood texture without sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations?",
    "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B has engraved lines that are part of the design. These lines are clearly legible and appear continuous, integrating well with the naturally textured wood surface. No sharp breaks or unusual depth variations detract from the engravings. The engravings maintain coherence with the overall aesthetic of the piece.",
    "answer": "Yes"
