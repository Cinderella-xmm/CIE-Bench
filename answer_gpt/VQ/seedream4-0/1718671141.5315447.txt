    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the added brass gears and copper funnels exhibit a polished, metallic surface with realistic reflections typical of brass and copper materials. The reflectivity and highlights align with the lighting conditions, suggesting detailed and accurate texturing. There is no evidence of pixelation or artificial textures that would detract from this realism, indicating a high-quality integration of these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows clock faces added to the dome, correctly following the curvature of the surface. The numerals and clock hands appear straight and well-aligned, adhering to the spherical shape without distortion. This suggests careful placement and rendering, ensuring that the elements do not suffer from perspective distortion or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the steam shows a wispy and soft appearance, typical of steam visualized in similar lighting conditions, with varying opacity that suggests a volumetric nature. It disperses naturally from the vents and shows no signs of harsh edges or clustering that would suggest unnatural or artificial rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
    "explanation": "The ornamental metal details on the dome in Image B are integrated seamlessly into the structure. They are continuous and well-scaled, fitting the dimensions of the dome perfectly. There are no visible gaps or overlapping, and the edges are smooth and well-defined, indicating a complete and high-quality rendering of these additions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
    "explanation": "The reflection in the water in Image B is a mirror image of the building above it, capturing the full details of the steampunk elements, including gears, clock faces, and steam vents, without any distortion. The symmetry of the reflection suggests accurate rendering in alignment with the structure's geometry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
