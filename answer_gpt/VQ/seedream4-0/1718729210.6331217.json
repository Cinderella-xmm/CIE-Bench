      "question": "Does the scarecrowâ€™s body exhibit a consistent glossy finish across all areas where straw was replaced, without visible seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow's body is covered with a glossy material, which has a different texture compared to the original straw material in Image A. The glossy finish appears to be consistent across the entire body, as there are no visible seams or breaks in the material. The reflections are smooth and do not show any signs of unnatural distortion or texture mismatches, indicating a uniform application of the material and careful handling of light. The lighting complements the glossy finish, enhancing the seamless look across all areas.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hat structurally intact and proportionally consistent with the original, featuring a clearly defined opening at the top that allows for candle placement without distorting its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow's original hat is replaced with a lantern placed on top, which holds a candle. The original hat's conical structure present in Image A has been altered to accommodate the candle, as evident by the lantern's flat bottom base. This change affects the hat's overall structural design and proportion, moving away from the hat-like appearance. The lantern's presence indicates an alteration that does not maintain the hat's previous proportions and style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LED string lights positioned along the scarecrow or packaging in a way that emits soft, localized light without causing unnatural bright spots, flickering effects, or visible wiring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the string lights are wrapped around the scarecrow, creating a soft glow that appears natural. The lights are evenly distributed, providing a balanced illumination without any excessively bright spots or visible wiring that could distract from the overall aesthetic. The ambient glow enhances the scene subtly, suggesting careful attention to light distribution and integration with the scarecrow's glossy surface, providing a pleasing visual effect consistent with good lighting practices.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crow figurine resting stably on the top edge of the box, aligned with gravitational logic, and matching the size and proportions of the birds seen in flight in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crow figurine is not actually resting on the top edge of the box; instead, it is placed on top of a lantern that replaces the original hat. The crow is positioned stably at the top, appearing balanced and aligned with gravity. In comparison to the birds in flight in the background, the crow figurine seems slightly larger but still proportionate, providing a harmonious scale relative to the scarecrow's size, ensuring it matches the general bird sizes and maintains the scene's natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the packaging surrounding the scarecrow have clean edges, consistent material shading, and proper shadow alignment with the light source, indicating a solid, three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow stands on a box with clearly defined edges and consistent shading, suggesting a three-dimensional structure. The box shows proper alignment with the light source, matching shadows that correspond naturally with the surrounding scene's lighting. The box's design, including festive markings, ensures the packaging appears as a singular, coherent piece, exhibiting careful attention to edge detail and material consistency. This enhances the realism and dimensionality of the box within the image.",
