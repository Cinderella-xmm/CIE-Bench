      "question": "Do the restored areas of the clock tower seamlessly integrate with the original stone texture, avoiding any visible seams or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the stone, especially around the damaged sections that appear restored, aligns cohesively with the rest of the tower. The color and surface consistency match well, suggesting efforts to integrate seamlessly with any existing material. Referring to Image A for comparison, there is no noticeable discrepancy between the original and edited textures in Image B, indicating no unnatural patches or seams.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the restored sections, such as the arches and clock face, consistent with the rest of the tower, avoiding any distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the restored arches and clock face maintain uniformity with the rest of the tower's proportions. Visual cues in the edited image suggest that care was taken to keep everything symmetrical and consistent structurally. Comparing with Image A, significant attention to detail ensures the proportions remain intact, depicting no noticeable distortions or irregularities.",

      "question": "Have the fine details, such as cracks and weathering patterns, been accurately replicated in the restored sections, preserving the historical look without losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the intricate details of the stone surface, including cracks and weathering patterns, are visible. This suggests an effort to replicate the existing design traits carefully, as observed in older sections of similar gothic-style architecture. Image A confirms the preservation of these details, with Image B accurately maintaining the historical look through detailed texturing.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the restoration work enhance the tower's completeness, making it appear as though it was never damaged, while preserving its architectural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a tower that appears structurally whole and uninterrupted, suggesting no visible signs of damage restoration. The architectural elements like shape and texture work in harmonizing the restored areas with the existing build. In Image A, the damage is evident, but the edits in Image B correct this while preserving the architectural style, making the tower appear whole as if it had not been damaged.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the restored sections exhibit the same lighting and shadow effects as the original parts of the tower, contributing to a natural and cohesive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals consistent lighting and shadowing effects across the entire structure, including the restored sections. This demonstrates an effort to maintain natural illumination that assists in creating a lifelike and cohesive appearance. Image A shows lighting variations, which are harmoniously replicated in Image B, securing the illusion of intactness within the overall composition.",
