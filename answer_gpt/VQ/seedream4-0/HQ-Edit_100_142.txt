    "Question": "Q1: Are the brushstrokes applied to the man’s clothing and headwrap consistent in direction and intensity, maintaining the pattern’s integrity without distorting the fabric’s shape or introducing pixelated or smudged textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstrokes are visible on the man's clothing and headwrap, and while they maintain artistic consistency, they are stylized to convey an impressionistic painting style. The patterns and colors are preserved, showing skillful application without distortion or pixelation. The brushstrokes mirror traditional painting methods where texture adds depth without altering the fabric’s intended design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the background blur smooth and uniform across the horizon, with no jagged edges, double contours, or inconsistent color patches that break the continuity of the landscape?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays an artistically rendered landscape with brushstrokes that provide texture and motion. While the horizon is clear, the artistic choices do not emphasize a uniform blur but rather a textured blur typical to painted landscapes. The transition of colors is fluid, avoiding any jagged edges or inconsistent patches that would disrupt the continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the drum retain its circular shape and consistent rim structure, with paint layers applied in a way that follows the curvature without flattening or stretching the surface unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the drum is painted with care to maintain its circular shape. The application of color respects the drum's original form, and brushstrokes follow the curvature well, preserving the dimension and surface quality without causing flattening or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the stylized grass and tree forms elongated or curved in a way that suggests motion but still preserve recognizable plant structures, such as upright trunks and branching patterns, without appearing fragmented or floating?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the landscape with grass and trees that are stylized through brushstrokes suggesting motion. The vegetation retains recognizable features such as upright trunks and discernible branching patterns, consistently preserving structural integrity despite the artistic effects intended to convey dynamism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do both hands display five distinct fingers with anatomically correct spacing and joint alignment, and are the fingers proportionally sized relative to the arms and drum without appearing stretched or compressed?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the hands with clear attention to anatomical detail despite the artistic styling. Each hand shows five distinct fingers, spaced and aligned correctly, ensuring proportionality with the rest of the body and the drum. The brushwork preserves the natural appearance of finger and joint architecture without stretching or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
