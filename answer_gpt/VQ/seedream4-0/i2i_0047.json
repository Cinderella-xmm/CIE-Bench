      "question": "Does the transition between the train and the cyberpunk background appear seamless without obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a bright, neon-lit city, fitting a cyberpunk aesthetic. The skateboarder is well integrated with this environment, showing smooth and consistent transitions between subject and background without visible artifacts or mismatched textures. Commonly, a seamless edit does not break the visual in terms of color and texture clashes asynchronously, and these aspects are well handled here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections of neon lights on the train surface realistic and consistent with the expected behavior of light in a cyberpunk setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lights interact with the skateboard and its surroundings but not with a train, which is not present in this scenario. However, considering the ambient interaction, the reflections would generally need to follow the behavior of high-intensity neon lights, casting realistic color glows and reflections. However, such interactions are absent where the train is replaced entirely with the skateboarder setting.",

      "question": "Do the added headphones on the driver look natural and do they preserve the driver's visibility without obscuring important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboarder is wearing headphones, which match the neon aesthetic with glowing elements. Such headphones fit the style and do not obscure any significant feature of the subject. Naturally, in such settings, headphones designed with incorporation into digital elements are executed worry-free without reducing the visibility of the rest of the onboard features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the motion blur effect applied in a way that suggests movement without causing the train to appear distorted or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is portrayed with a motion blur effect suggesting fast movement, typical in futuristic or cyberpunk scenes. This effect is managed to keep the skateboard and rider precise without losing critical detail, which indicates purposeful dynamic momentum without distortion. A good motion blur replicates speed and cohesion of subject definition within the motion path.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall transformed image maintain a consistent edgy and cool style without introducing conflicting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyberpunk theme with vivid, colorful neon lights and a young skateboarder wearing stylish headphones suggests an aesthetic transformation tailored to maintain a unified and cool, futuristic vibe. Elements such as lighting, subject posture, and accessories are consistent and harmonized within this style framework, avoiding disjoint characters or elements.",
