      "question": "Does the basketball motif on Patrick’s shirt appear seamlessly integrated with the fabric texture, without visible seams, jagged edges, or unnatural color blending?",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Patrick is wearing a shirt with basketball motifs. By analyzing the image, the basketball motifs appear to be smoothly integrated into the shirt's fabric texture. There are no visible seams or jagged edges disrupting the pattern, and the color blending between the motifs and the shirt is natural. This suggests a high-quality integration of the pattern onto the fabric, leading to a conclusion that no obvious editing flaws are present.",
