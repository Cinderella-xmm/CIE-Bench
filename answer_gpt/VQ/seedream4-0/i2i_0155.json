      "question": "Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Breathe' is placed in the top left corner, a region that does not overlap with the plant. This placement ensures that the plant's structural appearance remains undisturbed. The text is also designed to blend well with the background, integrating naturally without causing any visible artifacts or disruptions.",

      "question": "Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, 'Calm' is positioned in the bottom right corner of the image, away from the window frame and the plant. This placement choice keeps the window frame's geometry intact, maintaining the original image proportions and visual plausibility without interfering with the scene's existing elements.",

      "question": "Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm' are placed such that they do not interfere with the plant or light reflections and shadows on the leaves. The leaves continue to show consistent light reflections and shadows based on the light source from the window, implying that the addition of text has not altered these visual aspects.",

      "question": "Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the terracotta pot and saucer retain their authentic texture details. The text additions are placed away from the pot, ensuring no effect on their visual quality. The textures of the pot and saucer appear consistent and without the introduction of any new or unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The words 'Breathe' and 'Calm' are strategically placed in non-intrusive areas of Image B, respecting the plant's form and the overall symmetry of the window. There is no distortion or disruption in the image's proportions, indicating a careful and thoughtful placement that preserves the original scene's visual harmony.",
