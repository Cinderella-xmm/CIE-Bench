      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they maintain natural contours without exaggerated or distorted lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, although we cannot evaluate the facial features due to the blurring, we can assess how other features align with human anatomy. The contour of the head shape appears consistent with human anatomy. Given Image B's depiction in a stylized illustrative format, some abstraction is typical; however, considering common chibi or artistic styles, proportional consistency is often retained. Thus, the contours remain without exaggerated distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents follow the existing pattern flow and appear integrated into the textile without unnatural highlights or floating textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf accents are visible, and they follow a consistent pattern flow integrated into the robe's design. The illustration style suggests an artistic interpretation where such details are simplified or stylized. Given this context, they appear to be seamlessly part of the existing textile pattern, with no sign of unnatural highlights.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, proper joint structure, and natural skin texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands have been rendered with five fingers each, but they are simplified in style, typical to illustrated forms. While there is less detail in joint structure or skin texture compared to Image A, it is consistent with stylized illustration norms, where anatomical precision is not the focus. Nonetheless, the hands are proportionate within the artistic context and do not present stretching or significant blurring.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the floral outlines extend naturally from the robe into the indigo border without sudden breaks, inconsistent linework, or misaligned patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral designs are primarily contained within the robe area, but the illustrative style is less detailed regarding extension into border regions compared to Image A. The indigo frame exists for border definition rather than pattern continuation. Therefore, though the flowers do not naturally extend into this border, within the stylized context there are no sudden breaks or misalignment within the expected scope of illustration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the textile materials retain visible texture variation and depth, avoiding flatness or pixelation that would suggest degraded quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "From Image B's style, which is a simplified illustration, the textile materials appear less textured compared to Image A's realistic depiction. However, this flatness is intentional due to the illustrative nature, not due to quality degradation. Variations and depth are suggested through linework and color choices, maintaining integrity without signs of pixelation or quality degradation typical of digitally edited illustrations.",
