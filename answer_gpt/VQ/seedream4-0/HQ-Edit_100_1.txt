    "Question": "Q1: Does the tree in the edited image maintain natural branch proportions and trunk thickness relative to the surrounding elements, without appearing unnaturally shrunk or warped?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the tree is designed as part of a miniature scene within a box. The branches and trunk are proportionally crafted to fit this artistic format. They appear appropriately scaled to resemble a tree without seeming unnaturally shrunk or warped relative to the other art elements like the flowers and clouds in this boxed setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures on the tree's bark and leaves consistent with natural materials, showing no signs of digital over-enhancement such as repeating patterns or unnatural gloss?",
    "explanation": "The edited image showcases a crafted tree with leaf textures mimicking natural appearances but designed from art materials visible as paper-like or fabric finishes. The textures and colors exhibit hand-crafted details without digital enhancement artifacts like repeating patterns or unnatural gloss.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the flower patches beneath the tree uniformly distributed and blended into the existing meadow, without visible cloning artifacts, sharp edges, or color inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the flower patches are part of the crafted landscape within the box. They are manually positioned and arranged with a clear artistic layering over a textured bed mimicking grass. These patches fit the scene's handcrafted style without displaying digital cloning artifacts or sharp edges. They are integral to the art piece's composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the tree seamlessly blended, with no visible layering lines, color jumps, or flat regions that break the illusion of depth?",
    "explanation": "The background consists of artistically painted panels that form a backdrop to the tree and flora. They display varied colors and shapes but are intentionally designed with stylistic distinctions reflecting an artistic rather than natural depth. These panels visibly demarcate the different sections behind the tree, consistent with the intended art format rather than breaking depth in a digital or unexpected manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the cloud figures positioned above the scene on thin, non-visible wires, appearing small and light enough to suggest suspension, without overlapping or intersecting with the tree or ground?",
    "explanation": "The edited image illustrates small cloud figures attached above the scene with visible fine wires that contribute to the illusion of suspension. The figure size and positioning maintain a separate spatial placement, not overlapping or intersecting with the tree or ground elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the wooden frame clearly visible around the scene with consistent material appearance, straight edges, and proper shadowing that indicates a three-dimensional box structure?",
    "explanation": "The frame surrounding the scene in the edited image is a distinct wooden box, visible with straight edges and shadowing that precisely conveys its three-dimensional box structure. The material appearance of the frame is consistent and effectively complements the contained art scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
