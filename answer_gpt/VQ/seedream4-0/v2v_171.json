      "question": "Does the chibi Funko Pop-style figure maintain the structural coherence of the child's facial features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure reflects typical Funko Pop stylization. These figures are characterized by oversized heads and simplified features, departing from realistic proportions. This is part of their charm and iconic design rather than a distortion. Therefore, while facial features do differ from reality, they are consistent with stylized collectibles and not considered structurally incoherent or unnaturally distorted from the perspective of collectible design norms.",

      "question": "Are the tech-related accessories added to the chibi figure free of unnatural textures and integrated smoothly with the figure's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure in Image B is equipped with headphones, which appear well-integrated into its design. The accessory shows coherent texturing, compatible with the overall plastic-like material typical of collectible figurines. These are aligned with a typical Funko Pop aesthetic where accessories complement the figure's simple design.",

      "question": "Does the casual attire of the chibi figure retain its realistic texture and detail, avoiding any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The attire of the chibi figure in Image B is consistent with the stylized toy aesthetics, displaying simplified textures typical for Funko Pop figures. The fabric appears smooth, as is customary for collectible figures, rather than losing detail since detail is typically implied through simplistic lines and minimal textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cross-legged sitting pose of the chibi figure with the tablet anatomically plausible and free of any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure's pose with crossed legs holding a tablet is anatomically plausible for its stylized format. Despite the exaggeration typical in Funko Pop figures, the posture reflects a human-like configuration without any noticeable distortions, considering the constraints and stylization of such figures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is depicted with clean textures and lighting that reflect its plastic make, typical of Funko Pop designs. Although not lifelike in terms of realism, the presentation is consistent with product visualization norms, with effective lighting that highlights the figure's features, rendering the visualization plausible in the context of toy commercial imagery.",
