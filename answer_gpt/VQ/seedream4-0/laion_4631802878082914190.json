    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters such as the owl and the raccoon are placed on stones labeled with process steps like 'Business' and 'Deployment,' which correspond to similar positions in Image A's diagram. These positions reflect the original process boxes' locations and do not overlap or shift into areas meant for other characters or steps. This placement appears to maintain the integrity of the original diagram's structure without disrupting neighboring elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path linking the characters follows a circular route reminiscent of the original diagram. The path uses stones and wooden structures to create a playful, continuous pathway that guides the viewer's eye smoothly from one character to the next without gaps or disruptive turns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal cluster in Image B is placed centrally within the diagram. Its size is proportionate, ensuring it serves as a focal point without overshadowing the animal characters or causing them to appear diminished. The crystals enhance the thematic metaphor of a 'data journey' without interfering with the overall balance of the composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles are placed strategically close to the relevant characters (e.g., the cat and the deer) without overlapping the characters themselves or other graphic elements. The text within is consistent in size and font, ensuring that the speech is legible and the character's voice is clear.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal characters in Image B are drawn with anthropomorphized features that allow them to interact believably with props. The owl uses a magnifying glass and the raccoon operates a laptop in ways that align with typical ergonomic use while respecting the anatomy of each animal's design. This creative license is common in animated and illustrated storytelling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a cohesive visual style; the line art, shading, and color saturation are consistently applied across characters, paths, and background elements. This consistency maintains a unified aesthetic without any jarring changes in artistic style or mismatched textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the title banner located at the top edge of the image, fully visible, and not overlapping any part of the diagram or characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is positioned at the topmost section of the image, clearly displaying the text 'The Adventures of Data Journey!'. It is fully visible and does not impinge on the space allocated for the diagram or the animal characters, thus ensuring clarity and focus on the title.",
