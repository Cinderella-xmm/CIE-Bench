    "Question": "Q3: Do the newly added elements in the background (stars, luminous flowers, lanterns) follow consistent lighting direction and depth cues without creating visual inconsistencies or floating objects?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is filled with stars, luminous flowers, and lanterns that provide a coherent and consistent lighting theme. The depth is maintained well as the light from these objects casts appropriate glows and shadows, aligning with the main subject's illumination. There are no floating or visually inconsistent elements, indicating a harmonious integration with the overall scene.",
