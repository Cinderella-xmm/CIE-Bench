    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the crystal facets on the fish's body follow the natural curves and scale patterns of the original wooden carving without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess this, we need to closely examine the crystal fish’s body for adherence to natural curves and scale patterns. While Image B showcases a faceted crystal fish that maintains the spiral shape of the original, the irregular, highly geometric facets introduce distortion that contrasts with the natural carved patterns in Image A. Common knowledge tells us that sharp geometric shapes, such as facets, cause some distortion rather than strictly following organic lines and scales.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy surfaces of the crystal fish uniformly reflective and free from abrupt texture changes or matte patches that break the illusion of fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals a uniform high gloss across the crystal surface, with consistent reflections typical of polished facets. There are no visible matte areas or abrupt changes in texture that would disrupt the illusion of fluidity, which aligns with common properties of crystal materials known to reflect light smoothly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spiral shape of the fish preserved in the crystal version, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spiral shape of the fish seen in Image B retains the same general form and alignment visible in Image A, adhering to the original outline without any discernible stretching or compression of segments. This observation aligns with world knowledge that sculptures often maintain their intended shapes across different materials unless purposefully altered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mirrored pedestal beneath the crystal fish reflect the sculpture accurately, with no visible distortions or missing reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Close inspection of Image B shows the pedestal reflecting the crystal fish without any visible distortion, providing a mirror image that matches the object's features accurately. This is consistent with world knowledge that mirrored surfaces can produce high fidelity reflections when properly configured.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures clearly preserved in the crystal version without fading or smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s crystal fish shows facets that create a more abstract representation of details seen in Image A's wooden version. The facets can obscure or simplify fine details like gill lines and fin textures, naturally causing some smoothing and loss of specific features known in faceted designs, which contrasts with the original's intricately carved details.",
