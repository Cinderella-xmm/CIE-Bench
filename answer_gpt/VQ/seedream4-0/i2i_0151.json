      "question": "Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is presented with a clear and consistent geometric shape. The kite retains the form of a traditional diamond shape, with sharp and well-defined edges, much like we would expect from a well-made kite. The details are precise, and the structure appears intact without distortions or visible damage. Despite any alterations surrounding it, the kite itself retains its intended shape, which indicates it has not been distorted or damaged.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite appears smooth and consistent in texture, typical of a paper or light fabric material usually used for kites. There are no visible anomalies or unwanted patterns that would suggest an unnatural texture. The visual information provided aligns with the expected appearance of such a material, suggesting there aren't any unnatural textures present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow color of the kite in Image B is even and uniform. It stands out naturally against the blue sky, adhering to typical color contrasts and expectations for such an environment. There aren't any unusual shades or color variations that would make the kite appear unnatural or inconsistent with its setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the kite in Image B is clearly connected to the body and flows smoothly, suggesting a structural coherence typical in kite designs. The transition from the kite to its tail is seamless, with the tail appearing as a natural extension of the kite without visible inconsistencies, breaks, or unusual attachment points.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The string of the kite in Image B is depicted as a fine, consistent line, much like the thin strings used in kite flying. It does not possess any unusual thickness or artifacts that would make it appear unrealistic or disconnected from the natural depiction of a kite string. This suggests a natural and believable representation.",
