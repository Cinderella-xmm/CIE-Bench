    "Question": "Q1: Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the textures are designed to resemble clouds, which are inherently soft, fluffy, and layered. Observing the visual cues, there is a lack of flat or blocky regions, as smooth and swirling patterns are evident. The cloud formations have a natural, continuous flow which reflects an intention to mimic real clouds without harsher geometric shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
    "explanation": "Image B transforms the structure into forms that mimic branching antlers and flowing mist. While antlers have some rigidity, their natural form often includes smooth curves, and the smoke-like structures add to this fluid appearance without sharp breaks. This contrasts with wooden structures which are typically straight and angular.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are noticeable as part of the cloud-like structure. Their integration appears smooth, as the color transitions and positioning do not create noticeable dissonance with the surrounding textures. The visual incorporates them naturally without jarring contrasts or edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, there is a mist trail extending from the structure, resembling smoke that rises and dissipates naturally. The texture is consistent with the rest of the cloud-like appearance and fades at the edges in a way mimicking real mist, showing continuity and smooth transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a highly imaginative and transformed version of the sofa, where natural alignment and typical structure comparable to a standard sofa are not preserved. The design focuses more on organic and ethereal elements rather than maintaining traditional sofa alignment, showcasing creativity over geometric precision.",
    "answer": "No"
