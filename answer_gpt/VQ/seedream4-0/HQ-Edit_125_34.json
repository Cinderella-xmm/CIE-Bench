    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass gears and levers on the desk properly aligned with the deskâ€™s structure, showing no signs of floating, misshapen geometry, or unnatural material seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the brass gears and levers appear to be integrated into the desk structure without any visible signs of floating or misalignment. There are no indications of distorted geometry or unnatural seams that would suggest they are improperly placed. The elements are consistent with the era and style of the desk, implying thoughtful design integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the modified books display consistent glowing effects without distorting their page edges or causing unnatural light bleeding into surrounding surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing effects on the books are carefully applied, as seen in Image B. The edges of the books remain sharp and undistorted, and there is no unnatural light bleeding that disrupts the other nearby elements. The glowing is localized to specific books, enhancing their appearance without affecting surrounding surfaces inappropriately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the holographic globe above the monitor clearly visible with proper depth and transparency, and does it cast natural shadows or reflections on the desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic globe above the monitor is actually replaced by a blueprint-style image on the monitor itself, so there is no visible holographic globe to evaluate. Thus, evaluating the depth, transparency, or shadows and reflections does not apply to this particular element in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the newly added ornate frames around the windows seamlessly integrated with the existing window structure, without overlapping glass panes or creating distorted perspective lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate frames added around the windows in Image B are intricately designed and do not overlap the glass panes in a manner that causes visual disruption. The perspective lines are maintained, indicating careful alignment and integration with the existing window structure, preserving the overall aesthetic unity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements (gears, glowing books, hologram, window frames) share consistent lighting and shadow behavior, avoiding abrupt changes in brightness or material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting across all edited elements, including the gears, glowing books, and window frames, appears consistent. There are no sudden shifts in brightness or material properties that would suggest inconsistency in light and shadow behavior. The elements blend well within the scene's ambiance, maintaining a coherent lighting scheme throughout.",
