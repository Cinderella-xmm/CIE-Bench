    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is depicted as being constructed from LEGO bricks. The sections in question, orange, black, and silver, show a clear pattern of LEGO bricks, characterized by their uniform size and consistent alignment typical of LEGO construction. There are no signs of blurring or inconsistent textures, suggesting a careful assembly that maintains a clear and organized pattern, which effectively emulates the appearance of a vehicle built with LEGO pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are made of circular gray LEGO pieces. These pieces maintain the correct proportions typical of LEGO constructions and display a solid geometric structure without any visible deformations or jagged edges. The design remains consistent with LEGO's style, where wheels are structured to fit smoothly without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed is covered with black LEGO tiles. These tiles are arranged in a regular grid pattern, demonstrating the uniformity and precision typical of LEGO constructions. The tiles are flat and smooth, arranged without any noticeable gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges, which ensures a clean and well-organized appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO truck is placed on a white shelf. The truck appears to be securely positioned with no visible gaps or floating effects, indicating stable and secure placement. The shelf underneath extends appropriately to cover the full width of the truck, providing adequate support and maintaining a balanced appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural components like the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers are recreated using LEGO pieces. These parts are accurately proportioned and align properly with the truck's body, reflecting the detailed and precise nature of LEGO construction. Each component is clearly distinguishable and fits seamlessly into the overall design, suggesting faithful reproduction in LEGO form.",
