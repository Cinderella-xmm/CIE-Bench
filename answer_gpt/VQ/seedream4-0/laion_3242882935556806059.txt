    "Question": "Q1: Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?",
    "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the petals are designed to resemble lily petals with jagged crystal facets following the natural curvature. This mirrors the rounded and pointed appearance typical of lily petals. The crystal geometry is well-crafted to represent the natural curves without apparent warping or geometric breaks, reflecting the original aesthetics while enhancing it with a crystalline texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass rods are depicted extending from the vase in a manner that mimics the stems in Image A. The rods rise vertically and uniformly from the vase, maintaining the structure and spacing of the original floral stems. This careful alignment gives the appearance of continuity and natural growth similar to fresh flower stems.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a black marble surface that appears smooth and uniformly dark. The surface reflects light sources consistently, and shadows are cast accurately considering the vase and crystal arrangement above it. The highlights, especially around the edge of the vase and where light hits the marble, are coherent with standard light interaction with shiny surfaces like marble.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?",
    "explanation": "The crystal petals in Image B display a range of amber hues, contributing to the depth and richness of the edited image. The variations in transparency and color, alongside observable light refractions, create depth cues that suggest both volume and translucencyâ€”important traits when crafting a realistic, multi-faceted crystal structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?",
    "explanation": "The glass rods in Image B enter the water at angles which indicate the phenomenon of refraction. The bending at the waterline is subtle, yet observable, reflecting the physical reality of light interaction with water. Additionally, the rods remain visible below the waterline as they continue into the vase, with no signs of floating or disappearing may present, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of how they are depicted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
