      "question": "Does the claymation texture applied to the cocktail glass maintain its structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the claymation style is distinctly visible and maintains the structural coherence of the cocktail glass. The glass retains its overall shape, design, and coherence, with the intended artistic texture typical of claymation style where fine details are replaced with broader, larger sculptural elements, which is expected in such an artistic interpretation. Hence, the claymation texture does not introduce unnatural textures beyond what is typical for clay art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ice cubes and liquid in the cocktail retain their visual plausibility and natural appearance after being converted into a claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes in the claymation version are rendered as large square blocks, which is consistent with the claymation style but loses visual plausibility compared to real ice cubes and liquid. The ice does not convey transparency or the nuanced texture of real ice, and the liquid seems solidified rather than fluid. Therefore, the visual effect loses its natural appearance in the adaptation.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the lime slice and straw preserved without distortion in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime slice maintains a familiar wedge shape, and the straw also retains its cylindrical form. While the textures are adapted to a claymation style, the geometric shapes of both objects are reasonably preserved without significant distortion, maintaining their recognizability despite stylistic changes.",

      "question": "Does the background, including the bar counter and bottles, retain its structural integrity and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background, including the bar counter and bottles, translates into a claymation aesthetic which is consistent in terms of structural integrity. The identifiable forms of the bottles and bar are coherent within the claymation interpretation, keeping a simplistic and stylistically unified look without noticeable unnatural artifacts. The visual coherence is maintained by adapting elements to match the clay style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects logically consistent in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects retain logical consistency relative to the claymation design. The glass is properly placed on the napkin, and the spatial arrangement aligns with realistic settings, keeping expected relationships despite the stylistic transformation.",
