    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seat cushion is composed of LEGO bricks, which are uniformly sized and characteristically have clearly defined ridges and studs. The black color is consistent throughout the LEGO bricks without any visual disruptions or artifacts typical of LEGO construction. The smooth gradient description aligns with the visual appearance of the evenly spaced bricks. Analyzing this, it meets the criteria of being uniformly sized and visually consistent in color.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the backrest crafted from LEGO bricks, arranged in horizontal layers. The alignment of these bricks is consistent and follows a smooth contour akin to the original backrest shape. There are no visible gaps or misalignments; the bricks appear to be evenly spaced, maintaining the structure's integrity without irregular spacing. This interpretation matches the description provided.",

      "question": "Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are seen as hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges. The depiction shows the silver finish, which is uniform and mirrors the curvature of the original chair's armrests. The LEGO construction maintains connection points without distortion, indicating the armrests are accurately depicted within these criteria.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each wheel is depicted using translucent LEGO material, a characteristic design feature that allows visibility of internal structures often seen in LEGO wheels. The wheels appear consistent in size and are correctly placed under the chair's base, akin to the structure visible in traditional office chairs. This observation aligns well with the description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While analyzing Image B, the chair sits on a flat white tabletop, contrasting sharply with Image A's darker flooring. There are no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies that suggest misalignment, as the surface appears smooth and uninterrupted. This adjustment from the original setting provides a significant change in presentation and clarity, consistent with the provided description.",
