      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the elephant have clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is examined for its clarity and smoothness. The edges appear clear and sharp, with no visible distortions or artifacts that can detract from its appearance. Typically, well-designed glass cases have smooth edges and no unnatural reflections unless the lighting in the room causes such effects. In this case, the lighting seems to be even, ensuring there are no distortions.",

      "question": "Are the metallic resin details on the elephantâ€™s armor consistently textured and reflective, showing no unnatural glossiness or broken patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the elephant's armor in Image B, the metallic resin details appear uniform and reflective, consistent with high-quality crafting. There is a realistic sheen that matches the typical behavior of metals under light, without any breaks or unnatural glossiness that would suggest poor editing or rendering. Such details typically require careful attention in digital imaging to maintain the appearance of authenticity.",

      "question": "Are the silk-gold banners located at the four corners of the glass case, properly anchored, and displaying natural fabric draping and color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silk-gold banners are examined for natural fabric appearance. They seem to be correctly placed at the corners, and the draping looks fluid and natural without appearing artificial or stiff. The color shows a gradient typical of silk, which suggests quality image manipulation and realistic rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the layered mountain silhouettes in the background show gradual opacity and depth, with no sharp edges or inconsistent transparency levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features mountain silhouettes that are layered for depth in the background. These appear with a gradual shift in opacity, creating a sense of atmospheric depth. The edges are smooth and there is consistent transparency, without abrupt changes that could create a jagged or unrealistic effect. This effect often requires careful attention to blending settings in digital art to ensure realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges realistically integrated into the rocky surface, with natural leaf textures and root placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bonsai trees positioned at the foreground appear to be seamlessly integrated into the rocky surface. The texture of the leaves and the placement of the roots look natural, suggesting careful editing to uphold realism. The integration of such elements typically requires attention to detail regarding scale and textural fidelity.",
