      "question": "Does the monocle added to the tortilla chip maintain a consistent size and shape relative to the chip, and is it seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monocle on the tortilla chip appears correctly proportioned to the scale of the chip. It does not exhibit visible artifacts, and shading aligns well with the chip's texture, indicating seamless integration without inconsistencies in size or shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound proportionally sized and shaped like a realistic hand, with no more than five fingers and natural joint lines, and does it appear to emerge naturally from the guacamole without breaking its texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis involves checking the size and shape of the appendage to ensure it resembles a realistic hand. The appendage here is more cartoon-like, lacking detailed features of a real hand such as five fingers and joint lines, and doesn't naturally emerge from the guacamole but rather appears digitally added.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spice rack positioned behind the tortilla chip in a way that respects perspective and shadow direction, and does it blend naturally with the existing background without visible seams or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spice rack appears consistent in perspective relative to the other elements in the image. Its integration respects shadow direction effectively, blending with the kitchen background naturally without visible seams or mismatch in colors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mini flag banners aligned horizontally and evenly spaced above the table, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the light source, without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flag banners are studied for alignment and spacing relative to each other and the environment. They are positioned evenly and cast shadows that correspond with the light direction, reducing the appearance of being flat or digitally pasted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole been adjusted to pastel shades without losing their inherent textures or becoming unnaturally pale or washed out, maintaining visual credibility as edible items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tortilla chip and guacamole are assessed for color adjustments. They retain their textures and do not appear pale or washed out. The pastel shades added maintain their visual credibility as edible items despite the color change.",
