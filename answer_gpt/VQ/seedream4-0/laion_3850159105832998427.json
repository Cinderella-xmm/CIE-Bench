      "question": "Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's horns are integrated into the headstock in such a way that they extend symmetrically from both sides of the headstock's top. The horns are well-aligned with the neck, following a parallel angle, without any visible signs of misalignment or distortion. This symmetric integration helps maintain the balance and aesthetic appeal of the composition, allowing the horns to appear seamlessly as part of the overall design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the runes on the fretboard are brightly lit and distinctly outlined. They are embedded into the fretboard, rather than floating on top of it, and do not appear smeared or displaced. The runes maintain clarity and a consistent luminescence along the length of the fretboard, suggesting they were integrated with precision to ensure their visibility without visual errors.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fiery tendrils in Image B emanate from the bridge area, climbing upwards along the neck towards the nut. The tendrils display a continuous flow, smoothly connecting from the origin to the endpoint without any noticeable breaks or segments that appear to defy physics by floating separately. Their integration aligns with natural movement, enhancing the dynamic effect of flame wrapping around the guitar.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B extend gracefully from either side of the guitar's body, mirroring each other in terms of size, shape, and positioning. The scale patterns on the wings are consistent, realistic, and evenly spaced, creating a balanced and cohesive design. There are no visible gaps or irregularities in the texture, suggesting a high level of precision in the depiction of the dragon's wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body retains its original shape and contour but is modified with dragon-like elements such as scales and ridges. These textures are blended seamlessly onto the guitar's body without disrupting the original silhouette or creating visible seams. The detailing is consistent and enhances the overall visual theme, preserving the integrity of the guitar's form while adding mythical characteristics.",
