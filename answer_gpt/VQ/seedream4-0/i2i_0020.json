      "question": "Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the train and STOP sign exhibit clear geometric shapes and lines without any visible distortions or breaks. The simplification follows a consistent approach in minimizing details while keeping the essence intact. By observing the outline and form, particularly the stop sign's perfect octagon and the train's rectangular windows and red strips, it's evident that the shapes are simplified yet accurately represented.",

      "question": "Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain outlines are rendered in smooth geometrical forms, consistent with the minimalist style that favors simplicity and abstraction. The tracks are represented with consistent linear elements, reinforcing the illustration's stylistic coherence. The contrast of cool tones with the simple shapes effectively aligns with the minimalist theme, ensuring a natural integration.",

      "question": "Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the train and STOP sign are devoid of detailed textures, which is typical in minimalist art. However, they are sufficiently detailed to convey their identities effectively, with well-defined shapes and colors that prevent them from appearing unnatural or overly abstracted. The visual simplification retains essential features like stripes and letters, preserving their functionality and recognizability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B consistently aligns the train, STOP sign, and tracks in a spatial arrangement that mirrors real-world positioning. The elements maintain correct proportions and perspectives; the train is parallel to the tracks, the sign stays vertically upright, and the mountain backdrop appropriately recedes. These spatial cues preserve visual credibility and allow the viewer to perceive the scene naturally.",

      "question": "Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a cool-toned color palette with shades of blue, green, and gray, harmonizing with the minimalist style. This palette is consistent throughout the illustration, supporting a calm and serious atmosphere that aligns with traffic safety themes. The consistent use of these tones helps communicate a mature and secure visual message.",
