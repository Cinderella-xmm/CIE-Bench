      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the added cogs and gears on the lamp's armature properly aligned with the existing structure, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions without visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp has been significantly altered to include cogs and gears along its armature. These components are essential elements of steampunk design, which meshes Victorian aesthetics with mechanical intricacies. The continuity of structure is crucial to maintain a believable integration. The added elements appear to be well-aligned with the lampâ€™s existing proportions, fitting neatly within its original design, without any visible seams or mismatches. They flow smoothly along the armature, creating a cohesive visual experience. Image A, without these additions, featured a simple lamp design, allowing for a clear visual contrast in comparison.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the page edges of the open book display cog-like patterns that are integrated seamlessly into the paper texture without distorting the natural curl or layering of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are cog-like patterns integrated into the edges of the pages of the open book. The design must preserve the natural texture and appearance of layered paper. Upon inspection, the cog patterns smoothly blend into the paper's edges without compromising the organic curl or layering of the pages. This indicates a meticulous approach to integrate these designs harmoniously. Image A featured a simple book without these mechanical embellishments, providing a baseline for comparison.",

      "question": "Are the rivet patterns applied to the floral wallpaper evenly spaced and dimensionally consistent with the wall surface, without causing distortions in the flower shapes or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals alterations to the wallpaper in the form of added rivets, a typical steampunk motif. Rivets must be dimensionally consistent with the wall and spaced evenly to maintain a believable pattern. Upon inspection, the rivet patterns are indeed evenly spaced, adhering to the dimensional consistency of the wall surface, and there are no visible distortions affecting the flower shapes or shadows. Comparing with Image A, which had undisturbed wallpaper, these additions are a new design choice.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color tone of the edited elements (lamp, books, wallpaper) consistent with the original warm vintage palette, showing no abrupt shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images, A and B, feature a warm vintage palette which is crucial to maintaining thematic cohesion. Image B, despite the additions like gears, cogs, and rivets, maintains the same vintage color consistency as Image A. There are no abrupt shifts in hue or brightness, allowing the newer elements to blend seamlessly into the visual framework, preserving harmony throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the mechanical additions (cogs, gears, rivets) proportionally scaled and structurally anchored to existing surfaces, avoiding floating or misaligned components that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, mechanical elements such as cogs, gears, and rivets have been added as decorative features. These elements must adhere to the spatial logic in terms of proportions and anchoring. The cogs and gears are integrated into the lamp's armature and surface which align well with the lamp's existing structure, appearing proportional and logically situated. Similarly, the rivets on the background do not appear misaligned or floating, fitting consistently onto the surfaces. Image A had a simpler design that did not feature these additions and served as the original reference.",
