      "question": "Does the long silver hair flow naturally without clumping, floating unrealistically, or showing visible seams or rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver hair appears to flow naturally with no visible clumping, seams, or artifacts. The hair strands maintain a realistic density and direction, consistent with natural hair behavior in such settings. This is supported by observing the fine or detailed representation of hair through world knowledge—hair in a realistic animated scene usually shows individual strands with smooth transitions without harsh lines.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the velvet robe textured with soft, consistent pile and subtle sheen, and do the arcane symbols appear clearly engraved or embroidered without pixelation or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet robe in Image B shows a soft texture with a consistent pile and subtle sheen typical of velvet fabric, as known in world knowledge. The arcane symbols are clear, either engraved or embroidered, without pixelation or distortion, indicating high-quality rendering typical of detailed fantasy artworks. This analysis comes from observing the smoothness and clarity of textures which represent crafting techniques accurately.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the fur trim on the mantle have natural density, directionality, and shadowing, and does it seamlessly attach to the robe without gaps or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur trim displays natural density and directionality, with appropriate shadowing similar to real fur as understood from world knowledge. It is seamlessly attached to the robe without visible gaps or edges, indicative of high-quality detailing where finishing techniques are used to integrate fur with clothing smoothly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the staff held by the hand with five distinct fingers, natural curvature, and correct grip pressure, and do the runic engravings appear deeply carved with clear edges and consistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the staff held naturally by the hand, with five distinct fingers exhibiting natural curvature and grip pressure appropriate for holding an object. This is verified by looking at the finger shapes and positions, informed by anatomical knowledge. Runic engravings are deeply carved with clear edges and consistent lighting which matches known engraving techniques used in creating depth and clarity in carved designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scrolls and bubbling potions in the background positioned logically within a laboratory setting, with proper depth, lighting, and no floating or misaligned objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scrolls and potions are positioned logically within the context of a laboratory. They adhere to principles of depth and lighting expected in realistic settings, without any objects appearing misaligned or unsupported spatially. Proper laboratory arrangement is evidenced by typical scientific setups where items are organized to appear functional and consistent with real lab environments.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the character’s shadows match the light source direction in the laboratory background, and are there no floating or disconnected elements such as misplaced objects or unattached textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's shadows in Image B are consistent with the light source direction in the background, as inferred from observing the shadow cast alignment relative to light placement, typical in realistic scenes. Analysis shows no floating or disconnected elements which disrupt coherence, suggesting that textures and objects are correctly aligned as would be logically expected in integrated design principles.",
