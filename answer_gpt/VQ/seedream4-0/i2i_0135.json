      "question": "Does the right-side skier maintain a natural texture and appearance without visible artifacts where he appears to slide out of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right-side skier seems to be partially sliding out of the image frame. By closely analyzing this region, there are no visible artifacts or distortions that compromise the skier’s natural texture. The transition from the skier to the edge of the image appears smooth, without any abrupt visual errors. This conclusion is drawn from the observation that consistent colors and outlines are maintained, typical of a well-executed post-production effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural bending in the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observation of Image B shows that the right-side skier's body and skiing equipment retain their natural geometric shapes and proportions. There appears to be no distortion or bending that deviates from the original curvature and alignment of the skier's posture or equipment. This suggests that the editing effect was applied carefully to avoid any distortion of the shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shadow cast by the right-side skier remain consistent with the light source and appear naturally elongated or altered appropriately due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "According to Image B, the sunlight direction (coming from the top left) casts a consistent shadow for the right-side skier. The shadow’s shape and direction are coherent with the position of the skier and the assumed light source, following a natural path on the snow. Even with the sliding effect, the shadow appears accurately aligned without breaking the scene’s lighting logic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow texture around the right-side skier smooth and uninterrupted, without showing signs of unnatural blending or disruption from the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspection of Image B shows that the snow texture around the right-side skier is continuous and smooth. There's no abrupt change or overlay that would indicate unnatural blending or disruption. The snow maintains a consistent texture, akin to freshly plowed snow present in the rest of the image, corroborating a seamless blending effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details on the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis remain sharp and clear, without any blurring or loss of detail due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details on the right-side skier's gear, including clothing, ski poles, and skis, are clearly visible and retain sharpness. The evidence is in the visibility of folds in the clothing, the textures of the ski poles, and the detailed graphics on the skis. Despite the sliding effect, the skier's details are not compromised, indicating careful editing that preserves the original detailing.",
