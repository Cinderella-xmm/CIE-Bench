      "question": "Does the lacework on the dress retain its intricate details without appearing distorted or overly simplified in the 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lacework is converted into a simplified version consistent with the 3D cartoon style. While the original image may have more intricate and delicate details typical of real lace, the edited image adopts a smoother and less intricate representation. In 3D cartoon styles, details are often streamlined for simplicity and stylization, and this is evident in the lacework which appears basic and lacks the complexity of real lace.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the soft lighting applied evenly across the character card, ensuring that the dress's floral patterns and lace details are clearly visible without any harsh shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears soft and even, typical of cartoon styles, minimizing shadows and highlights to maintain clarity. However, the dress's lace details are overly simplified and the floral patterns are abstracted away in the 3D cartoon style, which limits their visibility. The lighting contributes to the clear visibility of the character's features without harsh shadows or highlights, but the softness also leads to a loss of detail in the dress patterns and lacework.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skill bars and attributes like [Grace +10] and [Etiquette +8] placed in a way that they do not overlap with the character's dress or other important visual elements, maintaining the card's clean layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skill bars and attribute texts are strategically placed to avoid overlapping with the character's dress or other key visuals. They are positioned in the card's corners and top areas where they are visible but do not interfere with the central character depiction. This arrangement maintains the card's clean layout and ensures a clear separation of the character and informational text.",

      "question": "Do the title banner and name tag have consistent fonts and styles that match the Victorian era, and are their shapes and sizes proportionate to the rest of the card?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a title banner and name tag designed with fonts and stylization that resemble Victorian-era aesthetics, emphasizing decorative curves and serif-style fonts. However, the banner and name tag are proportioned to fit the space available on the card without being overly large or small. They maintain design consistency with the characterâ€™s clothing era.",

      "question": "Does the background with warm tones and complementary designs enhance the Victorian lady's presence on the card without overpowering her figure or causing any visual clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background consists of warm tones that complement the character's persona without introducing excessive visual elements. The use of subtle gradients and smooth colors creates an environment that highlights the character while avoiding distractions. This ensures that the character remains the focal point of the card without any clutter.",
