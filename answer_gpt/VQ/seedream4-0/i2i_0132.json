      "question": "Do the hands and arms of both individuals maintain natural proportions and shapes without appearing distorted or having unnatural numbers of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands and arms of both individuals are drawn in an anime style, which often exaggerates certain features but maintains basic anatomical consistency. The proportions of their arms are balanced, and the hands appear to have the correct number of fingers. The drawing style is meant to capture dynamic motion rather than precise anatomical accuracy, yet it does not present any visual distortion or unnatural shapes.",

      "question": "Are the textures on the characters' clothes and the grass field preserved naturally without losing detail or creating unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is an anime-style illustration, where the focus is not on realistic textures but rather on simplified forms and vibrant colors. This style results in smoother surfaces and less detailed textures. While the textures on the characters' clothes and the grass field do not match the high detail level seen in realistic imagery, the representation in Image B aligns with typical anime aesthetics, without creating unnatural or disruptive patterns.",

      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image accurately reflect the original sunlight direction, maintaining shadow and highlight placements in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is conveyed using vibrant colors and simplified shading techniques typical of anime illustrations. The sunlight appears to come from the left, similar to Image A, with highlights and shadows appropriately placed on the characters and surroundings. The shadow directions and placement are consistent and support the perceived source of light, maintaining the feel of the original scene.",

      "question": "Is the positioning and trajectory of the frisbee in mid-air consistent with realistic motion, avoiding any apparent physical inaccuracies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the frisbee slightly above the two characters in a manner suggesting upward or idling motion. Its position is balanced, and the alignment between the frisbee's path and the characters' engagement with it illustrates plausible physical accuracy. This retains the playful dynamic captured in Image A and embodies a believable motion sequence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions and body postures of the characters align naturally with their dynamic poses and the context of playing frisbee, without any exaggerated or inconsistent distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B captures the characters in dynamic postures reflective of motion and interaction typical in a casual frisbee game. The facial expressions and body language appear animated yet proportionate to their playful interaction. Though anime styles might exaggerate for effect, there are no distortions or inconsistencies, blending well with the context of the activity.",
