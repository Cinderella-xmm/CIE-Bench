      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges and contours of the LEGO car body aligned with the original vehicle’s shape, with no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or warped sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO car is constructed to mirror the shape of the vehicle depicted in Image A. The design uses LEGO bricks, known for their precise, straight edges and ability to form regular patterns without gaps or warping. The car appears well-aligned, maintaining consistency in shape and contour as per the typical LEGO construction method. Therefore, there are no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or warped sections, indicating that the LEGO bricks follow the original vehicle's contours effectively.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red and blue translucent LEGO pieces positioned exactly where the original emergency lights were, and do they appear transparent rather than solid or discolored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red and blue translucent LEGO pieces are placed on the roof of the LEGO car, precisely where the emergency lights are situated on the original vehicle in Image A. LEGO often uses translucent bricks to mimic transparency, and these pieces appear consistent with this approach, maintaining their transparency and correct color placement, thereby accurately representing the positioning and appearance of the emergency lights.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the window areas of the LEGO car consist of solid beige bricks without any transparent or see-through elements, making them visually inconsistent with real-world windows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the windows of the LEGO car seem to be made from solid bricks, including both beige and clear pieces, but not exclusively beige, to maintain visibility through them similar to real car windows. Transparent or clear LEGO bricks simulate glass, which should allow visualization of an interior pillar; this aligns with the intent to replicate window transparency seen in real vehicles. Hence, they are not entirely beige, indicating an effort to mimic real-world windows more accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grille and wheel components built from small LEGO blocks that maintain the original patterns and shapes, with no missing, misaligned, or distorted pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grille and wheel areas of the LEGO car are constructed using smaller LEGO pieces to achieve detail. These components appear to capture the essential design pattern and shape of the original car visible in Image A. They are well-aligned and retain the visual essence without distortion, indicating no misalignment or missing blocks typically expected from a LEGO construction focused on replicating specific design elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO car resting on a flat, uniform matte gray surface with no visible seams, texture mismatches, or lighting inconsistencies compared to the car’s shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO car on a flat, matte gray surface, which appears consistent and smooth without seams or textures that might disrupt uniformity. The shadow of the LEGO vehicle aligns seamlessly with the surface, indicating that there are no notable lighting inconsistencies or texture mismatches relative to the LEGO car's shadow, thus contributing to a coherent and realistic presentation.",
