      "question": "Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines are thick and emphasize the comic style by outlining significant elements such as the player, basketball, hoop, and court. The lines are meant to exaggerate and create a sense of action. However, they should not cut into each element's form, but rather flow with the shapes, enhancing their definition for a comic effect. Upon close inspection, the outlines in Image B closely follow the contours of these elements, providing definition without overlap or cutting into the forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the playerâ€™s body or the basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Dynamic action lines in Image B are designed to convey motion and energy. They are typically positioned in a way that suggests movement or speed, often radiating from or trailing the moving objects. In this case, the lines accentuate the player's motion towards the hoop. Analysis confirms that these lines avoid cutting through the player's body or the basketball, thus maintaining clarity and focus on the main elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red and orange hues applied consistently across the image without causing visible color bleeding, banding, or loss of detail in areas such as the jersey fabric, skin tone, or wooden floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B makes use of red and orange hues to create a vibrant comic style, contributing to a dramatic effect. Consistent application of these colors is crucial for maintaining image quality and detail in critical areas such as textures. Upon evaluation, Image B shows a consistent and controlled use of these colors without noticeable bleeding or banding, ensuring details in the jersey, skin tones, and court flooring remain clear and distinct.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text overlay clearly legible, positioned outside the main subject area, and not covering any essential part of the player or basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text overlay 'FANTASY COURT SHOWDOWN' is positioned towards the top right, strategically placed to avoid interference with the main subject, which includes the player and the basketball. The text is bold and large, ensuring legibility. Its placement respects the composition by being away from the core action area, maintaining the focus on the dynamic pose of the player.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the comic panel border evenly drawn around the entire image, maintaining consistent thickness and not cropping any part of the player, hoop, or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A comic panel border serves to frame the image definitively and evenly. In Image B, the border encompasses the entire image, providing a clean separation from any text or extraneous elements. Examination of the border reveals it to be of consistent thickness, orderly framing the illustration without cropping. All essential elements like the player, hoop, and background remain within bounds.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers, correctly proportioned and naturally curved around the ball, with no extra digits or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of hands in animated or comic-style images often requires careful attention to detail for realism. In Image B, the player's hand clutching the basketball is scrutinized to confirm it has five fingers, all proportioned accurately to match the positioning and grip around the ball. There are no extra fingers or visible distortions, thus successfully maintaining anatomical correctness.",

      "question": "Is the basketball fully spherical with visible seam lines and no flattened or distorted regions despite the comic-style rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ball in a comic or animated style image should retain its three-dimensional aspect for realism and consistency with real-world objects. In Image B, the basketball appears fully spherical, and its lines are visible and well-defined, adhering to these style characteristics. There are no visible distortions or flattened areas despite the artistic rendering.",
