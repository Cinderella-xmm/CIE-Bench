      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the robot figures derived from the batteries have limbs and heads that are proportionally sized and attached in a way that maintains structural coherence with their original cylindrical form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot figures have been designed to show limbs and heads that maintain some coherence with their original cylindrical battery form. Analysis of the robots shows that while the figures now have limbs and heads, their torsos are reminiscent of a battery's cylindrical shape. This style of design is typical for transforming objects into humanoid forms, keeping some attributes of the original object to maintain coherence. Therefore, the heads and limbs are proportionately sized to the torso, ensuring a consistent design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the robot figures made from the batteries rendered with a consistent metallic texture that mimics copper and black materials without visible artifacts like checkerboard patterns or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robots display a consistent metallic texture, strongly mimicking copper and black materials similar to the original batteries. The surface appears smooth and reflective, with no visible artifacts such as checkerboard patterns or distortions. Such attributes help convey a high-quality depiction of metallic elements commonly associated with a futuristic or technological theme.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital cityscape background positioned behind the robot figures with correct layering, atmospheric gradient, and light source alignment that matches the direction of illumination on the robots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a digital cityscape background with good layering and light source alignment. The atmospheric gradient appears to transition smoothly, and the illumination direction on the robots seems consistent with the background lighting. These elements come together to create a coherent scene where both background and foreground are well integrated, reflecting common principles used in digital and sci-fi art to maintain consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the digital screen displaying “10 Years in Storage” seamlessly integrated into the scene with readable text, smooth edges, and ambient lighting that matches the sci-fi theme without pixelation or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital display of '10 Years in Storage' in Image B appears seamlessly integrated into the scene, featuring clear text and smooth edges. The ambient lighting complements the sci-fi theme, and there are no visible signs of pixelation or distortion. This suggests a high-quality digital render consistent with futuristic design choices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title \"Duracell Guardians: Power Preserve Adventures!\" displayed in a clean, bold, futuristic font with uniform stroke width and no visual artifacts like jagged edges or overlapping glyphs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title is displayed in a bold and clean font fitting the futuristic theme. The stroke width is uniform, and there are no visible visual artifacts such as jagged edges or overlapping glyphs, which would diverge from a professional, polished graphical appearance typical of commercial design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the robot figures, title, and digital screen arranged in a way that avoids overlapping text or important visual elements, ensuring all components are legible and distinct?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a well-arranged composition where the robot figures, the title, and the digital screen are positioned without overlapping important elements or text. This ensures that each component is distinct and legible, following common design principles for clarity and effective visual communication.",
