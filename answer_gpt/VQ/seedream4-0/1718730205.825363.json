      "question": "Are the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex continuous, following the curve without gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leadwork outlines that form the spiral pattern in the stained glass are consistently following the curvature of the spiral. The lines appear continuous without interruptions, ensuring the integrity of the stained glass design. The craftsmanship in stained glass often emphasizes smooth and contoured lines to maintain the overall aesthetic, which is evident here as there are no visible gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the jewel-toned colors applied to the sky and tree canopies transition smoothly without visible color banding or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used are rich and vivid, characteristic of jewel tones, especially in stained glass. The transitions between different colored segments, particularly in the sky and tree canopies, are gradual and smooth, as one would expect from high-quality stained glass work that avoids banding or patchy color areas. These transitions reflect expert design and craftsmanship aimed at achieving a harmonious and visually pleasing effect.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass textures applied uniformly across the spiral and trees, showing clear refraction effects without blurring or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The faceted glass texture in Image B is uniformly applied across the spiral and the trees. Each glass section is well-defined, with lines indicating individual glass pieces that exhibit clear refractive qualities, characteristic of stained glass art. There is no noticeable blurring or loss of detail, signifying high resolution and precision in the depiction of this textural effect, thus maintaining the visual clarity within the stained glass design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the leadwork lines form clean, unbroken borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without intersecting incorrectly or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the leadwork lines that encase the spiral, trees, and horizon consistently maintain clean and unbroken paths. These lines do not incorrectly intersect or form any 'floating' parts that are disjointed from the rest of the image. This coherence is key in traditional stained glass designs where each segment is cohesively held together by leadwork that doesn't compromise the integrity of the art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface still distinguishable and not obscured by the glass texture or color saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the stained glass texture introduces a new layer to the image, the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface remain distinguishable. The transparency and color saturation of the glass are controlled in such a way that maintains the visibility of these small features, crucial for the authenticity and aesthetic quality of stained glass art that seeks to depict detailed imagery.",
