      "question": "Do the refrigerator doors and handles appear proportionally correct and geometrically consistent with typical refrigerator designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the symmetry and alignment of the refrigerator doors and handles, they exhibit a proportional balance consistent with standard refrigerator designs. The handles are vertically aligned and equidistant from the center, which is typical for side-by-side refrigerator models. The size and shape of the doors do not display any unusual proportions, maintaining a conventional appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator free from unnatural textures, maintaining a consistent and authentic finish throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the refrigerators' metallic surfaces with a consistent brushed stainless steel finish, which is common for modern kitchen appliances. The lighting effects on the metallic surfaces appear smooth and natural, without any distortions or unnatural textures. This contributes to an authentic visual representation of stainless steel.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting appear uniform across both refrigerators, without noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is consistent across both refrigerators, with even distribution and no abrupt shadows or highlights that might distract or indicate editing anomalies. The surrounding environment, including the cabinets and counters, also reflects similar lighting conditions, reinforcing the uniformity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there smooth transitions where the refrigerators meet the cabinets, without visible seams or edges that break the visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions between the refrigerators and the adjacent cabinets are smooth and visually continuous. The design appears well-integrated, with no visible gaps or misalignments where they meet, maintaining a cohesive look typical of built-in kitchen appliances.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly defined and positioned appropriately, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly marked and systematically aligned with household appliance designs. Their placement is consistent and logical, typical of side-by-side refrigerator models, adding to the realistic representation of the appliances.",
