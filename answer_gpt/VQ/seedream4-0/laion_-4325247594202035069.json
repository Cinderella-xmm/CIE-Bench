    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures indeed appear to be covered in a soft fabric with visible texture that suggests a plush, tactile quality. The colors are bold and include blue, green, red, and yellow in non-repeating patterns, which give each figure a unique appearance. The surface appears consistent, without visible flaws such as seams or pixelation, which points to a cohesive design. This is likely a design choice to make them look like plush toys. Therefore, the surfaces of all four figures meet the described qualities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the figures indeed transform into exaggerated fins and tails, consistent with a fish or aquatic design theme. Despite the exaggerated features, the poses of the figures remain dynamic and well-structured, with no apparent breaks in geometry or unnatural bends, maintaining the sense of action and movement originally intended. This suggests careful design to preserve the original dynamism while altering the forms.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the weapons carried by the figures are incorporated into their new aquatic design as fins or tail extensions. Each weapon connects seamlessly to the figure, ensuring that components do not appear to float or be misaligned. These elements seem to be an integrated part of the figuresâ€™ anatomy, maintaining a sense of cohesion and physical logic within the reimagined aquatic theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B resembles a sandy fabric surface, characterized by texture and subtle depth provided by shading. The figures are placed in such a way that they seem to naturally rest upon the surface, with no evidence of floating or clipping issues. This contributes to the illusion that the figures are actually interacting with the sandy environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the concept of hands seems to be suitable for the plush theme, maintaining basic grip functions. While plush toys may not accurately mimic human anatomy with exact fingers, the grip features hold the integrated weapons naturally, and there are no visible signs of abnormality or extra digits in the context of their plush design. The figures visually comply with expected plush toy attributes.",
