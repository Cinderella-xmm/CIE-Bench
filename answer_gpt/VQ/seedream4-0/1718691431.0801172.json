      "question": "Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fox mask shows symmetrical and proportionate facial features. This is evident from the uniform placement of the eyes and the central alignment of the other elements. The ears show consistent patterns and the decorative elements are proportionate and aligned within the mask's design, which reflects artistic attention to detail without deformation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kimono in Image B features clear geometric motifs with consistent lines, contrasting the floral patterns observed in Image A. The geometric shapes are distinct and sharp, without signs of blurring or fragmentation, showing a deliberate change in design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono maintains a natural drape and fold structure, evident from the way it contours around the body without appearing flat or stretched unnaturally. The folds and fabric flow suggest an adherence to physical plausibility.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of both the fox mask and kimono in Image B are rendered smoothly without jagged edges, pixelation, or seams. This indicates a high-quality editing process that eliminates signs of editing errors or incomplete rendering.",
