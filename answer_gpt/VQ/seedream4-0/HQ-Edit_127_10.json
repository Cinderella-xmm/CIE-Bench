    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see an object that resembles a snow globe with two distinct sections: the upper and lower tiers. These tiers are visually separated by an ornate band, and each tier maintains its own scene, contributing to a clear definition. The perspective and scale within each tier appear consistent and proportional to the scenes depicted, emphasizing the layered structure of the object. This separation and definition suggest a distinct conceptual division between the two scenes, typical of a double snow globe design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buildings in the upper tier, including the Eiffel Towers and surrounding structures, exhibit a metallic sheen with reflections and gradients that align with the lighting in Image B. This is visible as the light source hits the structures, creating highlights and shadows that give depth and a realistic metallic effect consistent with real-world reflections. There are no flat or uniformly colored patches, indicating a well-executed rendering that takes lighting and material properties into account.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower tier in Image B features a landscape scene with trees and bushes. These elements have been constructed with irregular shapes, depicting natural variations in height and density that one would expect to see in a real forest or park setting. The design avoids repeating texture patterns or symmetry, which can often detract from a natural appearance, indicating careful attention to realism in the design of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flakes in Image B are distributed throughout the space in the upper tier of the snow globe. They have soft edges and a degree of blurring, which gives them a sense of depth and movement as one would expect from snow or glitter within a snow globe. This distribution and visual effect imply suspension in and movement through air, characteristic of a functioning snow globe mechanism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of Image B displays a detailed scene with cobblestones where each stone appears individually rendered, and the grout lines are visible. The texture of these cobblestones shows realistic surface variations, enhancing the scene's believability. The street lamps are proportionally sized relative to the scene and are placed evenly, contributing to a coherent and balanced aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both Eiffel Towers are depicted with accurate structural integrity. The lattice patterns are faithfully represented without variation, ensuring that they look uniform and true to the real Eiffel Tower design. There are no visible distortions such as stretches or compressions, maintaining the iconic appearance and proportions of the Eiffel Tower.",
