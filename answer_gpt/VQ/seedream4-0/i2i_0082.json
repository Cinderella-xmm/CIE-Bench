      "question": "Does the metallic texture of the badge appear natural without introducing any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic texture of the badge is crucial for evaluating its natural appearance. By visual inspection, the metallic surface of the keychain appears smooth and consistent without signs of pixelation or unnatural artifacts. The light and reflections behave according to expectations for polished metal, maintaining a realistic texture and detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular frame of the clock/badge perfectly round, without any visible geometric distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, observation of the circular frame of the badge indicates it maintains perfect roundness. There are no irregularities, bulges, or dents visible which would suggest geometric distortion. The visual cues confirm the circle's uniform shape, supporting a conclusion of no deformation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hour, minute, and second hands retain their original proportions and alignment, avoiding any distortion or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B allows for inspection of the clock hands: hour, minute, and second. They appear proportionate to previous knowledge of clock designs, showing no distortion or misalignment. Their alignment seems precise, maintaining clear distinctions suitable for time representation, and reinforcing a well-aligned configuration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any inconsistent shadows or reflections on the metallic badge that contradict its physical placement as a keychain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The assessment of Image B involves evaluating shadows and reflections which should be coherent with the physical placement of the keychain. The shadows are soft and congruent with the lighting conditions, and reflections on the metallic surface appear consistent with expectations for a polished metal object without conflicting placements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the border thickness and surface finish of the metallic badge consistent and detailed enough to maintain the image's overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the border of the metallic badge is analyzed for thickness and surface finish. These elements seem uniform and adequately detailed when viewed, contributing to a realistic portrayal of the object. The finish is polished, enhancing the authenticity of the metal representation and supporting a natural observation experience.",
