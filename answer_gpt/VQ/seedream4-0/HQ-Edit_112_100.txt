    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is crafted in a way that demonstrates transparency and smooth curvature, with the eagle and clouds inside visible without distortion. The reflective nature and realistic appearance are achieved through careful rendering of light refraction, meaning the glass contributes to amplifying the display rather than altering it. Combining visual cues with common sense, this setup implies a well-designed enclosure with no disruptive visual impacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature clouds are sculpted to appear three-dimensional, with lighting and texture mimicking real cloud formations. While crafted from materials different from water vapor, the design adapts the shapes and lighting to closely replicate clouds' natural appearance. Observing their shadowing and positioning suggests an alignment with realistic cloud portrayal despite the medium change.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf is not applied on the clouds but rather on the eagle itself. The gold leaf detailing on the eagle is subtle, providing a reflective metallic texture that enhances its appearance without overwhelming the natural design of the eagle or creating harsh contrasts with the representation of clouds. Therefore, referring strictly to the cloud depiction and its details regarding gold leaf application would be inaccurate if strictly observing it as part of the cloud's artistic element.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dark wood base exhibits a polished finish that replicates the natural wood texture effectively, with the text clearly engraved and visible, 'Noble Sky Guardian'. The base proportions align smoothly with the dome, implying stability and integration. This observation suggests the craftsmanship of the base, enhancing the decorative ensemble’s cohesion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brass compass roses are shown surrounding the base, and they appear evenly spaced and properly shaped, with a metallic texture that matches the realistic appearance of brass. Their scale relative to the base and dome maintains a proportional harmony, enhancing the decorative theme without suggesting an imbalance. Therefore, they are rendered aptly alongside the primary showcase element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
