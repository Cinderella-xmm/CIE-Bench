      "question": "Do the blue dragons' scales seamlessly integrate with the bowl's blue floral design without appearing as unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue dragons have distinct scales that contrast with the bowl's blue floral design. The scales are more textured and three-dimensional compared to the flat floral pattern of the bowl. The dragons introduce a fantasy element that is visually separated from the bowl's design, indicating it may not seamlessly integrate with the existing textures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the wisps of orange smoke naturally integrated into the scene, complementing the curry without looking out of place or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange wisps appear as smoke emanating from the center of the dish. They are thin and dispersed, suggesting they are separate from the solid curry. Given the unusual context of dragons and eggs in curry, the smoke adds an unnatural element that doesn't align with typical food presentations.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dragon eggs retain the shape and texture of the original chicken pieces, ensuring they look like solidified curry without losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B with Image A, the dragon eggs have distinct characteristics with a scaly texture and metallic sheen that contrasts with the smooth and sauce-covered texture of the chicken pieces in curry. The sizes and shapes of the eggs do not match the original pieces, leading to a loss of the fine details found in the food item.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the blue dragons positioned naturally above the dragon eggs, maintaining a playful yet coherent interaction without breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue dragons are placed atop the eggs with a positioning that appears dynamic due to their stance and proportions. This placement, while fantastical, maintains coherence by showing the dragons in contact with the eggs, contributing to a whimsical and imaginative scene despite its unrealistic nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the edited image, including the transformed cilantro, dragon eggs, and smoke, maintain a natural and authentic appearance without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features drastic transformations, such as cilantro replaced with dragons, chicken pieces turned into dragon eggs, and smoke added to the scene. These edits introduce fantasy elements that break natural authenticity. The dragons and eggs stand out prominently from the original culinary context, introducing noticeable artifacts.",
