    "Question": "Q1: Does the golden butterfly appear naturally lit and integrated into the scene without disrupting the existing light sources?",
    "explanation": "The golden butterfly is positioned above the mirror where there is already ambient lighting from the mirror's backlight. The butterfly appears to catch this ambient light naturally, contributing to a cohesive look. It does not cast additional shadows or disrupt the lighting as perceived visually. The lighting on the butterfly complements the warm light from the mirror, maintaining an integrated look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the material and texture of the golden butterfly consistent with the surrounding surfaces, avoiding any visible unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The texture of the golden butterfly appears smooth and reflective, consistent with a metallic or translucent material. This complements the matte and glossy finishes of surfaces in the space like the mirror and walls. There is no jarring texture that stands out as incongruent in this modern and polished setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the shape of the golden butterfly structurally coherent and free from distortion, maintaining proper geometry as it appears above the mirror?",
    "explanation": "The butterfly maintains a typical lepidopteran symmetry, with even and undistorted wings, suggesting proper geometry. In interior design, symmetrical and coherent shapes contribute to aesthetic harmony, fitting well with the structured elements in the scene like the circular mirror.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the position of the golden butterfly above the mirror contribute positively to the overall composition without creating visual discontinuity?",
    "explanation": "Positioned above the mirror, the butterfly's placement seems intentional, adding an element of whimsical detail without overpowering the central features of the bathroom. The slightly off-center positioning aligns with design principles that favor asymmetry for visual interest, blending into the vertical lines created by the sconce lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the golden butterfly been preserved, ensuring clarity and sharpness in comparison to the rest of the image?",
    "explanation": "The details on the golden butterfly, such as the edges and any potential patterns, appear clear and sharp, comparable to other elements within the high-resolution image. The preservation of these details ensures that the butterfly does not appear blurred or dull against the rest of the image, contributing to its effective integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
