      "question": "Are the enlarged knitting needles proportionally consistent with the size of the woman's hands and aligned naturally with her fingers without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles appear proportionally consistent with the woman's hands. They align naturally with her fingers, considering the typical way knitting needles are held, without any obvious bending or unnatural stretching evident. This realistic depiction suggests a good understanding of the proportion and natural alignment when knitting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the steam lines above the teacup rise smoothly from the rim in a continuous, curved pattern without sharp breaks or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam lines above the teacup rise in a fluid, continuous manner which resembles natural steam. The curves are smooth, and there are no abrupt angles, which commonly occur in natural steam patterns, maintaining an authentic appearance as per real-world steam behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transformed yarn pattern on the fabric retain consistent knit stitches and natural thread flow without visible pixelation or irregular textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yarn pattern appears consistent with natural knit stitches seen in real-life knitting projects. The texture follows a regular, expected flow for knitted fabric, showing no pixelation or irregularities that would create an unnatural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the writing panel positioned within the open book pages such that its edges align naturally with the page boundaries and the knitted border matches the texture and color of the surrounding fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the writing panel in the open book is well-positioned within the page boundaries. The edges are aligned correctly with the book's pages, and the knitted border around the text appears to match the fabric's texture and color, maintaining cohesion between the elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the added lamplight effect produce a gradual glow around the book and cup without creating unnatural bright spots or conflicting shadows on the armchair or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamplight effect is added around the book and cup in a way that produces a soft, gradual glow typical of such light sources. The illumination does not create bright spots or cast conflicting shadows, making it integrative with the existing lighting environment without disrupting the scene's natural lighting harmony.",
