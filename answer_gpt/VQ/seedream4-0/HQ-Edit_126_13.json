      "question": "Do the annotated lines representing the tea journey follow a smooth, non-intersecting path around the tea set without overlapping or deforming the original objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the annotated lines representing the tea journey form a continuous path around the tea set, following a smooth and clear trajectory. These lines do not intersect each other and do not overlap or deform any original object such as the teapot or cup. Visual examination shows the path is maintained skillfully around the objects, indicating intentional design to keep the flow smooth and uninterrupted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the handwritten calligraphy in soft pastel green seamlessly integrated into the scene without causing visual contrast or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten calligraphy is applied in a soft pastel green. This choice of color is subtle and blends well with the earthy and muted tones of the overall image. The text stands out enough to be readable but does not create harsh visual contrast or intersect poorly with the textures of the underlying objects, suggesting a seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the minimalist icons for each step of the tea journey proportionally scaled and visually coherent with the surrounding objects and layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minimalist icons in Image B are added around the objects and appear to be proportionally scaled in relation to the tea set and other accessories on the table. The placement of these icons follows a logical order along the trajectory of the annotated lines and complement the layout without appearing disproportionate or out of place, demonstrating visual coherence.",

      "question": "Do the added cherry blossom petals appear to float or fall naturally in the air without unnatural positioning or missing shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the cherry blossom petals are added to appear as if they're gently falling and floating, mimicking natural movement. They are positioned appropriately in the air with variations to suggest depth and motion, and do not show any evidence of unnatural placement such as misaligned shadows or awkward grouping, maintaining visual authenticity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase preserved without visible distortion, blurring, or artificial seams where new elements were added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B for any distortion or blending issues from the added elements, the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase are preserved. The mat's intricacy and the surface texture of the other objects remain intact without visible blurring or artificial lines at the juncture of the added annotations, indicating careful editing to maintain the visual integrity of the original scene.",
