      "question": "Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tabletop features a metallic surface with intricately detailed engravings. The surface shows a consistent metallic sheen which is typical for polished metal materials, suggesting the engravings are sharp and well-defined without any blurred or jagged edges. Visually, it's evident that the craftsmanship in the tabletop is refined with no apparent imperfections in the engravings.",

      "question": "Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple piston-driven limbs extending from the central column which are arranged symmetrically around it. The limbs match in proportion to the central column, indicating they are scaled appropriately. The joints in the piston limbs are clearly defined, and there are no visible bent or broken segments, suggesting a precise industrial design often seen in machinery.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central column in Image B features steam vents which appear to be evenly spaced. These vents are embedded directly into the metal surface, evident by their alignment with the cylindrical shape of the column, providing a seamless integration rather than appearing detached or misaligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base shows cog patterns and dials that maintain intact geometric shapes. The spacing between each element is uniform, reflecting careful arrangement commonly seen in mechanical structures. There is no evidence of overlapping or incomplete features which could indicate any design flaws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image reveals clear differentiation between brass, copper, and silver components. Brass and copper parts exhibit a warmer hue and distinct reflectivity compared to the cool tone of silver. This differentiation ensures the accents are distinct, without any unnatural gradients or texture artifacts which would disrupt the aesthetic quality.",
