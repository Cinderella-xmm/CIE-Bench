      "question": "Does the cylindrical glass body maintain consistent curvature and transparency, with the embossed patterns clearly visible and proportionally scaled across the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the glass body of the bottle is cylindrical with smooth, consistent curvature typical for such containers. The glass's transparency is preserved, allowing the rich amber color of the liquid inside to be visible. The embossed patterns are clearly discernible and show intricate details that suggest a high level of craftsmanship. They are proportionally integrated into the design, indicating an intentional and uniform scale across the surface. Such design is common in premium spirit bottles where aesthetics play a significant role.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the label \"Timeless Reserve\" centered within the circular area, with Roman numerals uniformly positioned along its perimeter and matching the font style and size of the original clock face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visual inspection of Image B, the label 'Timeless Reserve' is centered within what resembles a clock face on the bottle. The Roman numerals are arranged symmetrically around the perimeter, maintaining consistent spacing and alignment that reflects careful design. The font style of the numerals is clear and bold, paralleling that of traditional clock faces, though the size and style are adapted slightly to fit the branding of the bottle label.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the top ring now resemble a functional bottle cap with a cork stopper that has a natural porous texture, and are the gold accents seamlessly integrated without visible seams or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top features a ring that, upon inspection, resembles a bottle cap structure with a cork stopper. The cork displays a natural porous texture typical of wine or spirit bottle stoppers, lending authenticity to its appearance. The gold accents around the neck and the stopper are integrated seamlessly, without any abrupt transitions or visible seams. The lighting across these accents is even, reflecting natural illumination consistent with the scene's direction, suggesting a well-executed digital edit.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental scrollwork patterns preserved with full depth and clarity across the curved glass surface, showing no signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scrollwork patterns on the bottle's surface are rich and clear. The depth and detail seen in these patterns illustrate craftsmanship without any distortion. There are no signs of stretching or compression, and the integrity of the texture is maintained. This suggests that the edit preserved the dimensionality and intricate design typical for decorative glassware, avoiding common editing pitfalls like pixelation or distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glass bottle align with the lighting direction of the scene, and are there no visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities at the boundaries between the bottle and the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the reflections and shadows on the bottle are consistent with the light source apparent in the scene. The lighting's direction aligns logically with the reflections present, enhancing the realism of the image. No visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities are evident at the junction between the bottle and the wooden background. Such alignment and seamless integration are crucial for maintaining visual coherence in edited images.",
