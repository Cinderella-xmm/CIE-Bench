      "question": "Are the beach-themed stickers on the capybara's beanie clearly visible and seamlessly blended into the knit fabric without any jagged edges or texture distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stickers on the capybara's beanie are clearly visible and appear to be integrated into the overall design without any jagged edges or texture distortions. The stickers are designed to appear as part of the beanie's aesthetic, suggesting a high-quality, seamless edit. Typically, poorly integrated elements would show mismatches in texture or noticeable borders, which are not present here. This indicates a deliberate and careful placement of the stickers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color of the beanie and the beverage uniformly saturated without unnatural color bleeding or digital halos around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue color of both the beanie and the beverage appears evenly saturated, with no signs of color bleeding or digital halos that would suggest a poor digital edit. The uniformity of the color suggests that the saturation was applied consistently, maintaining clean edges and preventing any halo effect, which is a common issue when color alterations are not applied with precision.",

      "question": "Does the arched typography sit correctly above the Opera House without distorting its shape or creating visual inconsistencies in scale and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arched typography at the top of the image is well-positioned above the Opera House without distorting its shape or causing any inconsistencies in scale and depth. The text is designed to curve gently, maintaining readability and visual harmony with the background scene. This correct placement and scaling suggest a careful consideration of the composition.",

      "question": "Does the capybaraâ€™s hand holding the drink have five fingers with natural spacing, ergonomic curvature, and realistic texture without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's hand holding the drink possesses four visible fingers, which is typical as capybaras have four, not five, toes on their front feet. The fingers display natural spacing and curvature, consistent with an anthropomorphized character, and the texture appears realistic. There is no distortion or presence of extra digits that would create an unnatural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and reflections on the capybara, the drink, and the water surface align consistently with the direction of the sunset in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the capybara, the drink, and the water surface aligns with the direction of the sunset, which suggests light emanating from the left side of the image (where the sun is setting). The reflections and shadows seem naturally placed, maintaining consistency with the perceived light source in the background, which enhances the realism of the scene.",
