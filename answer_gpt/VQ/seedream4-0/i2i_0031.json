      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifeguard tower and rescue vehicle, while simplistic and graphic, appear isolated and abstract from any intricate background, which suggests intentional design and prevents potential incongruities with an overly detailed scene. The use of primary colors and flat design, typical in graphic iconography or signage, aids in this seamless integration without disrupting the visual authenticity.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a style shift from realism to minimalism, where iconographic design does not emphasize intricate details but rather focuses on essential shape and color blocks.
