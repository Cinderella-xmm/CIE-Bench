      "question": "Do the black-and-white coat patterns on the chibi cow match the original cow's patterns without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cow features black and white patches akin to traditional Holstein cows, reflecting typical cow patterns. Upon comparing it with Image A, the original cow also shows irregularly shaped black patches on a white body.

      "question": "Does the positioning of the cow leaning against the vintage television with its hooves on the screen look natural and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cow is positioned with its front hooves on top of the vintage television, resembling a playful pose often seen in animated characters. The body balance and positioning, considering the character's stylized and exaggerated features, appear consistent and expected for an animated setting. The original cow in Image A does not display this playful interaction, but in the chibi form, this pose is cohesive with the whimsical theme.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cow displays an exaggerated smile, common in cartoon depictions for creating expressive and exaggerated emotional states.

      ],
