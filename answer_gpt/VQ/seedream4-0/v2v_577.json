      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and evenly distributed, with a gradient background that transitions smoothly from light to dark. This enhances the display of the scene within the glass cube, providing a contrast that brings out the shapes and colors without creating any shadows or highlights that appear unnatural. The arrangement creates a visually appealing and authentic representation, devoid of any glaring artifacts or inconsistencies.",
