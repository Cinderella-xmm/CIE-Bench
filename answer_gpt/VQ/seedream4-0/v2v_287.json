      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the 3D voxel model of the train maintain its original shape and proportions, avoiding any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe the train is designed in a voxel style, which inherently uses blocky, pixelated shapes. Despite this stylization, the train retains a coherent overall shape resembling that of a modern train, with recognizable elements like the nose, headlights, and overall body. The proportions appear consistent, with no apparent distortion relative to traditional voxel art which doesn't directly compromise structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the train's surface, such as windows and lights, clear and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B, depicted in a voxel style, shows clear details such as windows and headlights, which are presented in blocky forms typical of voxel art. However, these are clear and fit the stylized theme, avoiding textures that seem unnatural or misplaced within the context of voxel design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and colors of the 3D voxel model train match the style of the icons, ensuring a natural and consistent appearance with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The use of simple, solid colors and simplified forms in Image B is typical of voxel art style. The train's colors and materials are consistent with the rest of the environment's voxel model, ensuring a coherent visual style as the whole image adopts this blocky aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the 3D voxel model train and the real-world elements seamless, without introducing any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although real-world elements like the station have also been voxelized, the train integrates well into the platform environment. There are no visible artifacts disrupting the flow between the train and its surroundings, and the overall theme maintains consistency without discrepancies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement and orientation of the 3D voxel model train within the station platform appear natural and consistent with the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D voxel model train in Image B is well-positioned on the tracks with a natural alignment consistent with the station's layout. It maintains a coherent placement and direction as expected in a real-world train scene, adjusted into the voxel style without introducing inconsistency concerning the environment.",
