      "question": "Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is depicted as elongated and attached to the head naturally. The beak is straight and connects seamlessly to the head without any visible bends or breaks at the base. The cartoonish nature of the depiction maintains the structural integrity of the beak since it resembles a typical exaggerated style seen in animated or stylized designs. This is consistent with the visual cues concerning animal anatomy, even in a stylized form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's feathers show a layered texture achieved through various pastel colors, creating overlapping sections that suggest depth and detail. The pastel coloring adds artistic flair, but the variance in shades, especially in the wings, indicate layering rather than uniform smoothness or pixelation. This stylized texture is typical in illustrative designs, maintaining both detail and aesthetic appeal.",

      "question": "Is the sailor hat positioned securely on the pelican’s head without overlapping the neck or appearing detached from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sailor hat in Image B is securely placed on the pelican's head, with its base sitting flush atop the head. It doesn’t overlap with the neck, nor does it appear detached, consistent with a conventional hat position on animated characters. The design ensures that the hat's placement looks naturally integrated with the pelican's head structure, typical of a consistent cartoon illustration.",

      "question": "Does the wooden plank background extend evenly behind the pelican without visible seams or inconsistencies in wood grain or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B consists of wooden planks that extend evenly, showcasing consistent wood grain and maintaining coherence in lighting. There are no visible seams or irregularities that would break the uniformity of the background, suggesting a smooth single-layer image typically used in design art to create a clean, uniform backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s legs and feet proportionally aligned with the body and not distorted or bent in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's legs and feet appear proportionate to the body and are illustrated without distortion or unnecessary bending. They maintain reasonable anatomical placement, corresponding with the body size and style details observed in cartoon depictions, where proportions are respected despite artistic liberties.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the pelican appear as a flat, two-dimensional object with minimal depth cues and clean edges, consistent with a magnet design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pelican in Image B presents itself as a flat, two-dimensional illustration, with clear, unbroken edges, characteristic of a magnet or sticker design. The lack of shading and depth cues strengthens the flat appearance, emphasizing a clean contrast between the image and its background, satisfying the criteria for a typical product design of this nature.",
