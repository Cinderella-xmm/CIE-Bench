      "question": "Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the pig appears proportionately large compared to the body. The neck and shoulder areas show no visible distortions or unnatural seams. The proportions have been maintained, suggesting a coherent design where the larger head fits naturally with the body and attire. This is depicted through the smooth transition from the head to the body, indicating a deliberate caricature style rather than a fault in rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig is depicted with its face blurred, thus no green sunglasses are visible or evaluated. Considering the description requires a clear comparison of this feature, there's no visible cue in the edited image ensuring that the analysis of their consistency can't be performed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s hands on the turntable appear to be rendered with hooves or three fingers, rather than anatomically correct five fingers as might be expected from a fictional anthropomorphized portrayal. The design choice matches typical stylized animal anatomy rather than realistic human-like hands, showing natural spacing and curvature that align with the stylized portrayal of a pig.",

      "question": "Does the watercolor background integrate smoothly with the pig and DJ equipment, showing no abrupt edges or conflicting lighting patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor background blends seamlessly with the illustrated pig and DJ equipment. The colors transition smoothly, integrating soundwaves and patterns fluidly with the rest of the composition. No harsh edges or conflicting lighting patterns are evident, indicating a coherent and intentional artistic design that complements the illustration style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chat bubbles and surrounding soundwave patterns clearly defined, free of jagged edges, and positioned without obstructing key features like the face or turntable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chat bubbles and soundwave patterns are clearly defined and positioned around the pig and DJ equipment. They are free of jagged edges and designed to integrate within the scene. The positioning does not obstruct key features, as they are intentionally placed surrounding the main elements like the pig’s outfit and microphone, ensuring that both the artistic intent and narrative features remain visible.",
