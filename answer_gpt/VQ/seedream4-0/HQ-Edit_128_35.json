      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter's keyboard area must have keys in a typical uniform layout commonly seen in traditional typewriters, with regular spacing indicative of functional design. The typewriter's body should visually portray a rectangular shape typically associated with typewriter design without any distortions or missing segments. Based on the image, the preservation of the typewriter's form and keyboard layout appears to be intact, suggesting that both the shape and structure are coherent without noticeable warps or parts absent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Tales Untold' is analyzed based on its placement relative to the typewriter and overall notebook cover design. It is positioned at the top of Image B, not interfering with the key functions or paper area, suggesting deliberate positioning for clear readability. The text's horizontal alignment is consistent with the notebook's orientation, indicative of conventional design where titles are centrally placed for balance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows ink splatters with random placement and varying sizes typical of accidental spills, having soft and organic edges which avoid intrusion on the typewriter keys or paper area. This irregular scattering and non-obscuring nature of splatters suggest intentional artistic effect, not compromising structural visibility or functionality of depicted objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marbled background is examined for consistency, seeking uninterrupted continuation beneath the notebook cover seen in Image B. No gaps, clipping, or harsh color transitions are evident, maintaining a uniform marbled aesthetic edging indicating seamless design typical for such background patterns ensuring aesthetic cohesion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather spine is inspected for consistent texture indicative of real leather with subtle color differences. The embossed icons appear well spaced, accurately formed, with shading suggesting a three-dimensional quality as typical in embossed designs meant to add tactile depth and sophistication to leather-bound items.",
