    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the feathers exhibit smooth, continuous gradients of fiery coloration without visible banding, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers are adorned with fiery colors, blending seamlessly to create a vivid representation that mimics actual flame, without visible banding or abrupt color shifts. The use of gradient colors is applied smoothly over the feathered surface, helping the transition from one hue to another to appear natural. Thus, the fiery coloration in the feathers exhibits a smooth gradient without visible pixelation or abrupt color changes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the tail smoothly transform into smoke-like tendrils without abrupt cutoffs or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail in Image B merges into ethereal, smoke-like tendrils that extend smoothly from the feathered base. The depiction avoids abrupt cutoffs or discontinuities, suggesting a cohesive transformation into a smoke-like form. World knowledge informs that successful portrayal of continuity implies gentle curves and connections within the visual representation, which is evident here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the molten gold accents seamlessly blended into the wing and crest surfaces, showing depth and reflection consistent with metallic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, molten gold accents are visible on the wings and crest. These accents integrate into the surfaces smoothly, portraying reflections and depth typically associated with metallic materials. World knowledge about metallic textures indicates a blend of reflective and varied shading to achieve a realistic effect, which is present in the wing and crest surfaces here.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the flame-like eyes maintain the original eye shape and size, with no distortion of the surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flame-like eyes in Image B retain a shape and size that are similar to typical roosters, aligning well with the surrounding facial features. The energy and light effects are maintained without distorting the facial structure. Comparing with Image A, the rooster's eye placement and proportion are preserved, showing consistency without affecting other features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the rune patterns clearly visible but not oversized or warped, preserving the natural shape and texture of the talons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays rune patterns on the talons that are visible and do not appear oversized or warped, allowing the natural form and texture of the talons to be preserved. The runes incorporate into the talons with an appropriate size that maintains anatomical accuracy and consistency with the image's art style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the rooster’s body posture and limb alignment preserved, with no stretching, compression, or misplacement of limbs relative to the torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves the body posture and limb alignment of the rooster, with features indicating proper anatomical proportions and alignment relative to the torso. This preservation maintains the natural stance, which suggests continuity from the original rooster in Image A, avoiding any stretching, compression, or misplacement.",
