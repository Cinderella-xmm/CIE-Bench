      "question": "Are the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel evenly spaced, angularly consistent, and free from jagged edges or irregularities that suggest distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chevron pattern is consistently spaced with each line parallel to the others, maintaining angular consistency. There are no visible jagged edges or distortions that would indicate any form of digital artifacting. The pattern appears uniform and smooth, which suggests careful design and editing to preserve the integrity of the pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold zippers retain their linear definition and proper placement along the seams, with no misalignment or broken segments suggesting artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold zippers retain their straight edges and linear continuity across the seams. There are no broken segments or misalignments visible that would suggest digital artifacting. The zippers appear properly placed and maintain their definition, indicating a well-executed editing process.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the olive tone applied uniformly across the surface of the bag, with no patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation that suggests digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a uniform olive tone across the bag. There are no noticeable patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistencies in saturation that would typically point to digital artifacts. The color is evenly applied, suggesting a high-quality image without such imperfections.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank message area on the back of the postcard aligned with the dimensions of the front design, with straight edges and no visible warping or layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blank message area on the postcard is properly aligned with the dimensions of the front design. The edges are straight, with no warping or layering errors observable. This alignment suggests accuracy in the design layout and implies no distortions or errors in the editing process.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the black portfolio contain the postcard with proper depth and alignment, showing no clipping, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the postcard is nested within the black portfolio, with consistent shadows and an alignment that suggests proper depth. There are no visible clipping issues, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps that would imply errors in alignment or layering. The image portrays a realistic inclusion of the postcard within the portfolio.",
