      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot under the glass dome appears smaller compared to its depiction in Image A. The scaling down process retains the teapot's original shape, detailed engravings, and structural coherence, as it mirrors the intricate patterns and design seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are symmetrically arranged around the base, ensuring a balanced, non-overlapping presentation. The cups exhibit realistic ceramic characteristics, evident through the reflection and shadow displayed on the mirrored surface beneath them.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the new engravings on the elevated surface match the existing decorative patterns in style and depth, without appearing pixelated, duplicated, or unnaturally enhanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases engravings on the elevated surface that harmonize with the existing style and depth of decorative patterns on the teapot. The consistency of the intricate detailing across the teapot suggests no signs of pixelation, duplication, or unnatural enhancement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the steam spirals rise smoothly from the teapotâ€™s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft edges, proper translucency, and consistent lighting interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam spirals in Image B rise smoothly, with soft edges and suitable translucency. They interact consistently with the lighting environment, enhancing the realism of the scene without abrupt transitions in texture or appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome demonstrates accurate light refraction and reflections that facilitate clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements. The absence of distortion or artificial glare ensures the clarity and realism of the display.",
