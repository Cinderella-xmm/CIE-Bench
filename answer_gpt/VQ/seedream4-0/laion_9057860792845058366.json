    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the reflections on the robot’s body uniform and physically consistent with a metallic surface, without streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlight areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot displays a metallic surface with smooth, uniform reflections. The highlights align with what is typically expected from a polished metal surface, featuring consistent sheen and no visible streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlights. This reflects an understanding of how light interacts with metallic surfaces, providing an impression of realism in the image.",

      "question": "Is the holographic display on the chest transparent and layered above the surface without warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display in Image B appears slightly raised above the robot's chest and maintains transparency, allowing for the underlying surface details of the armor to remain visible. There are no visual signs of warping or clipping with the surrounding armor, which indicates that the holographic effect is properly layered and integrated into the image without inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the control icons in the digital interface overlay sharp, readable, and positioned without overlapping key mechanical components such as the shoulders or torso joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the control icons in the digital interface are distinct and legible, maintaining an appropriate distance from the structural components of the robot. The placement ensures they do not overlap with critical mechanical parts like the shoulders or joints, allowing them to stand out clearly against the dark background with precise and readable symbols.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm without bending or deforming the arm’s structure, and does it have a clean, seamless connection point consistent with magnetic attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smartwatch in Image B appears attached to the robot's forearm without distorting its natural form. The attachment looks smooth, suggesting a seamless connection as if magnetically coupled, without any visible gaps or distortions that would imply a forceful or awkward fit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floating tech interface symbols in the background evenly spaced, sharp-edged, and free from jagged outlines or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tech interface symbols floating in the background are well defined, with sharp and clean edges. They are evenly distributed across the space, avoiding any crowding or uneven spacing. The absence of jagged outlines or ghosting contributes to a crisp and polished appearance, indicating precise rendering of these elements.",
