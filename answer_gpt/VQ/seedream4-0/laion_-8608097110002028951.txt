    "Question": "Q1: Does the facade of the theater building appear composed of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents, without visible seams, irregular patterns, or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facade is constructed using LEGO bricks, which are inherently uniform and modular. The tan LEGO bricks create a consistent structure with rows and columns, and brown accents divide elements like window frames and trim. LEGO bricks characteristically have a smooth and regular texture without visible seams like traditional building materials. This supports the appearance of uniformity without irregular patterns, as LEGO pieces interlock neatly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the three large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes that preserve the arch shape but feature a regular grid pattern, without distortion or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows are made up of LEGO bricks, transforming the original arched design into an arch shape using square blocks arranged systematically, forming a regular grid. LEGO designs allow the pieces to align seamlessly, which eliminates any distortion or misalignment present in more irregular structures. This structured pattern maintains the integrity of the original arch design with straightforward LEGO shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" signs show letters constructed from smooth red flat LEGO bricks, maintaining legibility and alignment with the awning structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the signs for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' are crafted from LEGO blocks with letters that appear smooth and flat due to the nature of LEGO design. This construction allows for uniformity and alignment, as LEGO bricks make it easier to place letters onto flat surfaces consistently without misalignment. This setup ensures legibility as LEGO brick manipulation can simulate printing effectively on signs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles with simplified shapes, including rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces, without retaining realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome trim?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both vintage cars are converted into LEGO models, which results in blocky, simplified designs typical of LEGO vehicles. These versions use rectangular shapes for bodies and flat surfaces, and LEGO wheels naturally have a circular form without complex automotive details like curved fenders or chrome trim found in real cars. By simplifying cars to a block-style representation, realistic features are lost and replaced with analogous LEGO elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the LEGO-style cars and building maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment, with no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO-style building and cars are rendered with proper scale and alignment typical of LEGO setup where modular design ensures consistent proportions. The LEGO features like interlocking bricks prevent floating parts or misalignment. This creates a cohesive scene where the cars and theater align with each other and the street environment without unnatural gaps, due to the systematic configuration inherent in LEGO designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
