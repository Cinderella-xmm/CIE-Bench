        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine of Bulbasaur appears to have a consistent texture typical of soft vinyl materials, characterized by smoothness and uniform coloration.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The proportions and placement seem natural and coherent within the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green plants appear well-integrated into the scene. Their natural textures and shapes are consistent with real indoor plants, and they harmonize with the furniture and the figurine without any abrupt transitions or artificial appearances. The lighting on the plants corresponds with the rest of the scene, further promoting a cohesive visual blending.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tea utensils in Image B are realistically sized relative to the figurine and the coffee table. Their position next to the figurine does not disrupt the overall scene but complements the domestic setting. This proportion and arrangement support a balanced visual composition, contributing positively by adding depth and interest without overpowering other elements.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a scene where all elements, including the figurine, tea set, table, and plants, appear naturally composed without visible distortions or artifacts that could distract from a realistic portrayal. The clean lines, appropriate lighting, and color consistency all contribute to an image that maintains a natural appearance without any notable flaws or visual errors.",
