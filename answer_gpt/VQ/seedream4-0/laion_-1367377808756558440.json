    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass finishes on the ship's hull and superstructure appear carefully crafted, resembling the metallic sheen and reflective qualities typical of polished brass. The texture is consistent throughout, indicating a thoughtful application of shading and lighting effects. No visible cracks or pixelation disrupt the surface, suggesting high-quality digital rendering with precise overlay techniques.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The automatons in Image B exhibit detailed features compatible with humanoid structure. Each hand is equipped with five defined fingers, and limbs show articulation characteristic of movable joints. The clothing snugly fits the body contours without displaying exaggerated creases or floating sections, suggesting a natural adaptation to the underlying form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass lantern encompasses the ship, bordered by distinct metal framing that emphasizes the structural borders. The transparent sides allow for visibility into the enclosed area, maintaining a sense of three-dimensional cohesion. No overlapping or broken sections infringe upon the integrity of the enclosure, providing a seamless and complete view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam cloud within Image B appears organically generated, showing smooth gradient transitions and soft edges characteristic of real vapor. These visual elements ensure the steam seems to float in a lifelike manner without any abrupt or jagged outlines. The absence of unnatural color shifts further adds to its natural depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compasses are oriented around the lantern, emphasizing nautical themes while harmonizing with the scene. Their size and placement maintain spatial coherence, without distorting the relative proportions of the ship or surrounding features. The flags also retain correct scaling and placement within the scene, supporting an undisturbed visual narrative.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gears and mechanical components on the ship in Image B are affixed with visible supports that integrate them into the ship’s structural layout. These elements follow the contours of the hull and deck as expected in cohesive mechanical construction, displaying no irregular intersections or floating parts that detract from their functional plausibility.",
