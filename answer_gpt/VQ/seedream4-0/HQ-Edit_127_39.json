    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy crown at the top appears centered on the image’s axis. The light emitted from the crown shows consistent brightness and does not exhibit any visible rendering artifacts, such as uneven lighting or pixelation, indicating solid rendering quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girders retain a structured form similar to the original, maintaining the classic geometric arrangement of the Eiffel Tower without noticeable deformation or disconnection. The detailed lattice structure closely resembles the standard orientation, reflecting a stable preservation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circuits in Image B follow the surface lines of the Eiffel Tower, appearing firmly attached and integrated with its framework. The emitted light from these circuitry harmonizes with the environment, creating a smooth transition with the surrounding illumination, indicating no floating or inconsistent light blending.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital glyphs appear embedded within the girders without altering or deforming the underlying metal structure. The integration is seamless, preserving the original integrity of the girders while adding digital elements, showing careful alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic elements in Image B exhibit translucency and a multi-layered appearance that avoids intersecting the tower’s solid structures. The rendering is smooth, with no pixelation evident, suggesting well-executed visual effects that maintain integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pixelated energy barriers encircle the base directly, aligning with the tower’s position and displaying sharp, defined edges. There is no evidence of blurring or elevation above the ground, presenting a clear and concise attachment to the base area.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital eyes in Image B are strategically positioned to complement the tower’s architecture, ensuring they don't disrupt the structural design. The emitted light produces soft shadows and subtle reflections on neighboring surfaces, integrating naturally with the existing lighting scenario.",
