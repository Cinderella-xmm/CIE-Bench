Image B depicts the baseball player's uniform in a stylized, chibi manner, which inherently involves a departure from realistic detailing. Consequently, the finer textures and details of the uniform are not preserved naturally but are adapted to the chibi aesthetic, resulting in a simplified and cartoonish representation.",

    "explanation": "Chibi style is characterized by exaggerated features, such as oversized heads and smaller bodies, which impacts the proportions and physical rationality of characters. In Image B, which showcases the player in a chibi style, the proportions are intentionally altered. The arms and legs appear short compared to the oversized head, disrupting the natural proportions seen in realistic depictions. This results in a playful yet unrealistic representation.",
