      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, motion lines are visually assessed to determine if they align smoothly with the character's jumping direction. The lines follow the character's trajectory and movement angle logically, and there are no jagged edges or irregular spacing between the lines. This implies a smooth design that visually guides a viewer's eye along the intended path of motion, enhancing the action portrayal without interruptions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The internal monologue bubble is observed near the character's head in Panel 1. It is positioned above and to the right of the head, ensuring that it remains separate from the character’s facial features and outline, allowing the text to be easily readable without interfering with the character's representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 showcases a sky that transitions from warm colors (orange tones near the horizon) to cool tones (cool blues higher up in the sky). The gradient is checked for smoothness, ensuring there are no abrupt color changes or banding that could indicate poor gradient rendering. The transition contributes to a natural dawn/dusk effect.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the parachute is examined for proportions relative to the character. It appears rounded at the top with proportional diameter, suitable for the scale of the character beneath it. Cords visibly extend from its base to the character's back, establishing a logical connection and maintaining realistic parachute depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Visual inspection of the clouds in both panels shows them as spacious, volumetric formations, resembling fluffy clouds with soft edges. They are positioned carefully to avoid intersecting or clipping into the character or mountains, preserving the integrity of the scene’s spatial arrangements and enhancing visual harmony.",
