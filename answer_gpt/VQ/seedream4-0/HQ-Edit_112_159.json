    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is perceptibly clear, with smooth edges that define the boundaries of the case. Based on visual cues, there are no areas where the glass appears to be floating or misaligned. The transparency is well-maintained, allowing for a nondistorted view of the objects within, as expected in a high-quality display case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carâ€™s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a car with a vibrant metallic red surface. Observing the car reveals smooth gradient transitions in the coloring, providing a realistic metallic finish. The detail lines along the body panels are sharply preserved, indicative of fine rendering, a standard in high-quality model displays.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The resin layers visible in Image B show a distinction in coloration, contributing to a perception of depth. Gradual transparency in these layers supports the observation of varying thickness and layered impressions, preventing the visual from appearing flat or uniformly colored.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the micro gravel texture appears to be distributed evenly across the surfaces. The variation in size and shape supports a natural feel, devoid of noticeable repetitive or artificial patterns that typically indicate poor texture quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunset sky panel in Image B transitions smoothly into the overall sky ambiance, maintaining color gradients that are consistent and harmonious. The alignment with the horizon is seamless, with no visible seams, clipping, or abrupt changes that would disrupt the visual continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates proportions reminiscent of a miniature scale. The car, road, cliffs, and the display case are in appropriate sizing relationships with one another, without any exaggerated or unrealistic sizing that would detract from the coherence expected in a detailed model display.",
