    "Question": "Q1: Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?",
    "explanation": "The added kneeling figure is drawn in a simplified form with outlines that suggest anatomically natural hand shapes. Upon inspection, the silhouette of the hand shows five fingers without any noticeable distortion or abnormal joint presentation. The positioning and structure appear consistent with common hand shapes in similar cartoon or figurative art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
    "explanation": "The leaping figure demonstrates proper extension in leg muscles, with a distinct forward motion depicted in the pose. The figure's limbs are in dynamic action reflecting the leap, positioned without breaks or unnatural angles, suggesting continuous motion. The torso aligns with the head position, supporting the leap action realistically.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
    "explanation": "The mid-air figure shows the knees tucked closely towards the chest as per the step description. The curvature visibly maintains natural anatomical alignment without undue deformation, consistent with jumping poses where knees are drawn upward firmly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "The outlines around the edited images are consistent and smoothly follow the contours of the figure. There are no ragged edges or irregularities, and the colors are contained within the delineated regions, maintaining a clean and polished look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
    "explanation": "The text captions and step numbers are placed above or beside the graphics, clearly avoiding overlap with the main character's face and limbs. This positioning ensures clarity of both instructional text and visibility of the illustration without obstruction of significant features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
    "explanation": "The simplified figures correlate well with the primary character in size and proportion relevant to their positions relative to the leap action. The kneeling and mid-air figures align with the thematic leap process, with perspective matching that of the depicted dynamics in the instructional layout, maintaining consistency throughout the steps.",
    "answer": "Yes"
