      "question": "Do the cascading arms and legs of the water elemental follow natural water flow patterns without abrupt breaks or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and legs of the water elemental are designed to resemble flowing water. Natural water flow patterns typically have smooth, continuous lines, often following the path of least resistance with gentle curves. In this case, the element's limbs appear to flow smoothly, without any sudden breaks or unnatural bending. This is consistent with natural water movement, suggesting they follow these natural patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the crystalline textures on the cliff faces varied in shape and size, and do they appear embedded within the rock rather than overlaid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cliff faces exhibit crystalline textures. For these textures to appear authentic, they should have variations in shape and size, akin to natural crystal formations. Additionally, if they seem to be a part of the cliffs, they would appear embedded within the rock, showing depth and integration rather than looking like a superficial overlay. Image B shows such variations, with crystals that appear to emerge from within the cliffs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the glowing azure pattern emit a soft, diffused light that interacts with the surrounding rock and water without harsh edges or over-bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing azure pattern on the elemental emits light. For realistic interaction with the environment, this light should be soft and diffused, creating a gentle illumination effect on nearby surfaces. This ensures there are no harsh lines or overly bright areas that disrupt the visual harmony. The image exhibits such characteristics, with the light subtly enhancing the surrounding rocks and waterfalls.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mist and leaf crown transition smoothly from the solid canopy and appear anchored to the landscape with consistent depth and motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a misty, leaf-adorned element on the figure's head. For a natural appearance, this transition should be seamless from the canopy above and integrated with the overall landscape's depth and motion. The image shows a consistent blend of these elements, making them appear part of the cohesive scene rather than detached or separate entities.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the whirlpool eyes properly sized, located in a logical position within the waterfall, and do they show realistic spiral motion and depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whirlpool eyes are a notable feature within the waterfall context. For them to maintain logical placement, they should fit proportionally with the figure's size, show realistic depth, and exhibit natural spiral motion akin to whirlpools. The image shows these eyes located within the figure in a manner that adheres to these criteria, contributing to a believable visual effect.",
