    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two towers and the central wall of the fortress proportionally reduced without distortion or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is placed inside a glass dome as a miniature model. The two towers and the central wall maintain consistent proportions that reflect the original building's structure without signs of distortion or geometry issues. This indicates that the proportion of the miniature model respects the architectural integrity of the original structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss covering the ground exhibit natural texture and color gradients, resembling real moss rather than a uniform or painted surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss in Image B displays varying shades of green and uneven surface texture, mimicking the characteristics of real moss. This suggests an attempt to produce a realistic appearance rather than a flat, uniform surface. The nuances in color and texture contribute to its lifelike appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the model knights positioned on the moss at a scale consistent with the miniature fortress, and do they rest fully on the ground without floating or intersecting with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knights in Image B are portrayed with attention to scale relative to the fortress, appearing believable as figures guarding the model structure. They are placed firmly on the mossy surface and do not exhibit signs of floating or improperly intersecting with other elements, maintaining a coherent scene within the miniature setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the faux stone pathways extend from the fortress base onto the moss with consistent texture and alignment, matching the original stonework without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone pathways in Image B visually extend from the fortress to the surrounding terrain, preserving uniform texture and alignment with no visible gaps. These elements mirror the fortress's stone details, contributing to a cohesive miniature landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass star transparent and reflective, positioned precisely at the top of the central tower's spire without overlapping or deforming the underlying structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass star appears transparent and has reflective properties, situated at the apex of the central tower's spire. It does not interfere with or distort the structure beneath it, maintaining clarity and precise placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the terrarium dome smoothly curved and transparent, enclosing the fortress without visible seams, warping, or optical distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the terrarium dome enveloping the fortress with a seamless and smooth curvature. The transparency allows clear viewing of the enclosed elements without significant warping or optical distortions, suggesting quality craftsmanship in its model representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wooden stand beneath the terrarium have visible wood grain, weathering, and design details consistent with vintage craftsmanship, and does it securely support the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden stand in Image B presents detailed wood grain and elements that signal vintage craftsmanship such as weathering effects. It appears structurally sound in its support of the glass dome, indicating careful design and construction intended to complement the overall aesthetic.",
