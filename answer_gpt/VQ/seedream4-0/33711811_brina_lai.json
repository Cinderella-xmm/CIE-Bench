    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the jagged wing structures formed from the mountain peaks have smooth transitions between rock and ice, and do they follow the natural slope and ridge lines without abrupt geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jagged peaks intended to mimic wings are analyzed. The peaks smoothly transition between rocky and icy parts, resembling natural snow caps. The peak shapes follow natural sloping and ridges, without harsh geometric breaks, consistent with how natural mountain ranges appear, suggesting they integrate organically into the photo.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale-like patterns on the lake surface uniformly spaced and reflective, with no visible repetition, pixelation, or mismatched light reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, the lake surface displays scale-like patterns that are reflective and appear uniformly spaced. There is no visible pixelation or replication that suggests an artificial texture, and the light reflections align with the surrounding environmental light, ensuring a seamless appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the peninsula resemble a continuous, tapering tail with natural curvature and surface texture, and are there no sudden breaks or unnatural bulges in its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Viewing Image B, the peninsula appears continuous and softly curved, analogous to a tail. The transition is smooth without any noticeable breaks or unusual bulges. The natural texture and shoreline flow add to its appearance of being integral to the landscape.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the house structures reshaped into a linear metallic spine that lies flat on the ground with consistent material shading and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, house structures are transformed to look like a spine, which integrates well into the landscape. This metallic spine lies flat on the ground with consistent materials and shading. There aren't any floating sections or parts that appear disconnected, presenting a cohesive look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the cloud eyes have clear, symmetrical pupil and iris structures, and are they seamlessly integrated into the existing cloud layer without visible borders or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not include cloud eyes or specific features integrated into the clouds that resemble eyes, thereby there are no pupils, irises, or other facial structures in the cloud layer of Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the grass fur consistently aligned in a single direction across the field, with natural-looking flow and no clumped or artificially drawn streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'grass fur' in Image B exhibits directionality aligning across the landscape. It features a natural flow resembling fur or grass patterns that are organically spread without clumping or signs of artificial drawing, contributing to a realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, duplicated textures, or lighting mismatches between the transformed elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, fur) and the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals no obvious seams or duplicated textures among different elements. Lighting throughout the image remains consistent without mismatches, maintaining a seamless integration even as multiple natural and fantastical elements are combined.",
