      "question": "Does the kimono feature bold, clean outlines and uniformly flat color regions without gradient blending or photographic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono displays bold, clean outlines which is typical of traditional art techniques like those used in ukiyo-e. The colors are uniformly flat, with no gradient blending present, adhering to stylized methods rather than photorealistic textures. This artistic choice creates a contrast with Image A, where the texture and gradient in the kimono are evident, giving a more realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms represented with simplified, stylized shapes and muted pink hues, avoiding photorealistic detail or irregular clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are illustrated using stylized, simplified shapes, and the hues are muted pinks typical for traditional Japanese art representations. Compared to Image A, where the blossoms have a lot of detail and irregular clumping which gives them a more realistic appearance, the stylization in Image B avoids such details and maintains a consistent, artful representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the path stones and vertical poles display textured patterns such as hatching, stippling, or woodgrain that align with traditional woodblock printing techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the path stones and poles exhibit patterns that resemble traditional printing techniques such as hatching and stippling. The texture is consistent with the aesthetic conventions of manually printed artwork like woodblock prints. This contrasts with Image A, where these structures are depicted without such artistic textures, leaning more towards realism.",

      "question": "Is the figure's body proportionate and structurally sound, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the figure in a proportionate and structurally sound manner, adhering to traditional art conventions where accurate human proportions are maintained. There are no exaggerated limbs or unnatural poses evident. Image A also maintains accurate proportions, but with a more realistic representation style compared to the stylized approach in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the distant hills depicted as simplified, layered forms with flat colors and clear outlines, consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape conventions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hills are portrayed as simplified, layered forms with flat colors and clear outlines, which aligns with conventions seen in traditional Japanese ukiyo-e art. This technique aims to create a harmonious and stylized landscape. Image A, however, uses more typical colors and textures that are indicative of realistic photographic representation rather than artistic simplification.",
