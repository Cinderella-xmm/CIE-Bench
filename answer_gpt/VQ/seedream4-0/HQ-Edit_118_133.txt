    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the teapot’s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the teapot is smooth and has a high-gloss ceramic finish with no noticeable texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from a metallic look. The smoothness and glossiness are consistent throughout the teapot's body, indicative of high-quality ceramic fabrication. This is in contrast to Image A, where the surface has intricate metallic engravings. The change from a metal texture to a ceramic one is seamless, reflecting deliberate and careful editing to preserve a unified appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the wick positioned at the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical orientation that aligns naturally with the candle design, without bending or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wick is positioned centrally and vertically emerging from the top where the lid meets the main body rather than at the former spout. There is no sign of bending or deformation, and the wick appears integrated into the candle’s design, consistent with how wicks are typically placed in such products. This suggests careful modification from Image A, where there was no wick visible, only the spout.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the handle is entirely gold in color, showing no remnants of the original wood and metal seen in Image A. The curvature remains consistent with the original handle shape, with no signs of warping or unnatural thickness changes. This suggests the handle was digitally altered to change its material appearance while maintaining its structural design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral patterns around the base of the teapot evenly spaced, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with the existing engraved motifs, without overlapping or distorting the base structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns encircle the base of the teapot evenly and match stylistically with the engraved motifs on the main body. The patterns do not overlap or distort the teapot's structure, maintaining the integrity of the overall design. This careful placement suggests an intentional design choice, seamlessly integrating with the existing aesthetic. Image A lacks these floral accents, focusing primarily on intricate metal engravings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' placed centrally on the front face of the teapot in a flowing script font that matches the luxury theme, with no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' appears centrally but is placed not on the teapot itself but likely digitally overlaid beneath on the wooden surface. It uses a flowing script font that aligns with the luxury theme of the candle design, maintaining clarity and elegance with no pixelation or clipping artifacts noted. Its separation from the teapot ensures no visual conflict with the complex patterns on the teapot's surface. Image A does not contain text, reinforcing this addition as part of the editing process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
