    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the brown leather trench coat have consistent texture and natural folds that align with human body contours, and are the brass gears and mechanical details integrated without disrupting the coat's structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brown leather trench coat is depicted with visible texture that mimics real leather, featuring seams and folds that appear consistent with the natural contours of the human body. The brass gears and mechanical details are seamlessly integrated into the design, maintaining the coat’s overall structure without appearing intrusive or artificially placed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chronometer held in the right hand proportionally sized relative to the hand, with realistic shadows and reflections, and does it maintain a natural grip without distorted fingers or misplaced joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chronometer appears proportionate in size to the hand holding it. The fingers wrap around it naturally, without any distortions or misplaced joints. Shadows and reflections on the chronometer are realistically rendered, adding to its three-dimensionality and ensuring it fits well within the hand's grip.",

      "question": "Are the goggles positioned on the tricorne hat in a way that respects the hat’s structure, with no floating parts, unnatural shadows, or clipping errors between the goggles and the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goggles are situated on the tricorne hat such that they adhere to the curvature and structure of the hat. There are no signs of floating parts, clipping errors, or shadows that appear unnatural, indicating a well-integrated design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the airships and floating cities in the background appear at appropriate distances, with consistent lighting and atmospheric perspective, and do they not overlap or obscure the subject unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airships and floating cities in the background are positioned in a manner that demonstrates depth and distance, using consistent lighting that aligns with the sunset backdrop. They do not overlap or obscure the subject unnaturally, maintaining a cohesive scene with atmospheric perspective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the leather coat, brass gears, and other materials free from unnatural repetition, blurring, or artificial edges, and do fine details such as stitching and rivets remain sharp and consistent?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures on the leather coat and brass gears are naturally detailed, without signs of repetition or blurring. Fine details like stitching and rivets are sharp and consistent, contributing to a realistic portrayal of the materials.",
