      "question": "Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the individual jigsaw pieces, they appear to be profiled with the traditional curve and notch style characteristic of jigsaw puzzles. There are no evident gaps or overlapping deformities between the pieces; instead, they align in a manner that respects the customary interlocking function of jigsaw pieces. This conclusion is drawn from visual cues of alignment and typical puzzle piece construction, combined with basic principles of jigsaw puzzle assembly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays distinct dragon patterns and a central compass. By visually assessing the image, the dragons are stained in a darker hue while the compass has a lighter stain, providing a clear contrast between the elements. The transitions between these areas appear smooth and natural, without any sudden coloration changes that would appear unnatural. This can be assessed by observing the gradual color change between elements, which aligns with how wood stain naturally behaves.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspection of Image B reveals wood grain across the dragon and compass pieces, with varied appearances that align realistically with wooden materials. Evaluating the grain patterns suggests authenticity due to their lack of repetition and apparent organic variation. This observation is shaped by understanding of wood grain diversity typically seen in natural wood products.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts puzzle pieces laid out in a scattered manner. They appear grounded upon the wooden surface, not overlapping or seeming to float, respecting gravity and spatial perspective. By observing how each piece interacts with its surrounding surface, standard placement logic grounded in physics is applied to affirm the plausibility of their arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass remains circular and features detailed engravings that are precise, such as fine lines and divisions within the compass markings. Visual inspection confirms that there is no visible distortion, maintaining structural integrity and precision expected of crafted items. This aligns with known qualities of well-made wooden and metal items, which typically uphold structural regularity and detailed craftsmanship.",
