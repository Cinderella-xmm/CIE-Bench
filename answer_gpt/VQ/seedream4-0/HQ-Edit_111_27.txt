    "Question": "Q1: Does the geisha's face retain anatomical accuracy with natural proportions and smooth contours despite the stained glass transformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stained glass effect should be analyzed by considering how stained glass art typically interprets anatomical features. Stained glass usually simplifies and stylizes forms while preserving a certain level of anatomical accuracy. In this case, the face in Image B is rendered with smooth contours and proportions that suggest the artist attempted to maintain anatomical accuracy transformed through the stained glass medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the patterns on the kimono composed of distinct, sharp segments resembling leaded glass, with no blurred edges or unnatural blending between colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono displays patterns that are sharply defined akin to leaded glass, characteristic of stained glass artwork. Each segment retains a distinct separation with proper outlining typical of stained glass works, displaying no blurring or blending that would detract from the stained glass style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the cherry blossoms exhibit uniform glass-like textures with clear outlines and internal color gradations typical of stained glass, without appearing mushy or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in Image B are rendered with clear outlines, with each petal having distinct sections of color similar to stained glass pieces. The transitions between colors show gradation, common in stained glass, lending them a glass-like appearance without any mushiness or pixelation, maintaining the integrity of stained glass texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the peacock fan have a logical number of feather segments arranged symmetrically around a central spine, with no overlapping or misaligned parts?",
    "explanation": "The peacock fan in Image B should be analyzed for symmetry and logical arrangement. In Image B, the fan is depicted with stylized feather segments that are evenly spaced and arranged surgically around a central point. The symmetry and proper alignment suggest a thoughtful transformation into a stained glass style without overlapping or misaligned parts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the background lines smoothly curved and interconnected without abrupt breaks, gaps, or inconsistent thicknesses that suggest rendering artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background lines are consistent with the style of stained glass, showing smooth curves and interconnections without any abrupt breaks or gaps. The thickness of the lines remains consistent, indicating a careful design choice that avoids artifacts commonly found in less polished renderings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q6: Does the hand holding the fan display five clearly defined fingers with proper ergonomics and no extra digits or fused joints?",
    "explanation": "The hand in Image B, despite the stained glass aesthetic, exhibits five distinct and properly proportioned fingers. Each finger appears ergonomically positioned to hold the fan, with no visual anomalies such as extra digits or fused joints, preserving anatomical correctness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
