      "question": "Does the character's face retain its natural proportions and features without any visible distortion or unnatural textures after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is rendered in a stylized 3D cartoon form, which often simplifies or exaggerates features to fit a cute or appealing aesthetic, especially common in chibi or animated designs. These designs purposefully alter natural proportions to align with a certain style, and this is not considered a distortion or unnatural texture in the context of such a design style. This indicates that in the given stylistic framework, the face retains coherence and does not show unintended distortion.",

      "question": "Is the character's purple hair depicted with smooth, consistent shading and texture that matches the 3D cartoon style without any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hair has a vibrant purple hue and appears to be shaded smoothly, with gradient transitions that are common in 3D rendering styles. There are no visible artifacts like harsh lines or distracting deviations from the intended design, suggesting that the hair adheres well to the 3D cartoon aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the character's black outfit maintain its structural integrity and material appearance, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or loss of fine details in the 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character dressed in a black outfit that appears structurally sound and consistent with a 3D cartoon render. The contours and edges are well-defined, with the simplicity fitting the animated style, showing no signs of broken geometric shapes or significant loss of detail. This indicates the integrity is retained in the transition to 3D art.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the programmer-related tools or icons, such as code fragments or keyboards, integrated into the artwork in a way that complements the character and background without introducing any visual inconsistencies or unnatural placements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, various programmer-related elements, like code snippets and a keyboard, are incorporated into the scene. These elements blend naturally with the character, harmonizing with the background's tech-themed design. The floating code snippets and related icons do not disrupt the scene’s coherence, suggesting a well-thought integration that complements the overall aesthetic theme.",

      "question": "Do the title banner and nameplate feature crisp, polished borders that match the purple and black color scheme, contributing to the visual coherence of the character card without any distracting or inconsistent elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner and nameplate in Image B are finished with clear, sharp borders that align with the purple and black color palette of the character card. This consistency aids in the overall coherence of the image, ensuring that these elements do not become visually jarring or inconsistent with the character card’s theme. The polished look enhances the professionalism and thematic consistency, suggesting attention to detail in their design.",
