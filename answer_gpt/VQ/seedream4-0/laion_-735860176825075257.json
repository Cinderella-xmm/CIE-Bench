      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design style mimics a paper-cut art, which is characterized by sharp, clearly defined lines and angles typical of such artwork. The rooflines, gables, and timber framing in this artistic rendition of a building show well-defined, angular edges consistent with this paper-cut style, with no indications of rounding or blurring. This aligns with the paper-cut approach, where precision and sharpness in design are emphasized.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges appear uniformly applied with consistent reflectivity and no pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold foil accents in Image B are integral to the paper-cut style, adding elegance and depicting luxury. In this image, the gold details on the window frames and flower boxes appear to maintain a consistent finish, with uniform reflectivity, which is a common characteristic of foil in art. There are no visible signs of pixelation or smudging, which would disrupt the foil's sleek and polished appearance.",

      "question": "Is the crimson color of the entrance awning evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting direction, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an entrance awning rendered in a paper-cut style with a bold crimson hue. The color distribution appears even, fitting the style's need for uniform blocks of color. There are no abrupt shifts or shadows inconsistent with the lighting direction, which would be out of place in a paper-cut artwork where colors are generally evenly applied.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric arch borders cleanly aligned with the edges of the image and do they not overlap or distort any part of the building's structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric arch borders are elements characteristic of the paper-cut style, providing a frame that complements the building's structure. These borders are precisely aligned with the edges of the image, serving to enclose rather than distort the architectural features. The consistent alignment without overlap suggests careful design typical of quality paper-cut art.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edge of the image appear clean and continuous without visible clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that suggest improper trimming or rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clear and continuous edge throughout, maintaining the integrity of the paper-cut design. There are no visible issues such as clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that would detract from the overall presentation and suggest technical errors. The clean edges reflect the attention to detail in crafting a coherent and polished image.",
