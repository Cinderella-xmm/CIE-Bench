      "question": "Does the crystal cloche have smooth, continuous curvature with natural light refraction and no visible seams or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a crystal cloche covering the birdhouse. The cloche appears smoothly curved, with consistent and natural light refraction visible across its surface. The light reflects off the glass without showing any seams or jagged edges, indicating that the curvature is continuous. This conclusion is drawn by observing the play of light and reflections on the glass, an understanding based on the properties of glass and high-quality craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Are the sapphire-colored shingles uniformly textured and do the gold details follow the roofâ€™s architectural contours without appearing artificially painted or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sapphire-colored shingles have a consistent texture, maintaining a uniform appearance across the roof. The gold details are intricate and follow the architectural contours of the roof seamlessly, suggesting they are part of the structure rather than painted or detached elements. The observation is made by evaluating the alignment and integration of the gold details with the overall design of the roof.",

      "question": "Do the flower beds at the entrance have natural plant textures, correct scale relative to the birdhouse, and sit flush with the ground surface without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flower beds in Image B exhibit natural plant textures, with each plant appearing distinct and realistic. The scale of the flowers is consistent and proportional relative to the birdhouse, which suggests close attention to detail. The plants are positioned flush with the ground, integrated smoothly without floating above or clipping through surfaces. This is discerned through a close examination of their alignment with the entrance and ground around them.",

      "question": "Are the woodland creatures visible only through the window openings, positioned behind glass, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woodland creatures are not visible through window openings nor positioned behind glass. They are positioned outside, on the grassy mound, with no subtle shadows indicating their interaction with the ambient light through window glass. This discrepancy is observed by examining their location relative to windows and analyzing how light interacts with their surfaces directly.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the grassy mound have natural undulations, consistent grass coverage, and a seamless transition to the birdhouse base without gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy mound in Image B demonstrates natural undulations, portraying a realistic landscape. The grass coverage is consistent, and the transition to the birdhouse base is seamless with no visible gaps or floating sections. This conclusion is reached by observing the continuity of the ground level and the juvenile landscaping surrounding the base of the birdhouse.",

      "question": "Do all added elements (cloche, flowers, creatures, mound) respond to light consistently with the same direction and intensity as the original birdhouse and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added elements such as the cloche, flowers, creatures, and mound respond to light in a manner consistent with the original birdhouse and background. The shadows and highlights align with the rest of the scene, reflecting the same direction and intensity of light. This analysis is based on the observation of how all elements exhibit similar lighting conditions congruent with the scene's ambient light characteristics.",
