    "Question": "Q2: Is the teacup held by the capybara’s front paws at a natural angle and scale, with no deformation or floating appearance?",
    "explanation": "In the image, the capybara is holding a teacup in front of its body. The teacup seems to be scaled appropriately relative to the capybara's paws, and it does not appear to be floating unnaturally or exhibiting distortion.

    "Question": "Q3: Does the suit worn by the capybara exhibit consistent fabric texture, natural draping, and appropriate seam lines that follow the animal’s body contours?",
    "explanation": "The capybara in Image B is donned in a suit which visually appears well-tailored to its body. The fabric texture is consistent throughout the suit, with no jarring changes or unrealistic patches. The natural draping follows the body contours of a standing capybara, and seam lines are meticulously placed, further enforcing the fit and formal appearance of the attire. This indicates a high attention to detail in the design process.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the monocle positioned properly over the capybara’s eye without overlapping fur unnaturally or showing rendering artifacts like ghosting or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The monocle in Image B is placed over one eye of the capybara, typical of a period piece look. Upon close inspection, the monocle aligns well with the eye, and it does not interfere with the surrounding fur in an unnatural way. There are no obvious rendering artifacts such as ghosting or misalignment, suggesting a seamless integration of the monocle into the overall character design.",

The lighting of the scene is consistent with sunset or sunrise, as shown by the warm tones and shadows. The architectural elements appear proportionally accurate and are rendered in a spatially coherent manner in relation to the foreground elements, aligning well with the scene's established time of day.",
