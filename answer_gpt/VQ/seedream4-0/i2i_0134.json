      "question": "Does the broccoli appear structurally consistent and credible as a small real tree without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is edited to resemble a small tree. By closely examining the texture and structure, it resembles a realistic miniature tree with natural-looking stalks that resemble trunks and florets that mimic foliage. The broccoli's texture does not appear unnatural or inconsistent with that of real foliage, thereby making it seem credible as a small tree. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural textures that disrupt this illusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the newly added forest floor support the broccoli as a small real tree in a way that appears physically logical and does not introduce distortions such as broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the forest floor is crafted with details such as soil and roots, which physically support the broccoli structure as it might support any small tree. The floor is consistent in texture and structure, with no distortions or broken shapes suggesting anything illogical or digitally manipulated beyond the intended appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the broccoli consistent with sunlight filtering through a forest canopy, without creating unnatural lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B suggests sunlight filtering through the trees, creating natural shadows and highlights on the broccoli. The light appropriately casts spots and shades on the broccoli, consistent with the ambient light expected in a forest setting. Unnatural effects such as overly sharp shadows or glaring highlights are absent, maintaining the scene's realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the broccoli detailed enough to resemble a small tree trunk, avoiding unnatural smoothing or graininess?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the broccoli in Image B is detailed such that the stalk resembles a small tree trunk with rough, realistic texture. The florets are not unnaturally smooth, and there is no excessive graininess, preserving the broccoli's natural appearance while resembling miniature tree foliage.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition harmonious, with the forest floor and background convincingly integrating with the broccoli as a tree, without any visual contradictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is designed to integrate the broccoli seamlessly into the forest setting. The surroundings such as the trees, the forest floor, and the lighting harmonize with the broccoli depicted as a small tree. This integration avoids visual contradictions such as mismatched scales or lighting disparities, thereby maintaining a consistent and believable scene.",
