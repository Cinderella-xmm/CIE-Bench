    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie characters have cartoon faces with eyes and mouths that are smoothly integrated into the curvature of the cookie surface. They appear naturally positioned with respect to the circular form, without any distortions or elements that seem unattached or floating. Given the perspective and stylistic representation, this is consistent and logical for a cartoon character design, making the features appear coherent with the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cookie surface of the whoopie pie characters retains some semblance of texture, represented with a cartoon-like simplification but still showing cracks that mimic those found naturally in baked goods. These features give a sense of realism even in a stylized depiction. This preservation of texture is consistent with the underlying characteristic of a baked cookie.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the whoopie pie characters are small and simple, consistent with the principles of cartoon design where exaggerated or simplified features are typical. These limbs are logically connected at their expected points, like the sides of the whoopie pie, and proportionally modest compared to the body to maintain visual harmony, avoiding any perception of detachment or misalignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leading whoopie pie character holds a spatula that, while larger relative to typical spatulas, fits the exaggerated style common in cartoons. It is gripped by the limb in a manner that suggests motion, consistent with a typical depiction of an adventurous character in animation. This reflects a natural and dynamic interaction within the stylized world of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters visibly sit on the plate with their lower halves properly positioned under the edge, showing a typical scene of animated characters perched or resting on their surface. This placement avoids any form of floating or unnatural transition, providing continuity and stability to the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the text bubble containing “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” placed adjacent to the speaking character without overlapping critical features like eyes or limbs, and is the handwritten font clear and unblurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubble is positioned near the character emitting the dialogue, maintaining clear visibility and avoiding overlap with essential features like eyes or limbs. The handwritten font within is legible, providing clear comprehension without blurring, ensuring that the speech representation is efficient and non-intrusive.",
