    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the snow globe appears to have a smooth and continuous edge. The surface of the glass is pristine without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation. This observation is based solely on the visual cues of the globe's boundaries and the clarity of its surface, which should mimic a real glass globe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in the edited image show that the snow globe's surface exhibits highlights and bending patterns typical of clear glass. The image captures how the light interacts with the convex surface, creating a subtle distortion of the background and reflections, which is characteristic of clear glass materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures inside the snow globe are depicted with complete limbs that are proportionately scaled to the figures' bodies. There are no clear indications of any extra fingers or missing arms. The postures of these figures appear normal and consistent with miniature representations of people walking along the Wall.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the snow globe, the depiction of autumn-colored leaves and green vegetation appears seamless. The transition between the colors is smooth, and there are no abrupt changes or blocky textures visible. This suggests that the autumn colors are integrated thoughtfully into the scene to maintain a natural and cohesive look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow particles inside the globe are depicted in a dynamic, swirling pattern without completely obscuring the Great Wall or the figures. This allows the interior scene to be visible despite the presence of the snow, reminiscent of how snow behaves in a traditional snow globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic birds inside the snow globe are detailed enough to be recognized as flying objects. They have defined wings and body shapes and are positioned above the wall's surface. This setup suggests they are portrayed to appear airborne and do not touch any surfaces inside the globe.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in the edited image is dark with a discernible wood grain texture, adding realism. It appears stable, holding the snow globe without tilt or support issues. The engraved text on the base is clear and legible, indicating attention to detail in the design of the decorative base.",
