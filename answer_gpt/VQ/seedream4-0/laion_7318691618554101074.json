      "question": "Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wands appear to have smooth surfaces with consistent refraction properties due to their clear, prism-like structure. The shapes are symmetrical and lack any visible digital artifacts or irregularities, indicating a high-quality rendering in terms of 3D representation and lighting. Observing their texture and shape, it seems that they have been crafted with attention to maintain a seamless visual appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the etched floral patterns are clearly visible and appear to be evenly distributed around the vase. There are no visible interruptions in the pattern, and they smoothly integrate into the vase's surface. The shading is consistent, reflecting a precise and deliberate etching that is typical for high-quality crystal works. The continuity and integration suggest careful craftsmanship in its design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carved crystal ribbon around the vase exhibits a complete form, with floral motifs that are clearly intact and free from breaks. The high level of detail and the absence of any overlaps or flattened areas suggest that the 3D rendering has preserved the integrity of the design without any errors typically associated with conversion issues. This implies an accurate and high-quality depiction of the crystal's 3D structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection of the crystal vase on the mirrored surface appears to be clear and symmetrical. The lighting is consistent across the vase and its reflection, indicating a well-executed representation of reflections, which suggests that the light source and viewing angle have been accounted for to produce an accurate depiction. The details and lack of distortion in the reflection demonstrate high attention to rendering quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pearls inside the crystal vase appear to be uniformly sized and spaced, maintaining their spherical shapes without visible warping or distortion. The clarity of each pearl and their consistent arrangement suggest that there are no rendering errors or compression artifacts that would typically cause blurring. The consistent appearance of the pearls implies a well-maintained visual quality, likely aided by precise rendering techniques.",
