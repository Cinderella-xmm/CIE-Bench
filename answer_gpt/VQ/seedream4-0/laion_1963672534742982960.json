        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style warrior in Image B features long hair that is scaled appropriately for the chibi form, maintaining the flow of the hair without unnatural deformation.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
