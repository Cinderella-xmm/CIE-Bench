      "question": "Does the chibi-style illustration of the dog retain its distinct characteristics without unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is illustrated in a chibi style that emphasizes simplicity and cuteness. It maintains distinct characteristics, such as its sleeping posture and general body shape, without introducing unnatural textures or losing important details that would detract from the chibi aesthetic. This style deliberately omits fine details to capture essence rather than realism, adhering to the conventions of chibi art.",

      "question": "Does the bold white outline around the illustration enhance visual clarity without disrupting structural coherence or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold white outline in Image B serves to delineate the sticker's edge and accentuate its visual separation from the background, enhancing clarity. The outline is consistent and complements the overall design without introducing artifacts or disrupting the structural coherence of the illustration. It maintains its role as a purely stylistic element that aids in defining the sticker without interfering with the depicted objects.",

      "question": "Do the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain structural consistency and visual credibility in their minimalist flat design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag are illustrated using a minimalist design style that simplifies their features to basic geometric and recognizable forms. Each object retains structural proportions that make them easily identifiable, ensuring visual credibility. This approach aligns with the principles of flat design where objects are simplified for clarity and emphasis on form, without compromising their recognizability.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the extension of the dog and bench slightly beyond the circular frame preserve natural appearance and avoid distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and bench slightly extend beyond the circular frame, which is a common stylistic choice in sticker design to convey relaxed boundaries and enhance visual engagement. This extension is done intentionally and avoids any distortion, maintaining the natural appearance integral to the chibi style and ensuring that the overall structure remains coherent.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transparent background maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent background serves to focus attention on the sticker elements themselves by removing unnecessary visual noise. It is a typical feature that allows for flexible placement on various surfaces without altering the sticker's inherent look and feel. This transparency maintains the stickerâ€™s natural appearance in its intended form, which aligns with typical sticker design practices.",
