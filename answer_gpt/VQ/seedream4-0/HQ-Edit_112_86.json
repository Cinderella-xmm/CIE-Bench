    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's main body is transparently made of glass. This can be deducted from its reflective qualities and visibility of light refractions, both typical characteristics of glass structures, and no evidence of opaque or metallic residue is visible.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, by examining the floral patterns visible on the glass surface, they appear evenly frosted without any distortions or variations in opacity, consistent with meticulous crafting techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the handle and spout having an amber tint. The coloring is evenly distributed with sharp boundaries, demonstrating quality craftsmanship without any adverse visual effects like color fringing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the object’s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection under the teapot in Image B appears symmetrical and sharp. Its alignment under the base is precise, mirroring the teapot accurately with observable transparency effects typical of reflective surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing Image A and B, proportions of the components in Image B are consistent with Image A. There is no indication of any distortions, aptly preserving the original structure’s balance and alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
