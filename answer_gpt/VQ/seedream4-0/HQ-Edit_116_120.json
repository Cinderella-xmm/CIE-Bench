    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spherical glass dome in Image B appears to be transparent and smooth. The refraction and reflection of light occur correctly, as there is no visible warping or distortion of the sandcastle inside. This indicates that the dome is well-constructed with proper material properties, contributing to an unobstructed view of the sandcastle.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mahogany base in Image B shows a convincing wood texture with detailed grain patterns. It has a consistent thickness and geometric structure, providing proper support for the dome and sandcastle without presenting distortion or imbalance. The scale appears appropriate, ensuring aesthetic harmony.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grains in Image B are distributed in a manner that mimics sand, with a subtle glittering effect. They do not cover or obscure any details of the sandcastle's architecture, allowing features like stairs and towers to be well-defined and clear.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seashells are clearly defined and appropriately scaled in relation to the sandcastle. They lack pixelation and edge artifacts, suggesting high-quality rendering that maintains their natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plaque in Image B is inscribed with 'Empire of the Shores' in a manner that is clear and readable. It is securely attached to the base, with a consistent matte pearl surface that avoids any glare or mismatched texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandcastle and surrounding shells in Image B possess a consistent matte pearl finish. There are no sections exhibiting excessive shine or reflection, maintaining a cohesive and visually appealing surface texture.",
