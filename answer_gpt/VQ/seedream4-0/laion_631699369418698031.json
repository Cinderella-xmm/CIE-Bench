      "question": "Is the cylindrical glass dome fully enclosing the totem pole without visible clipping, jagged edges, or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cylindrical glass dome visually appears to be a seamless enclosure surrounding the totem pole. It maintains a smooth outline and consistent transparency, typical of well-crafted glass objects, which indicates there are no visible clipping or odd edges. This observation aligns with world knowledge of glass enclosures used to exhibit artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the ferns and moss at the base of the totem grounded and proportionally sized, with no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents ferns and moss as grounded decorations at the base of the totem. They align properly with the totem's base, showing realistic weight and positioning without appearing to float or be misaligned. This is consistent with knowledge of how natural elements should be displayed within such an exhibition setting.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly perched on the top of the totem with correct scale, natural wing shape, and no deformation of the totem’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is situated on the totem, maintaining a realistic scale relative to the carved object. Its wings are shaped naturally, and there is no indication of structural distortion of the totem as a result of placing this element. The butterfly's appearance is harmonious with the customary size observed in such displays.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates ferns, moss, and a butterfly integrated with color tones that match the surrounding wood of the totem. The colors align naturally with typical woodland scenery, avoiding any apparent color mismatches or shifts that would be unrealistic. This design is consistent with knowledge of natural ecosystems.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves the carved facial details and wood grain of the totem, keeping them visible and without any distortion post-editing. This indicates a careful editing process that respects the integrity of the carved designs, consistent with what is expected in maintaining the artifact’s authenticity.",
