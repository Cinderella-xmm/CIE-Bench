      "question": "Does the entire cathedral structure appear uniformly rendered in warm stained wood with consistent grain patterns and realistic wood textures across all surfaces, including spires, arches, and tracery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals the cathedral model is indeed crafted to appear as if made entirely of wood. The grain patterns and textures are consistently depicted across the entirety of the model, including complex areas like the spires and arches, giving a cohesive wooden appearance. This is achieved through the use of consistent color and texture, suggesting meticulous attention to detail in the rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the edges of the shadow box clearly defined, structurally coherent, and proportionally sized relative to the cathedral model, with no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a shadow box housing the cathedral model. The edges are well-defined, the structure appears coherent, and it is proportionally sized relative to the cathedral. There are no apparent gaps, misalignments, or floating components, which underscores the precision in the construction and presentation of the model within the box.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiny pews and chandeliers positioned correctly within the interior of the cathedral model, maintaining proper scale and alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults, and do they cast consistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the tiny pews and chandeliers are visibly positioned in a manner that aligns well with the cathedral's architectural features, such as columns and arches. The scale is appropriately maintained, enhancing realism. However, no distinct shadows cast by these elements can be discerned, which might impact the depth perception slightly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the clock mechanism located at the back of the model, featuring visible gears and a moving path for small figures, with no distorted shapes, inconsistent materials, or implausible motion trajectories?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock mechanism observed in Image B, including visible gears, appears consistent in terms of material form and design. The presence of a moving path for small figures is noted, and the structures do not show distorted shapes. The arrangement suggests a logical motion trajectory, enhancing plausibility within the mechanical setup.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the intricate gothic carvings, including the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements, retain sharp detail and accurate geometry in the miniature model without visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the gothic carvings in remarkable detail. The rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements are rendered sharply with accurate geometry, devoid of blurring or pixelation. This meticulous detailing underscores the precision in miniature craftsmanship, preserving the architectural integrity of the gothic motifs.",
