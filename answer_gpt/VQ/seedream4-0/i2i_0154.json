      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or breaks in the car's bodywork where the different views meet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the car is shown from different perspectives: side views and a top view. The transition between these views should maintain the integrity of the car's bodywork without any visual breaks or artifacts. By examining the outlines and connection points between different views, there don't appear to be any interruptions or breaks, indicating a seamless connection between the car's sections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all views of the car maintain consistent material properties and lighting, avoiding unnatural differences?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image should show consistent visual properties across all depicted views of the car. This includes the reflections, shadows, and overall finish of the car's paint and materials. Analyzing the reflections on the car's surface and the way light interacts with it in all views, they are consistent, matching the expected behavior of a glossy black surface under uniform lighting. There are no abrupt or unnatural differences in the way the material appears.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car's geometry appear proportionally correct and undistorted across all views, particularly in the wheels and body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For the edited image, the various views of the car should reflect accurate geometric proportions to avoid distortion. The wheels, which are often vulnerable to distortion in side and top views, should retain their circular shape, and the body panels should remain aligned and proportionate. Upon examining these elements, the car's features, such as the wheels and body lines, are consistent and well-proportioned across the views, with no signs of distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In the top view, are the car's roofline and window outlines clear and detailed, without any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top view of the car should display the roofline and window outlines clearly, with attention to detail. The ability to distinguish these elements without blurriness or ambiguity is important. Upon reviewing the top view, the roofline appears precise, and the window outlines are well-defined, maintaining fine detail and clarity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the newly added views of the car integrate seamlessly with the background, without introducing any disruptive discontinuities or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the integration of the car with the background should appear natural, where the car does not seem floating or poorly placed on the white background. The background here is plain white, which simplifies the task of seamless integration. The views of the car appear well-aligned and naturally placed on the background, with no visible discontinuities or inconsistencies between the car and its surroundings.",
