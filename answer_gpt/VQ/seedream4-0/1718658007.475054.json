      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied to the octopus uniformly distributed without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus has a smooth gradient of pastel colors applied to its body and tentacles. The colors transition evenly without any sudden shifts or pixelated edges, contributing to a polished and fluid appearance. This uniform distribution is typical for high-quality digital illustrations, where the colors blend seamlessly to create a visually pleasing effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the brush outlines around the octopus follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles without overlapping or breaking at joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the octopus with carefully crafted brush outlines that smoothly follow the contours of its body and tentacles. The lines enhance the natural curves, ensuring that no outlines overlap incorrectly or break at any of the joints. This precision implies careful attention to detail, which is crucial in maintaining the integrity of a cartoon-style illustration.",

      "question": "Are the waves near the shore smooth and consistent in shape, showing natural foam patterns without jagged or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves near the shore are depicted with smooth and flowing shapes that capture the essence of water movement. The foam patterns in the waves are naturally shaped, without displaying any jagged or broken textures, giving the image a harmonious and dynamic look. This is typical of a well-designed graphic that aims to depict a tranquil ocean scene.",

      "question": "Is the text positioned above the horizon line without intersecting clouds or causing visible distortion in the background sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is carefully positioned above the horizon line, ensuring it does not intersect with the clouds or cause any distortion in the background sky. The placement allows the text to be clearly readable while maintaining the integrity of the scene behind it. This is important in maintaining both aesthetic appeal and legibility.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain align with the direction of the sunset light source and maintain depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the octopus and the surrounding terrain align coherently with the direction of the light source, presumably from the setting sun. The depth perception is maintained through the appropriate length and orientation of the shadows, which enhance the 3D effect and realism of the illustrated scene, adding to the overall atmospheric coherence.",
