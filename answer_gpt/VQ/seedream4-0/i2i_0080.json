      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the dog's fur consistent and natural across both the left side and back views in the combined image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur texture appears smooth and consistent in both the left side and back views. The fur is depicted with uniform shading and highlights typical of cartoon illustrations. There is no visible disruption or unevenness in the fur texture across these views. Using common sense about cartoon art styles, this consistency is expected and achieved in the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is shown lying comfortably on the bed in both the left side and back views. The positioning seems plausible with the paws resting naturally, and the body aligns with the dimensions of the bed.
