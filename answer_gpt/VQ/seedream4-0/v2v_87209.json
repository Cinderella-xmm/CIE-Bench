      "question": "Do the sinuous lines and botanical motifs on the owls appear smooth and integrated without any broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sinuous lines and botanical motifs follow an Art Nouveau style, characterized by flowing, intricate patterns that generally lack sharp edges or geometric interruptions. The curves and swirls are consistent with this design language, and visually, they appear smooth and integrated. Art Nouveau commonly features harmonious natural forms, and the motifs on the owls adhere to this aesthetic by lacking broken shapes which would otherwise disrupt the flow of design.",

      "question": "Is the 'Owlegories' typography in whiplash script legible and harmoniously integrated into the design without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Owlegories' typography is presented in an elegant and whimsical script that fits well with the Art Nouveau theme, known for its organic and decorative style. The text is legible with good contrast against the background, and the artistic curves of the script blend with the surrounding design, ensuring that the typography complements rather than conflicts with the visual elements.",

      "question": "Does the background with organic, curvilinear patterns complement the main elements without causing any visual clutter or unnatural disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features organic, curvilinear patterns typical of the Art Nouveau style. These patterns, with their sinuous lines and botanical themes, are designed to naturally flow and create harmony with the main elements (e.g., the owls on the cover). The integration is such that it enriches the visual experience without overwhelming the focal points, avoiding visual clutter or unnatural disruptions.",

      "question": "Is the 'SHOP NOW' button clearly visible yet delicately integrated into the Art Nouveau design without appearing jarring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the 'SHOP NOW' button is visible, it appears more subdued than in Image A. In the intricate Art Nouveau setting, it has been delicately placed within the design, maintaining the overall aesthetic without overly standing out or appearing out of place. The integration respects the delicate and ornate nature of the Art Nouveau style and doesn't visually disrupt the main elements.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the DVD case and CD consistent and visually credible within the new Art Nouveau style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the DVD case and CD are consistent with expected dimensions for these items, and they are credibly adapted into the Art Nouveau style. The style embellishments do not alter the functional recognizability of the DVD case or CD but instead convey an artistic flair that aligns with the intricate design elements typical of Art Nouveau. This integration ensures the items remain both functional and stylistically coherent.",
