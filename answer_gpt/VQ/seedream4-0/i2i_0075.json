      "question": "Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted with a cartoon-like style, where the fur is illustrated with smooth color regions and defined outlines typical of drawings. This consistent styling makes the fur on both the side and the front of the cat appear uniform and coherent without noticeable discrepancies typical of real-life textures. The artistic choice naturally omits intricate fur details, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies. Thus, the front and side views share a consistent texture without evident issues in this cartoon rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stylized depiction of a cat, presented in both front and side views. In the drawing, proportions are carefully maintained to ensure both perspectives align well, with similarly sized features like the body, head, legs, and tail appearing proportionate. The artistic rendering ensures a proportionally correct alignment, reflecting how illustrators often strive to maintain consistency across multiple perspectives in character design, thereby avoiding noticeable distortion or overlap artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the cat's eyes and ears are stylized with prominent, clean outlines and minimal detail, typical of cartoon drawings. The shapes are simplified, but they maintain a recognizable and defined form consistent with how cat features are often depicted in illustrations. Artistic style typically prioritizes clarity over detailed realism, ensuring there are no artifacts or blurring, as such elements are meticulously drawn to maintain aesthetic cohesiveness within the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image illustrates two views of the cat side by side, but they are separated by a visual boundary that distinctively splits the two perspectives. Within each view, lines and shapes are purposefully designed without awkward intersections or misalignment, rendering each view self-contained and unified in the cartoon style. With the artistic convention, transitions are distinct yet visually logical, sidestepping broken shapes or awkward intersections at the meeting point between the two views.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The combined perspectives in Image B, although presented separately, do not overlap or contort the cat's posture in unnatural ways. Each view creatively adheres to the typical sitting position of cats, with limbs and body parts aligned visually to depict plausible postures. The artistic style manages to maintain correct anatomical proportions in both views, implying careful attention in preserving logical posture and avoiding unnatural bending or stretchings.",
