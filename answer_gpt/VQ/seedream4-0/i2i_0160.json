    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements (birds and branch) and the new background (starry night sky and moon) appear seamless without any unnatural artifacts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds and the branch maintain their original positions and features. The transition to the new starry night sky background is smooth, with no obvious visual artifacts or breaks indicating manipulation around the edges of these elements. This signifies a well-executed edit where the elements blend seamlessly without visible disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and lighting of the starry night sky consistent with the rest of the image, and do they not introduce any unnatural artifacts or conflicting light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the night sky is depicted with a deep blue palette typical of night scenes, speckled with stars. The birds and foliage are illuminated in a way that suggests moonlight rather than the golden sunlight present in Image A. This consistent lighting across elements helps avoid unnatural shadows or conflicting light sources, preserving a harmonious composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the placement and appearance of the new moon natural within the context of the night sky, and does it not appear out of place or overly bright compared to the stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon in Image B is integrated into the night sky, positioned off-center, which is common in nature. Its brightness and size are proportionate to the stars, preventing it from dominating the scene or appearing artificially placed. The moonlight's subtle reflection on the birds and foliage supports a natural context.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the birds retain their detailed features, texture, and proportions after the background change, showing no signs of distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds' detailed features, such as their feathers and body proportions, remain intact and unaffected by the background change. The texture and intricate details of the birds are as clear and defined as they are in the original image, indicating no distortion or information loss from the edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tree branch and leaves appear naturally lit and integrate seamlessly with the starry night sky, without any obvious inconsistencies in shadowing or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branch and leaves are depicted with subtle lighting that mimics moonlight, aligning with the night setting introduced by the starry sky. The transition between these foreground elements and the background is smooth, with consistent shadows and lighting enhancing the natural integration.",
