      "question": "Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D character's face is intentionally designed to follow a chibi style, which inherently simplifies facial details and alters proportions for stylistic effect. This style naturally involves a larger head and simplified facial features, which do not aim to retain realistic facial details and instead prioritize a cute aesthetic. Since the artwork's intent aligns with the chibi style rather than realistic facial rendering, the character does not exhibit unnatural distortions or artifacts within this context.",

      "question": "Are the chibi-like long-legged proportions of the 3D character visually plausible and structurally coherent, avoiding unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a 3D character designed in a stylized chibi form, characterized by extended limbs relative to the torso. The character maintains coherence in its proportions that align with typical chibi styling and ensures that limbs appear structurally coherent without unnatural distortions given the artistic freedom allowed by such stylization.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the outfit and accessories of the 3D character incorporate the green and burnt orange hues naturally, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D character in Image B features a color palette prominently including green and burnt orange, similar to the items presented in the adjacent fashion examples. The hues are well-integrated into the character's clothing and accessories, maintaining a uniform and intentional aesthetic without displaying unnatural textures or losing detail, consistent with typical 3D rendering practices.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is accessorized with glasses, a clipboard, and footwear, all of which are harmonious in their presentation. They follow the character's overall color scheme and design style, contributing to the character's realistic and fashionable depiction. These elements are naturally incorporated without standing out incongruently from the rest of the design, thus maintaining authenticity.",

      "question": "Does the solid background color complement and highlight the 3D character's overall color scheme without introducing any distracting artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid color that matches the 3D character's color scheme, reinforcing the cohesiveness of the overall design. The simplicity of the background serves to highlight the character without adding distractions or artifacts, thereby providing a clean visual context.",
