    "Question": "Q1: Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?",
    "explanation": "The spectacles in Image B are placed over the bear standing in a classroom setting. The spectacles should naturally fit over the bear’s eyes without adjusting the fur in an unrealistic manner or introducing reflections that appear artificial. From the analysis of Image B, there are no visible deformations or unnatural reflections indicating the spectacles are well-integrated with the bear's image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is given a distinguished beard, which suggests maturity. The facial expression appears to blend with these features without noticeable distortion to the geometry of the nose, mouth, or jawline.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
    "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B is positioned near the bear’s mouth, indicating dialogue. It is meant to appear naturally connected with a clear directional tail. There are no visible occlusions or distortions affecting the bear’s fur around where the speech bubble is anchored.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
    "explanation": "The transformation chart is not directly inside the bear's mouth, but depicted in a side panel of the image, showing a salmon's life stages underwater. Thus, there is no interaction directly with the bear's mouth.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation chart visually appears on the right panel immersing within the water, indicating a proper alignment. However, there is an absence of visible shadows or depth cues directly cast onto the water from the labels, which may not fully match a natural immersive appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
    "explanation": "The fact box in the right panel of Image B is placed within an open area of the water section without obstructing significant elements like the tree line or the water. The placement is strategic to avoid covering critical scene elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The text in both the speech bubble and the fact box in Image B appears smooth and legible, with no visible pixelation or aliasing artifacts affecting readability or aesthetic coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
    "explanation": "The blue hues in the transformation chart in Image B and the forest background do complement each other, maintaining a consistent color scheme with no drastic shifts when compared visually and thematically to the natural palette of an outdoor forest scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q9: Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite overlays, the bear’s fur strands remain defined and water details retain their clarity and movement, indicating these elements are preserved and not obscured by the added graphical components.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q10: Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?",
    "explanation": "In the 16:9 format of Image B, the bear’s legs and tree lines are not cut off by the added elements, as the image maintains proper framing and composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
