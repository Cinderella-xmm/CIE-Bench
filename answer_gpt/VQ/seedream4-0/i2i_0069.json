      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen emerge naturally from the phone without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic projection appears to be emanating from the phone. The integration seems smooth, aligning with the phone's orientation to give a visual impression that the screen is extending outwards realistically. This does not interrupt the image's visual flow as the elements appear coherent and cohesive.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or unnatural colors where the holographic screen connects with the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the connection between the holographic screen and the phone appears seamless. The transition uses complementary colors that align with the image's overall color scheme, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural hues at the junction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dimensions of the holographic projection screen match the scale of the surrounding objects in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size of the holographic screen seems proportional to the phone and other elements such as the sandwich. The dimensions make it appear realistic and consistent with the environment, which does not look out of place in relation to the other objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the overall texture and detail of the sandwich been preserved despite the addition of the holographic screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandwich in Image B maintains considerable detail and texture, similar to what we would expect if viewing a real sandwich. The presence of the holographic screen does not obscure or detract from the visible details and textures, thus preserving its original appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background remain consistent and undistorted by the addition of the holographic projection screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements appear consistent and unaffected by the addition of the holographic projection screen. There are no visible distortions or inconsistencies introduced into the scene, allowing for a harmonious composition with the new element included.",
