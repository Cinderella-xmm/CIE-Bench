      "question": "Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To answer this question, I need to examine the ornate details in the frosted crystal frame featured in Image B. The floral crest and side columns in Image B appear well-defined with intricate carving details intact, similar to those typically seen in a wooden clock design made with such attention to detail. This suggests that the shapes have been accurately preserved in the transition to the crystal material without warping or flattening. Therefore, the visual integrity of the carved details is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Roman numerals on the crystal clock face appear evenly spaced and legible. Maintaining alignment with the original hour positions is essential for functional and aesthetic purposes. The numbers are clear and follow the traditional clock format, corresponding with the expected layout seen in standard and decorative timepieces. This indicates good design adherence to the original setup without altering their positions.",

      "question": "Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a faceted crystal pendulum that exhibits symmetry in its design, suggesting careful craftsmanship. The pendulum is seen hanging from chains, which indicates proper suspension as expected in traditional pendulum clocks. There are no visual cues of it floating or any awkward angles that suggest misalignment, thus ensuring the design and assembly reflect practical application and attention to detail.",

      "question": "Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a white marble wall that presents a polished and uniform texture. The absence of visible stitches or artificial lines suggests a seamless design. Additionally, the shadow cast underneath the clock appears soft and natural, complementing the wall's material texture and enhancing the image's realism. This careful presentation maintains the wall's continuous aesthetic without any noticeable interference.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal components such as the frame, clock face, and pendulum appear cohesively integrated. The transitions between these parts are smooth with no visible gaps or material inconsistencies. The reflections on the crystal components are consistent with the material's natural reflective properties, without producing unnatural or distorted effects. This indicates a well-executed design emphasizing seamless integration between the parts.",
