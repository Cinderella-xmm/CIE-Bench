    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the outlines around each rose petal uniform, continuous, and free of pixelation or irregular breaks that would indicate an unnatural transition from organic form to mosaic pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines around each rose petal appear to be constructed with the intention of mimicking a mosaic pattern. The lines exhibit the characteristics of continuous, uniform outlines typical in mosaics, with distinct separation between each piece, which suggests intentional design rather than unintended pixelation. This indicates that the transition from the organic form in Image A to the mosaic pattern in Image B was deliberate and well-executed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the petals exhibit smooth transitions between light and dark areas consistent with pearl-like reflectivity, and do the leaves show subtle jade-like translucency without visible texture distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays petals that are designed to look like mosaic pieces using reflective materials such as pearls, showing transitions between light and dark areas. The leaves mimic jade-like qualities with subtle transparency and color variations, avoiding texture distortions. The cohesive design suggests a successful representation of pearl and jade textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the architectural features like the arched window and corner pilasters preserved in shape and proportion despite being converted into terracotta-colored tiles, and do they align seamlessly with adjacent mosaic sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure of the building remains clear despite the conversion into a mosaic style. The arched window and pilasters retain their shapes and proportions, and the terracotta-colored tiles are carefully aligned to match the architectural elements, indicating an accurate representation from Image A to Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mosaic rose bush maintain correct spatial placement relative to the building behind it, with no floating or misplaced elements suggesting incorrect depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the rose bush fits naturally in front of the building. Image B maintains the perceived depth relationship that Image A establishes, as the roses do not appear to be misplaced or floating. The arrangement of the mosaic elements adheres to the same perspective observed in the original image, indicating proper spatial alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as petal layers, leaf venation, and brick joints preserved in a stylized yet coherent manner, without appearing smeared, distorted, or replaced by flat, featureless surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into a mosaic style preserves the intricate details from Image A. Petal layers, leaf veins, and brick joints remain visible and are executed in a detailed, stylized form that remains coherent. These elements are stylized but are not smeared or flat, preserving the detailed essence of the original image.",
