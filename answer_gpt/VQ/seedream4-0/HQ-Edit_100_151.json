      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's coat is depicted in a watercolor style. The coat maintains natural folds, which are typical of how fabric behaves, and there are no visible distortions or broken seams. The texture and details are consistent with how watercolor art captures the essence of clothing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are depicted with pastel tones which blend softly and evenly, characteristic of watercolor. There are no visible signs of color bleeding, and the balloons retain highlights that suggest light reflection, consistent with their rounded surfaces.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s right hand is illustrated to hold the balloons with five fingers visible. The fingers appear naturally jointed and aligned, which is critical in maintaining anatomical realism, even in a watercolor style.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wheat field with a consistent watercolor texture that allows the individual stalks to be visible. The strokes do not appear unnatural or disruptive, maintaining a natural flow that aligns with how fields are typically represented.",
