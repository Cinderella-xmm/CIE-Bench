    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the newly added mission control elements (such as consoles, screens, or panels) geometrically consistent with the room's perspective and do not appear to float or clip through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mission control elements, such as consoles, screens, or panels, are displayed in the background. Based on the visual cues, these elements are consistent with the perspective of a typical space mission control room. They are presented in a manner that follows the perspective, with tables and monitors arranged logically within the space, contributing to the scene's authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the color-coded sections for training stages (e.g., Physical Training, Technical Skills) have clean edges and are they positioned so they do not overlap or obscure the astronaut’s suit or feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color-coded sections are positioned at the bottom of the image and have clean edges. They are separate from the central figure of the astronaut and do not overlap or obscure the suit or feet, ensuring a visually clear presentation of information.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative icons (e.g., treadmill, simulator) proportionally sized and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut so they do not appear oversized or misplaced in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icons are proportionally sized relative to the text and color-coded sections they accompany. They are placed within these sections at a suitable distance from the astronaut, maintaining a balanced composition that does not detract from the main figure or appear misplaced.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the explanatory text for each training stage clearly readable, properly aligned, and not overlapping with the astronaut’s body or suit components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explanatory text for each training stage is clearly readable and properly aligned within the respective color-coded sections. There is no overlap with the astronaut's body or suit components, ensuring it is legible and neatly presented.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s suit joints (e.g., elbows, knees), gloves, and helmet fully intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's suit, including joints like elbows and knees, gloves, and helmet, appears intact with detailed textures. There is no distortion or warping visible, which indicates attention to detail in maintaining the integrity of the suit throughout the editing process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the added mission control elements (e.g., consoles, icons) align with the direction of the original ceiling lighting and do not contradict the existing shadow patterns on the floor and astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the mission control elements are seamlessly integrated into the background, the focus of the analysis is on whether shadow consistency is maintained. The indoor setting with ceiling lighting typically implies a fairly consistent light direction, although specific shadows from added elements may not be distinctly visible due to the background's nature and the absence of explicit shadow casting. The scene appears cohesive overall, suggesting no contradiction.",
