      "question": "Are the sugar-crusted armor details on the donut surfaces uniform and free from unnatural pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut characters are depicted with detailed sugary textures on their surfaces, mimicking armor. These details appear consistent and uniform, with no noticeable pixelation or repeated patterns that would suggest artificial manipulation. The texture is evenly spread across each donut, similar to how sugar would naturally coat a surface.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The limbs are proportionate and integrated into the character design fluidly.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The icing eyes on the donuts in Image B are positioned where the faces would naturally appear on a character, fitting within the curved structure of the donuts. These are well-aligned with the dough, appearing as part of the characterâ€™s expression without seeming detached or inaccurately placed.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coffee mug fortress in Image B is depicted at a reasonable scale compared to the donut characters. It is illustrated like a fort that the characters are surrounding and defending, maintaining a consistent scale and logical placement within the comic panel, which suggests an intended comic and fantastical environment.",
