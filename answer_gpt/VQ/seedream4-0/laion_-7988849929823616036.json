      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the suit jacket follow the contours of the lapels and shoulders without visible distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral pattern on the suit jacket is vibrant and displays a variety of colors and floral designs. The pattern adheres well to the contours of the jacket, following the natural curves and lines of the lapels and shoulders without any noticeable distortion or misalignment. This suggests that the floral pattern has been applied with careful attention to the garment's shape. Such accuracy in alignment requires precise application of the pattern to maintain the integrity of the garment's design.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dotted texture in the background appears to be evenly spaced and consistent in terms of size and density.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Due to the blurred editing applied to the face in the images, an assessment of the facial features, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, is not possible as they are obscured. Hence, this question cannot be answered based on the visible information.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadowing on the floral suit and graphic bow tie appear consistent with the overall image. The designs maintain uniform brightness relative to the white shirt and the textured background, without any unnatural highlights or noticeably flat areas. This consistency suggests that the lighting on the clothing has been adjusted to match the surroundings, contributing to a cohesive look.",
