      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is rendered in a crystal-like material with distinct facets. The facets appear to be carefully crafted and aligned to replicate the panel lines of the original truck shown in Image A, following the general contour and shape of the original vehicle's body. There are no visible breaks or misalignment observed which indicates a precise alignment and craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the wheels made of crystal have a consistent appearance in terms of size and spacing compared to the original wheels in Image A. The alignment with the truck body suggests the axles are positioned similarly, and there are no signs of components appearing to float or be misplaced. This indicates careful attention to maintaining the realism of the vehicle's wheels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels feature detailed lattice-like structures within the crystal, which corresponds to the intricate design needed to mimic the hubs and rims from Image A. These internal details are smoothly integrated, without any jagged edges or inconsistencies, reflecting the attention to detail in recreating the wheel's structure as accurately as possible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the truck resting on a white marble platform. The platform appears flat and continuous, providing uniform support across the entire underside of the truck. There are no visible gaps, and the truck does not appear to have floating sections due to its position and the platform's solid appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal surfaces in Image B show a play of colors that includes shades typical of emerald and jade, due to the refraction and reflection effects. The colors are subtly blended, avoiding over-saturation or unnatural glowing effects, maintaining a realistic representation of these precious materials. The lack of excessive chromatic aberration further contributes to the authentic appearance of the material.",
