    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is anthropomorphized but does not have traditional facial features like eyes or a mouth. Instead, it uses arms to gesture, with speech bubbles for expression. This design choice ensures that the numerals and subdials remain unobscured and the metallic texture is unaffected, avoiding unnatural shading or edges around fictitious facial features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the detective desk and magnifying glass proportionally sized relative to the watch, and are they rendered with consistent line weight and shading that matches the comic style without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The styling of the detective desk and magnifying glass in Image B appears to be well-integrated with the watch character. The proportions of the items are consistent with a typical comic style, exhibiting uniform line weight and shading that complements the cartoon depiction without noticeable distortion. This demonstrates a coherent artistic approach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the background elements (cluttered office items) appear spatially coherent with the watch, showing correct layering and perspective without overlapping or clipping through the watch's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the office background, including various cluttered items typical of a detective's office, appears well-aligned and appropriately layered in relation to the watch character. The perspective is consistent, and there are no visible issues with elements overlapping or clipping through, indicating thoughtful placement and rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tick mark sound effects uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered around the dial, without jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Tick mark sound effects are not apparent on the watch's dial in Image B. Instead, specific comic effects and expressions are included, particularly in speech bubbles. Thus, the judgment is based on the overall presentation of effects, which maintain a clean, consistent comic style without imperfections like jagged edges or smudging.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the stylized version retain the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case, with no visible texture warping or color inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains the original color and texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver case from Image A. Despite the stylization, these elements are preserved with no noticeable warping or color inconsistencies. The essential material characteristics remain intact, maintaining accuracy in texture depiction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hour, minute hands, subdials, and date window remain unchanged from Image A, maintaining their original positions and proportions. The design refrains from additional facial features that could obscure these elements, ensuring clarity and readability are preserved.",
