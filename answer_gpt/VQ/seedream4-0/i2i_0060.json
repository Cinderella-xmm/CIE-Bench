    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the elements of the image, such as the elephant and its environment, unaltered and maintain their original natural appearance without any artifacts introduced in the edit?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the food is arranged meticulously with carrot pieces and a meat roll, hinting at deliberate styling for aesthetic presentation. This suggests edits for artistic effect rather than maintaining a natural appearance, contrasting significantly with Image A which features an elephant in a natural setting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the elements within the image appear natural and consistent with the original, such as the roughness of the elephantâ€™s skin and the details of the hay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited Image B visually represents a decorated dish with carrots and a meat roll, without direct correlation to the natural textures of elements like an elephant or hay. The textures like the sheen of the meat and smoothness of carrots are altered for culinary representation, unlike Image A which showcases natural textures.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical features of the elephant and its surroundings, like the hay bale and enclosure, depicted accurately and without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is centered around culinary proportions with carrot pieces and a meat roll, disregarding any depiction of an elephant or its environment. This artistic presentation is different from the animal and environmental setting in Image A, which upholds realistic proportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the subtle lines and wrinkles on the elephant's skin and the strands of hay, been preserved without any degradation or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is constructed with a focus on food arrangement rather than preservation of fine natural details such as skin wrinkles or hay strands. The culinary presentation introduces textures non-representative of those found in natural settings depicted in Image A.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the image, including the placement of the elephant, the hay bale, and the enclosure, maintain visual credibility and alignment with the expected scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B focuses on the composition of a plate with carrots and a meat roll rather than an environment involving an elephant, hay bale, and enclosure. This edited scene does not align with the expected setup seen in Image A, which depicts an animal within its habitat.",
