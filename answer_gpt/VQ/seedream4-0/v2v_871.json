      "question": "Do the added LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design appear naturally integrated into the scene without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure and the pear-inspired animal design appear seamlessly integrated into the scene. The textures and colors of both the minifigures are consistent with typical LEGO design elements, showing smooth surfaces and vibrant, uniform colors, as would be expected in LEGO figures. Careful observation reveals no visible signs of digital manipulation or artifacts around the figures, indicating that they blend naturally with the surrounding scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the LEGO minifigure and pear-inspired animal design logically consistent with the size and scale of the pear and smartphone in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the LEGO minifigure and the pear-inspired animal provide visual cues of expected proportions for LEGO figures relative to objects like the pear. Their size appears reasonable when compared to the pear's size and the wooden cube's dimensions within the glass display. Typically, LEGO minifigures are designed to resemble a scale relatable to real-world objects when they're part of a miniature scene or set. Since they don't overshadow the pear or appear diminutive, the proportionality is maintained consistently with real-world scale ratios, enhancing believability.",

      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the glass cube, matte black base, and nameplate retain their natural appearance and fine details without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube in Image B is clear and reflective, showing realistic refraction and clarity typical of glass enclosures, with no distortion or pixelation that could indicate editing. The matte black base appears smooth, with consistent coloring and no anomalies, while the nameplate shows fine detailing in inscriptions, suggesting precise workmanship. These features confirm that the materials and textures are well-rendered and free from noticeable editing artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the placement of the LEGO minifigure, pear-inspired animal, and nameplate within the transparent glass cube create a visually coherent and plausible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a logical and organized spatial arrangement where the LEGO minifigure, pear-inspired animal, and the pear are correctly scaled and proportioned within the confines of the cube. This ordered placement makes for a visually coherent scene, with each element given space that allows for clear viewing through the glass without obstruction. The nameplate positioned on the base of the cube further anchors the composition, creating a balanced and visually appealing setup.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and background color transition from a soft caramel shade to a gentle cream tone enhance the natural appearance and authenticity of the wooden surface and other elements in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition in background color from a soft caramel to a gentle cream in Image B provides a warm and harmonious backdrop that complements the wooden surface below the glass display. Such gradient lighting gives the scene depth and warmth, evoking realism and contributing to the overall aesthetic quality. The softness of the transition maintains the visual coherence of elements within the image, reinforcing their natural appearance and authenticity effectively.",
