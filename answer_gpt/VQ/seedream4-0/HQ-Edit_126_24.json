    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the bioluminescent mushrooms in the mid-ground and foreground have smooth, continuous surfaces without pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mushrooms display a glowing, smooth, and uniform surface which appears free from pixelation or edge artifacts. The bioluminescent effect is consistent and enhances their mystical appearance, without distortion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the transformed tree trunks (left and right sides) geometrically coherent and smoothly integrated into the bark texture without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The features on the transformed tree trunks in Image B appear to be integrated into the bark texture, but the editing results in some noticeable seams and distortions, indicating that the blend is not entirely smooth.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the iridescent wings of the fairy creatures near the stream and on rocks show smooth color transitions and uniform transparency without pixelation or unnatural banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fairy wings in Image B display smooth color transitions and transparency, contributing to their ethereal appearance. The gradation of colors lacks pixelation or banding, suggesting skilled editing.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the silver mist flow naturally over the mossy rocks and around the streambed, maintaining consistent opacity and avoiding abrupt changes in density or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver mist flows smoothly over the terrain, maintaining consistent opacity. It integrates well with the environment, showing no abrupt texture or density changes, which supports a naturalistic effect.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (mushrooms and will-o'-wisps) emit soft light that casts subtle shadows and blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh highlights or disconnected glow zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing elements in Image B emit soft, diffused light that blends with the ambient environment. The light creates subtle shadows and avoids harsh highlights or disconnected glow zones, enhancing the mystical ambiance.",
