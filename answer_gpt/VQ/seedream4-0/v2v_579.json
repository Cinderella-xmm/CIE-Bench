      "question": "Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green block is transformed into a chibi-style form where it is now rectangular and made to resemble a gift box with a rose on top. The overall geometric form is altered to fit the aesthetic style, which prioritizes cuteness and simplification over precise geometric shapes found in the original block form.",

      "question": "Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks are creatively redesigned into heart-shaped characters with eyes and limbs, giving them a lively and dynamic appearance. These new characters are free from unnatural textures and are purposefully transformed to fit the playful and cute chibi style rather than maintaining their original structural integrity.",

      "question": "Does the transformed background with soft pastel colors blend naturally with the foreground elements without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B uses soft pastel colors that complement the chibi-style characters and blend well with the thematic elements such as heart shapes and the color palette. There are no noticeable artifacts that disrupt the visual cohesion between the background and the foreground elements.",

      "question": "Are the heart-shaped confetti elements evenly distributed and visually plausible without causing any loss of detail in the surrounding blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped confetti elements in Image B are scattered throughout the scene but are not overwhelming or irregular. Their distribution does not result in a loss of detail in the surrounding elements, as the characters and other design aspects are distinct and clear.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the red heart characters and the green block-turned-gift have been transformed into a consistent chibi aesthetic, characterized by simple shapes, vibrant colors, and a cute, stylized appearance. There are no inconsistencies in style or texture across these elements in Image B.",
