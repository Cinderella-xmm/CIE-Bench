    "Question": "Q2: Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
    "explanation": "The patterns and bright neon colors in Image B seem to be consistently applied in a way that reflects the intricate geometric designs and other elements consistent with optical art and street murals. However, the layout isn't repeated in a patterned way across the surface of the mural; rather, it forms a singular, cohesive artwork designed to fit within the specific section of the wall.",
