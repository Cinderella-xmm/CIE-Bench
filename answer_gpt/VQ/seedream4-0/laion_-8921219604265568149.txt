    "Question": "Q1: Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
    "explanation": "The façade of the cathedral in Image B appears uniformly smooth and lacks the intricate textures and depth associated with stone. The edited image presents a resin-like material that gives the structure a plastic appearance, contrasting with the original's detailed stone texture. This smooth surface is indicative of a model or miniature, confirming the editing style.",
    "answer": "No"

They are neither excessively large nor small, harmoniously fitting into the scene without distortion. The figures' placement suggests careful consideration of scale and positioning, preserving the overall aesthetic.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
    "explanation": "The lamps in Image B emit a light that is appropriate for their miniature size, casting soft, localized illumination. There is no evidence of excessive glow or light reaching areas that should remain shadowed, which is consistent with their physical characteristics and positioning in the scene, adding realism to the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
