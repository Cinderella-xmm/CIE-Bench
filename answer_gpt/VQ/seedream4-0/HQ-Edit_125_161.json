      "question": "Does the lattice-like scale pattern along the serpent's body follow the spiral curve smoothly without abrupt breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body wraps around the staircase, following its spiral curve. By observing the scale pattern, we can note that it closely adheres to the curve of the staircase, maintaining continuity in appearance. This smoothness indicates a careful design to match the serpent's scales with the curvature of the structure. Therefore, there are no apparent abrupt breaks or misalignments in the scale pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the individual segments of the serpent's body aligned with the original stair treads such that each segment corresponds to a step in size and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent is wrapped around the staircase, and by examining the alignment, there is a consistent spacing that seems to correspond with the stairs' treads. The visual consistency with the positioning of the body relative to the steps of the staircase supports this alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the translucent fins extend from the original railing position in a continuous, flowing manner without gaps or distortions in their shape or placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, translucent fins emerge from the serpent's body, which intertwines with the railing and stair structure. The fins appear to be placed smoothly without any gaps or distortion, maintaining a harmonious flow with the surrounding elements like the railings and the spiral shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting and shading of the original staircase surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s body displays a marble-like texture. Considering the lighting and shading of the staircase, the texture appears consistent and evenly spread across the serpent's surface, matching the lighting and shading of the environment without strong discrepancies. This uniformity in appearance suggests an effort to maintain consistency with the staircase's texture.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s head positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase without overlapping or deforming the surrounding wall or ceiling structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent’s head is prominently positioned at the top of the staircase. It fits comfortably within the circular opening created by the staircase's curve, without overlapping into the walls or ceiling. This attention to spatial arrangement ensures that the serpent’s head is placed without deforming or disrupting the surrounding architectural features.",
