      "question": "Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy versions of the chicken wings are simplified and stylized, and do not retain the detailed anatomical shape of real wings. The plush versions lack distinct joint areas and wing tips. Instead, they are more uniform in shape and appear rounded without fine detailing, representing a more abstract or stylized form of chicken wings.",

      "question": "Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowl’s edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bright orange pillow inside the white bowl appears to fit well without causing any distortion or bulging of the bowl’s edges. The pillow is scaled to match the bowl’s size, sitting comfortably within it, which indicates that it is properly shaped and scaled to fit the bowl.",

      "question": "Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B appears light-colored and uniformly smooth. It gives a consistent texture that suggests a wooden surface with subtle wood grain. There are no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts, contributing to the appearance of a natural wood surface.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden-brown fabric of the plush wings in Image B appears soft and plush, typical of textile materials. It does not display a raised or granular texture that would suggest a crunchy feel, which would be inconsistent with soft fabric materials. The plush appearance is consistent with the expected softness of toy or cushion materials rather than a crunchy food texture.",

      "question": "Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and Image B, the original sauce and the orange pillow are positioned in the same bowl relative to the plate and wings, maintaining consistent alignment. The pillow appears neatly placed within the bowl and does not overlap or appear to be above the plate, indicating proper positioning in alignment with the original.",
