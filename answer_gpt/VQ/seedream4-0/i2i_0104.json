      "question": "Does the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" introduce any unnatural textures or visibly distorted areas on the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Warm Home' is placed above the cat's head, and 'Adopt Love' is placed below, neither directly overlapping with the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes. The absence of direct overlap suggests that no unnatural textures or visibly distorted areas on these regions are introduced by the text.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" maintain structural consistency and avoid disrupting the proportions and physical rationality of the cat's face and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Warm Home' and 'Adopt Love' is strategically placed above and below the cat's face, avoiding any interruption or distortion of the cat's face and body's structure. The placement respects the natural boundaries and proportions of the cat, ensuring that the physical depiction remains consistent and rational.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the natural appearance and authenticity of the cat's expression, fur pattern, and posture been preserved despite the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of text does not interfere with the visible areas of the cat's expression, fur pattern, or posture. The natural appearance is maintained entirely, as the text is situated away from these elements, allowing the original posture and detail to remain unaffected.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the cat, such as individual strands of fur, whiskers, and paw pads, free from blurring or pixelation after the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details such as individual strands of fur, whiskers, and visible parts of the paw pads remain sharp and clear, indicating no introduction of blurring or pixelation resulting from the text addition. The text's placement does not alter these aspects, preserving their crispness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" into the image avoid logical inconsistencies such as overlapping unnaturally with the cat's fur or appearing embedded in a way that defies common sense?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text integration is done in a manner that respects the image's natural flow, positioned in areas above and below the cat that avoid unnatural overlap with the fur or whiskers. There is no appearance of the text being embedded in a nonsensical manner, maintaining logical consistency within the image.",
