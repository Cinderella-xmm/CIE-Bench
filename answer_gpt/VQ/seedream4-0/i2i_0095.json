      "question": "Does the word 'Shine' appear seamlessly integrated into the mirror with no visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' appears in the mirror. To assess seamless integration, one should look at the edges of the text, checking for any irregularities or unnatural borders that might suggest poor editing. In this case, the word 'Shine' seems to blend well with the mirror, without visible jagged edges or discrepancies from the mirror's reflection. This suggests a seamless integration into the surface of the mirror.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and glow effect of the word 'Shine' consistent with the aesthetic of the bathroom and does not look out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Shine' has a glow effect that is similar to backlighting often used around bathroom mirrors for a contemporary look. The overall aesthetic of the bathroom is modern and minimalistic, with clean lines and muted colors. The glowing text matches this style well, appearing as if it is part of the bathroom’s design rather than an odd addition. The soft glow complements the illumination around the mirror, maintaining stylistic consistency.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the word 'Shine' maintain the mirror's original shape and proportions, avoiding any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When comparing Image B with Image A, the mirror's rectangular shape and proportions remain unchanged despite the addition of the word 'Shine'. The reflection properties and dimensions of the mirror do not appear altered. This indicates that the addition did not cause any distortive effects on the mirror’s geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reflective properties of the mirror undisturbed by the addition of 'Shine', preserving the clarity and detail of the mirror’s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the word 'Shine' is on the mirror, there are no obvious disruptions to the reflective qualities and clarity that mirrors exhibit. The addition seems to be an overlay that does not interfere with the surface's ability to reflect light and detail. This maintains the mirror’s innate function while incorporating decorative text.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning, size, and lighting of the word 'Shine' seem authentic, enhancing rather than detracting from the visual credibility of the bathroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Shine' is centered on the mirror, an aesthetically balanced choice that contributes to the symmetrical and organized design of the bathroom. The size of the text is proportionate, neither too large to overwhelm the mirror nor too small to be overlooked. The lighting of the text, with a glow, mirrors the illumination style generally used in such minimalist-modern decors, ensuring that it enhances the ambient atmosphere rather than detracts from it.",
