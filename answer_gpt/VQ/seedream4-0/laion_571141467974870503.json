      "question": "Are the bold primary colors applied to the train's body consistent across all surfaces without visible color bleeding or mismatched tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train features vibrant primary colors that are clearly applied in a continuous manner across its body. The colors along all surfaces of the train are distinct and appear intentionally designed in a comic pop-art style. There is no indication of color bleeding or mismatched tones, suggesting controlled and uniform application. In comparison, Image A presents a typical train without this artistic color enhancement, maintaining a realistic look with a mix of practical colors. The contrast shows a conscious effort in Image B to creatively enhance the train with consistently applied bold colors.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the halftone dot patterns on the train display consistent size, spacing, and alignment across all visible panels without distortion or clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's surface incorporates halftone dot patterns that are characteristic of a comic book style. These dots are evenly distributed and maintain consistent size and spacing, contributing to a uniform pattern without distortion or clustering. Halftone patterns are used creatively to add texture to the train, and the evenly dispersed dots ensure a coherent appearance. Image A, lacking this artistic element, features a realistic look with no halftone texture. Thus, Image B maintains a consistent dot pattern across the train's panels.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes used to replace the barn’s wood texture aligned with the original architectural elements such as windows, doors, and roofline without breaking their structural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the barn using geometric shapes and bold colors. Upon analysis, these shapes appear to align well with the architectural elements such as windows, doors, and the roofline. The original structure is preserved with these elements' boundaries respected, which ensures the barn's distinct architectural features remain recognizable despite the creative modification. Image A provides a realistic depiction of the barn's wood texture, underscoring the artistic liberties taken in Image B. Despite the transformation, the structural integrity in terms of boundary alignment is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the graphic bursts representing foliage positioned in a way that respects the original spatial layout, with no overlapping or misplaced elements that contradict the scene’s depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the artistic rendition of foliage through graphic bursts is thoughtfully positioned. These bursts maintain the spatial layout similar to Image A, accurately representing where foliage would be based on the scene's depth perception. The graphical elements are strategically placed to convey a sense of depth without conflicting with the scene's original spatial relationships. Image A shows the realistic placement of trees and bushes, and Image B mirrors this arrangement creatively without disrupting the scene’s depth.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the black outlines around the train, barn, and foliage uniformly sharp, continuous, and free from gaps or misalignments at object edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black outlines in Image B are a stylistic choice, giving the image a comic book appearance. These outlines around the train, barn, and foliage are uniformly sharp and continuous, following the edges of the objects meticulously, which is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the comic style. No visible gaps or misalignments exist, ensuring the objects’ boundaries are distinctly defined. Image A lacks these outlines because it aims for realism, highlighting how Image B uses them effectively for emphasis and artistic coherence.",
