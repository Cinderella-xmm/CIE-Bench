    "Question": "Q1: Is the entire cityscape and car enclosed within a transparent, geometrically perfect cube with consistent refractive qualities that distort surrounding elements naturally?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers and car appear to be enclosed within a transparent cube, which creates visible reflections and some bending of the light. The angles and edges of the cube are sharp and precise. This points to a geometrically perfect cube with refractive qualities that naturally distort the surroundings, which are typical of clear glass or acrylic materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the car's surface exhibit a uniform, high-quality metallic texture with natural reflections and no artifacts like blotches, smudges, or missing specular highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car's surface shows a smooth metallic finish that reflects light naturally without inconsistencies. There are no visible artifacts like blotches or smudges, and the specular highlights appear consistent with a high-quality surface texture, indicating careful digital rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the skyscrapers scaled down uniformly and proportionally without geometric distortions such as stretched windows, skewed angles, or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "The skyscrapers in Image B appear miniaturized but retain accurate proportions relative to the cube's scaling. There are no visible distortions in window shapes or building angles, and the edges are sharp and intact. This uniform scaling is essential in digital modeling when objects are proportionally reduced.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the windows of the skyscrapers display small, consistent, and physically plausible light points resembling micro LEDs without haloing, bleeding, or unnatural brightness?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases windows with small points of light that consistently mimic micro LEDs. These lights are evenly spaced and maintain a uniform brightness, free from haloing or bleeding effects, suggesting a realistic depicture of illuminated windows in miniature city modeling.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the trees feature finely detailed, dense green foliage with natural color variation and no pixelation or blocky rendering, indicating proper micro-scale modeling?",
    "explanation": "The trees visible in Image B show detailed foliage with variations in green hues, implying realistic modeling at the micro-scale. The rendering is smooth and free from pixelation or blockiness, highlighting advanced texturing techniques suitable for detailed landscape models.",
    "answer": "Yes"
