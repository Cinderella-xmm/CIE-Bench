    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horseâ€™s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent showcase box appears well-aligned with the horse's outline. The edges are straight and there are no visible distortions in the form of warped edges or double images. The light refraction seems natural and does not distort the view of the horse. Based on these observations, the box is properly aligned with the horse sculpture, maintaining visual clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents appear consistently colored and polished, which is characteristic of metal. They have uniform reflective properties that are typical of polished surfaces, without showing any unnatural highlights or color bleeding. This suggests a realistic representation of metal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the brand logo clearly legible, properly centered on the black base stand, and free from pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand logo is visible on the showcase box, directly above the black base. The logo is legible and appears clear, with no signs of pixelation or blurring. However, the logo itself is not placed on the black base stand; it is on the box in the front view. The logo placement is more aligned with typical branding placement which is on the box versus on the base itself, thus it does not apply directly to the question about the black base stand.",

      "question": "Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the internal backdrop pattern inside the box shows a uniform pattern consistent with the perspective of the box. It is correctly aligned with the three-dimensional space and does not show any signs of warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges. The alignment and continuity of the pattern indicate a successful integration into the box's perspective.",

      "question": "Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnetic closure mechanism is visibly integrated into the structure of the box, with gold accents indicating the closure points. They appear properly attached and aligned with no visible gaps or overlaps that would suggest mechanical impossibility. The design and integration seem feasible within the physical structure of the box.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all visible parts of the horse sculpture (including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas) clearly preserved and unobscured by the added packaging elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse sculpture is fully visible within the transparent showcase box. The head, legs, saddle, and painted areas are unobscured and clearly visible. The packaging elements, such as the box and its features, do not obscure any part of the sculpture, allowing for full preservation of its view.",
