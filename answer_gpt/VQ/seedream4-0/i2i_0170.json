      "question": "Are the clothing and bags of both women depicted with soft gradient blocks that retain their original shapes and proportions without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and bags are illustrated in a simplistic, vector-style with flat colors and no gradients. The shapes and proportions are maintained accurately, consistent with the original shapes in Image A. There are no unnatural artifacts introduced during this conversion, demonstrating a well-executed transition from photograph to illustration.",

      "question": "Do the mannequins and their outfits inside the store window appear structurally coherent and visually plausible in terms of shape and material after the style conversion, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the mannequins and their outfits in a clear and structured manner, using simplified outlines and colors typical of a vector style. The visual appearance remains coherent, maintaining the original concept from Image A. Thus, the mannequins are depicted as structurally sound and free from any distortion or unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Does the storefront maintain its original architectural details, such as the frame and tiles, without any visible distortion or introduction of non-natural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has translated the architectural details of the storefront, such as the frame, into a clean and simplistic style without noticeable loss of structure or distortion. The illustration style successfully retains the architectural essence visible in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the cobblestone pavement represented naturally with soft gradients, maintaining the structural integrity and visual coherence without any loss of detail or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone pavement is depicted using a simplified and flat approach without detailed texture. While it lacks detailed intricacies compared to Image A, it maintains structural integrity and visual coherence in line with the illustrative style, appearing natural within the context of the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting effects and shadows in the image convincingly portrayed with soft gradient blocks, ensuring they contribute to the overall realism and natural appearance without breaking the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a shift to an illustrative style that doesn't utilize gradients for shadows or lighting effects. It opts for a flat color representation which, although different from the photo-realistic lighting of Image A, does not break visual flow due to its consistent art style. The overall appearance remains cohesive and appropriate for the illustration format.",
