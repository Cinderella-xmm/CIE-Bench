      "question": "Do the transformed plants maintain recognizable plant-like structures without unnatural appendages or disproportionate body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed plants appear as fantastical creatures with features such as glowing orbs and are creatively designed. These structures deviate from recognizable plant-like structures due to the presence of whimsical elements like floating moss islands and fantasy creatures similar to dragons, which are not typically associated with natural plants. Thus, they possess unnatural appendages and disproportionately creative body parts that reflect a fantasy theme.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vine patterns on the leaves seamlessly blended with the leaf texture, showing no visible edges, clipping, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine patterns appear intricately integrated into the leaf textures of the large ceiling-hanging foliage. The patterns blend well with the natural coloration and texture of the leaves, and there are no visible edges or inconsistencies in the shading. The detailed vine patterns appear to be a natural art within the leaves, suggesting seamless blending.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the magical orbs replace the original flowers in the same positions and emit light that interacts realistically with nearby surfaces and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magical orbs positioned along with the fantasy plant structures appear to replace the flowers, glowing with a soft light. This light seems to interact reasonably well with the surfaces and creates corresponding shadows on the ground, maintaining realism in illumination contrast and shadow placement. The positioning aligns well with the structure of floating plants and emits light in a way consistent with expectations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shelves positioned above the ground with soft shadows beneath them that align with the light source and do not show unnatural gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of shelves, there are floating platforms of moss with fantasy creatures resting upon them. These exhibit a floating effect with deliberate shadows created beneath them, contributing to the mystical visual theme. Since there are no shelves present as in Image A, and they are intentionally designed to appear floating, the answer hinges on understanding this fantastical setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the iridescent foliage cascade from the ceiling in a way that follows the structural lines of the roof frame and allows light to diffuse naturally through its layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The iridescent foliage in Image B cascades beautifully from the ceiling, integrating well with the greenhouse's structural lines. The light diffuses through the cascading layers seamlessly, illustrating realism in light interaction, which suggests natural diffusion and aesthetic harmony with the roof frame. The pattern and light interaction between cascading foliage and frame enhance the enchanting atmosphere inside the greenhouse.",
