    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes added to the pancake surfaces positioned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the size and shape of the pancakes, without deforming the surrounding texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes on the pancake surfaces are placed such that they fit well with the overall dimensions of the pancakes, maintaining a balance in positioning. They are not overly large or small compared to the surface area available. This proportionality ensures that they do not interfere with the texture and shape of the pancakes, which remain intact and recognizable as pancakes with eyes. The placement appears intentional and does not distort the surrounding pancake texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the butter pat still recognizable as a solid block with clean edges and natural lighting, even after being stylized as a hat, without exhibiting warped or fragmented geometry?",
    "explanation": "The butter pat in Image B is stylized as a hat placed on top of the pancake stack. It retains its clear geometric form with defined edges and the natural lighting gives it a realistic appearance. The stylization does not compromise its structural integrity or recognizability as a butter pat, as it maintains clean lines and a uniform look.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the syrup stream extend downward from the pancake stack in a continuous, smooth arc without abrupt breaks, pixelation, or unnatural viscosity that contradicts liquid behavior?",
    "explanation": "The syrup stream in Image B is depicted as a smooth, continuous arc flowing from the pancake stack. It shows natural liquid behavior with no noticeable breaks, pixelation, or clumping that would suggest any unnatural viscosity. This creates a visually appealing and realistic representation of flowing syrup.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the added breakfast items (e.g., coffee cups, scrambled eggs) aligned with the depth and lighting of the original scene, maintaining consistent shadows and scale relative to the pancake stack?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the added breakfast items like the coffee cup and scrambled eggs are placed consistently within the scene's perspective. They match the lighting and shadowing conditions to appear natural against the pancake stack. Their scales are proportionate, with no discordance in size that would make them appear out of place or disproportionate within the tableau.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the speech bubbles and text boxes positioned in open areas of the frame without overlapping critical elements such as the pancake stack or syrup stream, and do they have clear, legible letterforms without jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles and text boxes are carefully placed to avoid overlapping crucial visual elements like the pancake stack or syrup stream. They occupy open areas in the scene, allowing the viewer to read the text without obstruction. The letterforms within these bubbles are clear, smooth, and legible, free from any jagged edges that might reduce readability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
