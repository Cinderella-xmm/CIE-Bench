      "question": "Is the lens area transformed into eyes with smooth, symmetrical shapes and natural-looking reflections, without jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens area of the camera has been edited to resemble a pair of eyes. The shapes are smooth and symmetrical, typical of a cartoon character design. The reflections appear natural and consistent with how light interacts with circular surfaces. There are no jagged edges present, and the lighting is uniform, supporting the cartoon aesthetic.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jungle background surrounds the edited camera character. The edges where the camera meets the jungle area are smooth, without visible outlines that disrupt the visual experience. There is no noticeable pixelation or color bleeding, ensuring the background complements the camera character seamlessly in the cartoon setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tagline “Capture every quest!” in Image B is prominently displayed. It uses a stylized font that fits the cartoon theme effectively. Its placement does not cover any significant part of the camera, allowing both the camera details and the tagline to be clearly visible, contributing to the overall design without interference.",
