      "question": "Do the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay have proportionally correct limbs and body structures that maintain anatomical plausibility without visible deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardinal and blue jay are anthropomorphized as they are dressed in Victorian garments, yet the limbs and body structure are consistent with the nature of birds. Their limbs and body structures appear proportionally appropriate for birds wearing human-style clothing. Despite the creative concept, there are no visible deformations or disproportions that stand out, maintaining anatomical plausibility within the depicted scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay rendered with clear, consistent texture and stitching, free from pixelation, blurring, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Victorian garments in Image B are rendered with attention to detail and consistent texture. The stitching and fabric patterns are clear and coherent throughout both outfits. There is no evidence of pixelation, blurring, or inconsistencies in material rendering, allowing the garments to appear realistic and cohesive within the artistic context of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the miniature stage and alcove elements positioned with proper depth and alignment, and do icicles and pine accents adhere to gravitational and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature stage and alcove where the cardinal and blue jay are displayed appear well-aligned, giving a sense of depth. The icicles hanging down and pine accents placed laterally follow gravitational principles, contributing to the realism of the scene. Spatial logic is maintained throughout, supporting the intended depth perception and arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all miniature seasonal elements (e.g., ornaments, snowflakes) properly scaled, cast realistic shadows, and aligned with the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature seasonal elements in Image B, including ornaments and snowflakes, appear to be properly scaled in relation to the main figures and environment. They cast shadows that align with the light source direction, which is consistent with how light would interact with such objects, reflecting a realistic rendering considering the scene setup.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the split-frame border clean and seamless, with no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding at the boundary between the two scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a split-frame border like in Image A, but rather a single, cohesive scene involving the cardinal and blue jay dressed in Victorian garments. Therefore, there are no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding to consider, as there is no scene split present in this image.",
