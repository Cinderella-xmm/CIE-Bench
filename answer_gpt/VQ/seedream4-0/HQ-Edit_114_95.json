    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass-like surface of the transformed Eiffel Tower show natural transparency and subtle reflections consistent with real glass under overcast lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is transformed into a glass-like structure that mimics a perfume bottle with its transparent characteristics. The subtle reflections and clarity of the object suggest transparency akin to real glass, especially under an overcast sky, where such reflections would be subdued. The lighting seems consistent with expectations for glass - diffuse and understated in an overcast environment, indicating a realistic portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed patterns on the glass surface aligned with the original lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower and proportionally consistent across all levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the glass surface maintains embossed patterns that replicate the lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower. These patterns are consistently proportional and aligned with each level of the tower, mirroring the original structure's design. The transformation respects the tower's inherent proportions, ensuring alignment across its form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold-plated base positioned correctly at the bottom of the tower, with smooth edges and consistent metallic texture that matches the scale and lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold-plated base appears precisely positioned at the bottom of the bottle-shaped Eiffel Tower. It features smooth edges and shows consistent metallic texture, matching the expected lighting and scale of the scene. The placement and texture are coherent with conventional design principles for adding bases to glass structures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Parisian skyline motif visible along the glass surface without distorting the tower’s shape or appearing as a floating or disconnected element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Parisian skyline motif in Image B is etched or visible along the bottom of the glass surface. It seamlessly integrates into the design without distorting the Eiffel Tower's shape and appears connected to the overall glass structure, avoiding impressions of floating or disconnection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the logo at the neck of the bottle clearly defined, centered, and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo at the neck of the bottle-shaped structure is clear, centered and free from any jagged edges or texture artifacts. The precision allows for clean edges, maintaining a polished and high-quality appearance, which is essential in product advertisements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main structural elements of the tower (legs, arches, central column) preserved in correct proportion and alignment, with no signs of stretching or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the key structural components of the Eiffel Tower—legs, arches, and central column—in their correct proportions and alignment as per the original design. There is no visible stretching or geometric distortion, preserving the architectural integrity of the tower within its new form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible artifacts like pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components. The image maintains a high level of quality with smooth transitions and realistic reflections consistent with the appearance of glass and integrated design elements.",
