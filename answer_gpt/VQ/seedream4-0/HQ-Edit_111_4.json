    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the cactus arms show smooth, continuous segmentation without abrupt breaks or distorted joints, and do the glowing orbs at their ends appear naturally attached and aligned with the limb direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus arms are transformed into tentacle-like structures adorned with glowing orbs at their ends. The arms are segmented with a clear pattern that winds around their length, resembling scales rather than typical cactus ribs. The glowing orbs seem to be naturally affixed at the ends, aligning well with the direction and curvature of the arms, indicating a thoughtful integration in the digital transformation. The continuity and attachment appear smooth without awkward breaks or misalignments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the iridescent scales evenly distributed across the cactus surface, following the original rib pattern without visible seams, repetitive textures, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a cactus with iridescent scales replacing the original ribbed texture. These scales are evenly distributed over the surface, creating a visually cohesive pattern. The colors blend seamlessly without abrupt transitions or unnatural shifts, enhancing the perceived realism of the transformation. This even distribution maintains the integrity of the original rib layout by creating a uniform scaled pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the crystal spine rise vertically from the base of the cactus with consistent facets and internal clarity, maintaining alignment with the original trunk and showing no signs of digital clipping or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal spine in Image B rises prominently from the center of the cactus, maintaining a vertical orientation that aligns with the original trunk axis. The facets of the crystal are consistent and symmetrical, displaying internal clarity and brilliance. There are no visible digital artifacts or clipping issues at the edges, which signifies a careful digital modification that respects the physical constraints and perspective of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the bioluminescent tendrils positioned along the cactusâ€™s surface in a coherent, organic pattern, with consistent thickness and spacing, and do they cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is adorned with bioluminescent tendrils that follow an organic and coherent distribution. The thickness and spacing of these tendrils are consistent, contributing to a natural and integrated appearance. The tendrils emit a soft glow that harmonizes with the ambient lighting conditions, maintaining visual coherence with the overall illumination in the scene.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the transformed cactus fully grounded in the sand, casting a shadow that aligns with the light source and does not show floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the cactus in Image B appears firmly set in the desert landscape, consistent with the shadowing and surrounding sand textures. The cast shadow aligns well with the light source (likely the sun), reflecting a natural continuity with the rest of the environment. There are no indications of floating parts or disconnections, suggesting the transformation is well integrated into the scene.",
