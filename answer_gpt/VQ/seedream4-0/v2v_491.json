      "question": "Does the bear maintain precise proportions and intricate fur details in its anime-inspired form without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is portrayed in an anime-inspired style, resembling a chibi figure. This style intentionally simplifies and exaggerates certain features for a cute effect, often resulting in a lack of precise proportions and detailed textures like fur. This is a common characteristic expected in anime-style figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the bear's fur natural and free of any obvious artifacts in the anime-inspired figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The anime-inspired bear in Image B has smooth, uniform textures typical of plastic sculptures, lacking the realistic furry details one would expect from natural bear fur. This is consistent with the intended design for anime figures, which often forego intricate textures in favor of a stylized appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the backpack realistically scaled down and positioned next to the bear on the desk, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack appears to be appropriately scaled for the desk environment, matching the proportions of the anime-inspired bear figure realistically. It appears to maintain consistent size and proportions with common objects on desks.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bear's emotive eyes retain their fine details and appear natural without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes on the anime-inspired bear in Image B are simplified and do not exhibit the fine detail and natural texture typical of real bear eyes. They are part of the stylized and exaggerated features common in anime figures, which often lack the finer details of real-life textures.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and lighting of the scene, including the bear and the backpack, convey a casual, natural vibe similar to a smartphone capture without any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scene in Image B is set on a desk and includes a stylized bear and a backpack. The lighting and composition do reflect a casual environment, as seen in typical smartphone captures, without overt digital artifacts. This maintains a natural vibe despite the stylized elements of the bear.",
