    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar proportionally sized and positioned in a way that maintains the original rectangular shape of the bars without distorting their geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal bars have been anthropomorphized by adding facial features and hands. These additions seem proportionate and do not significantly alter the rectangular shape of the bars. The features are aligned in such a way that maintains the integrity of the cereal bars' original geometry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cereal bar characters appear to interact with the pink flamingo mug in a physically plausible manner, such as touching or leaning toward it, without violating spatial logic or causing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal bar characters are oriented towards the flamingo mug, but there is no direct physical interaction, like touching or leaning. The placement maintains spatial logic without any obvious inconsistencies, as the characters are on the table surface with no overlap or implausible positioning against the mug.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the whimsical font placed above the cereal bar characters clearly legible, properly aligned, and free from artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font in Image B is colorful, clearly legible, and well-aligned above the cereal bar characters. The lettering is smooth and free of artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring, suggesting a clean integration into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added facial features and hands on the cereal bars preserve the original texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, without introducing unnatural smoothness, sharp edges, or missing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the cereal bars have added facial features and hands, they have been designed in a cartoonish style. This style naturally includes some level of abstraction from the original textures. However, the underlying cereal and chocolate textures are still discernible, suggesting a preservation of detail although in a stylized fashion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tiny hands added to the cereal bars have a natural number of fingers (no more than five), proper curvature, and appropriate shadowing to match the lighting in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands on the cereal bars in Image B are cartoon-like and each has a number of fingers consistent with the simplified character style, appearing to have four. They are curved properly and the shadowing is consistent with the overall lighting of the scene, maintaining a coherent appearance.",
