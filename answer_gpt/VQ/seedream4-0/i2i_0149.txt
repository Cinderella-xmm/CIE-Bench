    "Question": "Q1: Does the cat's head extend naturally out of the frame without any visible artifacts or unrealistic stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's head is positioned in a way that it does not appear to unnaturally extend out of any frame. It maintains a coherent and realistic form, with no visible artifacts or indications of stretching. The shape of the ears and alignment of the facial features look natural, which suggests that any form of editing has not disrupted the head's realistic anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the curled tongue depicted with natural texture and spatial depth, enhancing the illusion of it peeking out from the frame?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's curled tongue appears to have a natural texture and shape, consistent with how a cat's tongue would realistically look. The tongue's shadowing and the way it interacts with the lighting in the image contribute to a believable spatial depth, making it seem as though it protrudes naturally from the cat’s mouth.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the lighting and shadow on the cat's extended head and curled tongue consistent with the rest of the image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on the cat’s head and tongue are consistent with the overall lighting of the scene. The sunlight appears to be hitting the cat from a similar angle, with shadows falling naturally consistent with the rest of the image. This lighting coherence helps in creating a seamless and natural appearance.",
