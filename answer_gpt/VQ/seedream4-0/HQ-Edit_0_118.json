      "question": "Are the edges and transitions of the womanâ€™s clothing, hair, and facial features smooth and consistent with watercolor rendering, without jagged lines or unnatural texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the woman's clothing and hair are smooth, characteristic of watercolor paintings which typically have soft transitions and blended colors. There are no visible jagged lines or texture breaks that would make the rendering appear unnatural for a watercolor style. The soft, fluid lines are consistent throughout the clothing and hair, reflecting a cohesive watercolor technique.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elongated drape sections of the robe follow natural gravitational flow and maintain consistent fabric thickness and fold patterns without appearing stretched or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drape sections of the robe follow a natural gravitational flow, hanging naturally as they would with real fabric. The fabric maintains consistent thickness and fold patterns, which align with the characteristics of a robe's material, demonstrating an understanding of how fabric behaves under gravitational influence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the botanical patterns on the robe evenly distributed, aligned with the fabric weave, and blended naturally with the surrounding colors without visible seams or repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows botanical patterns that are evenly distributed across the robe, integrated into the fabric without visible seams or repetition artifacts. The patterns are aligned with the weave of the fabric, suggesting a natural blending with the surrounding colors, creating a cohesive and harmonious appearance typical of watercolor designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the leaf outlines within the book pages clearly defined, proportionally scaled to the page size, and integrated without distorting the book's spine, edges, or page curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf outlines on the book pages are clearly defined and scaled appropriately to the page size. They integrate well with the page without causing distortions to the book's spine, edges, or curvature, which is important for maintaining the realistic portrayal within the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the added sun rays originate from a logical direction relative to the tree canopy and cast soft glows and subtle shadows that match the depth and density of the surrounding foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun rays originate from the upper right corner, a logical direction given the tree canopy's position. These rays cast soft glows and subtle shadows that blend well with the depth and density of the surrounding foliage, enhancing the natural ambiance and illustrating coherent lighting effects typical of watercolor art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the border positioned uniformly around the image edge, containing subtle literary symbols (e.g., books, quills), and does it not obscure or distort any part of the main subject or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border in Image B is uniformly positioned around the edge, decorated with literary symbols such as books and quills. This border complements the main subject and background without obscuring or distorting them, offering an additional thematic layer to the image while maintaining visual balance.",
