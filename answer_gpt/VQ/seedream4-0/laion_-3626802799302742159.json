    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) and limbs added to the cookies smooth, proportionally consistent with the cookie size, and free from pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and limbs added to the cookies appear well-integrated with the cookie surfaces. The features such as eyes and mouths are smooth and of a size that fits the cookies' circular faces. The limbs are similarly proportionate to the cookies, and there are no visible pixelation or jagged edges, suggesting a clean addition to the image. This gives them a cartoon-like appearance, consistent with their playful design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the transformed plate appear continuous, evenly distributed, and consistent with fabric texture, without visible seams or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the floral pattern is now placed on what looks to be a picnic-like setting beneath the cup and cookies, resembling a fabric rather than the solid plate from Image A. The pattern seems evenly distributed across the surface with a consistent texture that suggests fabric, like a tablecloth, with no obvious seams or areas where the design becomes distorted or stretched. This suggests a seamless integration of the floral pattern onto a fabric object.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the added miniature chairs and tea table positioned within the cup and around it in a way that respects physical proportions and does not cause overlapping or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature chairs and tea table are strategically placed around the cup and cookies. The items seem to be positioned respecting the proportions of the scene, with the furniture placed apart as if to accommodate the imaginary setting. Everything is on a flat fabric surface, maintaining contact with the ground, and no elements appear to be overlapping unnaturally or floating unrealistically.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions on the cookies (grinning, pouting, winking) show clear differentiation in mouth and eye shapes while maintaining symmetry and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies show distinct facial expressions. The grinning cookie has a wide smile with crescent eyes, the pouting one has a downward arc for a mouth and narrowed eyes, and the winking one has one eye curved upward in a closed wink. These expressions are well-differentiated, maintaining symmetry and natural curvature, illustrating a range of emotions clearly and effectively while fitting well within the cookie's round face.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the positions of the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table arranged in a way that suggests stable contact with surfaces and realistic depth, without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookie characters are placed directly on the tablecloth-like fabric, with their limbs positioned as if they are resting firmly on the surface. The miniature chairs and tea table are also resting solidly on the ground indicating stable contact with the surface beneath them. There are no signs of floating or unrealistically placed objects, suggesting that the elements have been arranged to display realistic interaction with their surface and depth in the scene.",
