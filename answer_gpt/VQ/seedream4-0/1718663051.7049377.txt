    "Question": "Q1: Are the branches of the tree composed of clean, angular geometric lines consistent with Art Deco style, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branches are represented by a pattern of geometric shapes that resemble stained glass, typical in Art Deco designs. The angular lines and structured appearance suggest deliberate design, consistent with Art Deco specifications, free from jagged edges or abrupt structural interruptions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the grass in the foreground display muted, uniform coloration with preserved textural details such as individual blades or soft gradients, rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially colored?",
    "explanation": "The grass in Image B retains a stained glass style with defined color segments, giving it texture without flatness. While blades are rendered through colored sections rather than individually detailed, the effect and the limited color palette provide a sense of depth and texture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the mountain silhouettes composed of defined angular planes in bronze and teal tones, maintaining layered depth and spatial consistency without overlapping or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are constructed with angular planes in distinct bronze and teal colors typical of stained glass artwork. The structured shapes maintain a sense of layered depth while spatial consistency is ensured by cohesive transitions between color blocks. There are no overlapping or visually misplaced segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the sky feature a smooth gradient from dark at the top to lighter near the horizon, with thin, evenly spaced accent lines that follow the curvature of the scene without intersecting or distorting the starfield?",
    "explanation": "Image B lacks a surrounding starfield and focuses instead on its geometric stained glass design. The accents are defined by borders and shapes inherent to the stained glass style, with light and color transitions effectively mimicking a sky gradient in the stained glass context rather than a continuous color shift.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all elements—tree, mountains, and sky—rendered with consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills, lacking transparent patches, misaligned edges, or inconsistent shading within the same layer?",
    "explanation": "All elements in Image B, including the tree, mountains, and the representation of the sky, are uniformly designed in stained glass style. The use of distinct outlines separates individual segments without mismatched edges or transparency issues, maintaining consistent shading patterns across all layers, typical of stained glass work.",
    "answer": "Yes"
