    "Question": "Q1: Are the wood grain patterns across the surface of the boot evenly distributed and consistent with natural wood textures, avoiding artificial or repetitive patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boot has been crafted to resemble a wooden sculpture, showcasing patterns that mimic the natural flow and irregularity of actual wood grain. Each section presents a unique set of lines and contours, consistent with genuine wood textures and avoiding any artificial repetition. These patterns follow the natural lines of the boot's design, providing a cohesive and realistic wooden texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the transitions between light and dark wood tones on the boot follow the same contour and depth as the original leather and rubber sections, ensuring no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color?",
    "explanation": "Image B features the boot crafted from wood, displaying subtle transitions between various wood tones. These tonal shifts mirror the original boot's contour and depth, allowing for a smooth gradient across curves and structural features. This avoids abrupt color changes and instead provides a realistic simulation of how light and shadow interact with a wooden surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas shaped precisely like the original metal hardware and fabric loops, without deformation or missing structural elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boot's wooden design carefully replicates the original features, including reinforcement areas and lacing holes. These elements are ingeniously carved to reflect the metal hardware and fabric loops' form, maintaining their precise shape and spatial arrangement without deformation or loss of structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the wooden shelf flat, stable, and properly aligned beneath the boot, with no visible warping, floating, or unsupported edges that break physical logic?",
    "explanation": "The wooden shelf in Image B is depicted as stable, flat, and well-aligned underneath the boot. Its edges are consistently supported, avoiding any signs of warping or unrealistic floating that would compromise its ability to bear the weight of the boot. This creates a coherent and physically logical appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the boot retain its original three-dimensional shape, including toe box, heel, and ankle support, without any stretching, flattening, or irregular bulges?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the boot as a wooden sculpture that preserves all original contours and supports. The toe box, heel, and ankle regions maintain their defined three-dimensional shapes without evidence of stretching or flattening. The wood is crafted to mimic the boot's original form, ensuring no irregular bulges or distortions appear.",
    "answer": "Yes"
