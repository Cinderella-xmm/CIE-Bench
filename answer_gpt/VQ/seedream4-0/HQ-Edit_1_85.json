    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the lace details on the blouse rendered with consistent texture and edge definition, avoiding jagged or artificial-looking patterns that break from realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blouse is depicted with intricate lace details that are constructed through a layered paper effect. This maintains a sense of consistent texture and edge definition, which mimics realistic fabric behavior. Although the medium is stylized, it avoids jagged or artificial-looking patterns that could break immersion, making the lace appear well-integrated and coherent within the art style. The lace is cleanly defined, as expected in a paper illustration style.",

      "question": "Does the enlarged violin maintain correct proportions and undistorted structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, without visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the violin through a paper art depiction, ensuring that the structural elements, including the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, are precisely crafted. While the visual interpretation is stylized, it adheres closely to the correct proportions and undistorted presentation typical of an actual violin. There is no visible warping or stretching of these features, demonstrating a faithful representation within the constraints of the medium.",

      "question": "Are the fingers on both hands correctly positioned and shaped, with no extra digits or distorted joints, maintaining natural human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers are illustrated with attention to correct positioning and shaping according to human anatomy. They are crafted within a paper-cut art style, which ensures that the hands appear anatomically plausible without extra digits or distorted joints. The natural positioning of the fingers on the violin seems well-considered and accurately reflects realistic playing technique.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall surface texture consistent across the image, with no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains uniform surface texture and consistent lighting typical of paper art. The entirety of the image is crafted in a manner that aligns with this style, avoiding mismatched areas or sudden changes that would indicate poor layer blending. The gloss and material quality are uniform, ensuring harmonious integration across different elements within the visual scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all foreground elements (girl, violin, table, candlestick) maintain consistent depth and placement, avoiding floating or misplaced components that disrupt spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All foreground elements in Image B – including the girl, violin, table, and candlestick – are artistically rendered to maintain spatial consistency in depth and placement. Although the art style is paper-based, it effectively leverages layered elements and shadowing to prevent any components from appearing to float or be spatially misplaced, upholding the spatial logic of the scene.",
