      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel curls should seamlessly integrate with the hairline to maintain a natural head shape and smooth scalp surface. The cogwheels should appear as though they belong to the structure of the sculpture, without creating irregularities or gaps that disrupt the natural flow of the hair. Observing the image, the cogwheels meld well with the hair, without causing any visual anomalies in the head's shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic fabric is meant to hug the contours of the sculpture's shoulders and chest similar to how cloth would naturally fall and gather. Additionally, the placement of rivets and tubes needs to make sense structurally, complementing the sculpture without conflicting with its shape or gravitational expectations. The edited image shows the metallic folds adhering well to the body, with rivets and tubes placed logically.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gears and watch parts on the base of Image B need to be arranged symmetrically and stably. This requires each component to be positioned in a manner that respects physical balance and reality, maintaining stability without any floating or overlapping that defies gravitational laws. The arrangement of the gears and watch parts appears stable and well-balanced in their positions on the base.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monocle should fit snugly within the eye socket, attached through realistic mechanical joints that connect the monocle to the sculpture’s face without distorting facial anatomy. Although the face itself isn't visible, the monocle mechanism in Image B appears to be designed to maintain fidelity to the original form while allowing for mechanical additions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coloration of Image B involves implementing bronze and copper tones consistently across all enhanced features—particularly metallic surfaces. Uniform application involves consistent reflection properties and a seamless transition of colors, indicating a realistic metallic texture. In the image, the tones appear uniformly applied, with appropriate reflections that translate to a metallic look.",
