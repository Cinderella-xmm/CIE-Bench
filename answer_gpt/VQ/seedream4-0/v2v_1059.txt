    "Question": "Q1: Do the zebras maintain their signature striped coats with no unnatural texture or loss of detail in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are recreated in a chibi-style 3D form, which involves exaggerating certain features to achieve a cute aesthetic. The textures are simplified, and the stripes on the zebras are smooth and stylized rather than having the textured, detailed appearance we see on a real zebra. Therefore, the striped coats do not maintain the natural texture and detail found in real-life zebras.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the lush green field and fencing preserved in a photorealistic manner without any visible distortion or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background of the field and the fencing appear unchanged and photorealistic, similar to what one would expect from an untouched photograph. There is no noticeable distortion or visible artifacts, reflecting the consistency with realistic environmental features.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the zebras retain their realistic grazing stances without any distortion or deformation in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
    "explanation": "The zebras in Image B are presented in a chibi style, meaning their bodies are stylized and simplified, which is part of this art style's characteristic. While they do mimic the general stance of grazing (lowered heads), their bodies are not in realistic proportions or form, hence there is a deviation from realistic grazed stances.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the ornate decorative photo frame integrate seamlessly with the scene without disrupting the visual coherence or introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The addition of the ornate decorative photo frame in Image B creates a distinct boundary around the scene while introducing an element that typically doesn't exist within a photograph setting. Despite this, it visually integrates well with the scene without any clear distortions or artifacts affecting the coherence of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the photorealistic background smooth and believable without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D zebras in Image B contrast with the photorealistic background due to their stylized design, which makes the transition less smooth and believable if compared to the realistic zebras in Image A. The difference in art styles creates a noticeable inconsistency, impacting the seamlessness of their integration.",
    "answer": "No"
