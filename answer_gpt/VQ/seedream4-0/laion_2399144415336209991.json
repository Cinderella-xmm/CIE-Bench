      "question": "Are the enhanced beads on the bride's shoulder straps evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the fabric's surface without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the bride's shoulder straps are rendered in a cartoon style. Upon examining the shoulder straps, the beads appear evenly spaced and are smoothly integrated into the fabric's surface. They do not appear detached or sharp, fitting the overall cartoon aesthetic. World knowledge about cartoon illustration suggests that these elements should be simplified but coherent within the design.",
