      "question": "Is the golden halo around the blacksmith’s head smoothly rendered with even luminosity and no jagged edges or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The halo surrounding the blacksmith’s head in Image B is depicted as a circular shape with a radiant glow. In art, halos are often used to symbolize divinity or sanctity and are depicted as smooth, luminous circles. By observing the image, the halo appears evenly lit without any noticeable irregularities or seams along its edge. The smoothness and consistent lighting suggest that the halo is well-rendered.",

      "question": "Do the flowing robes on the central figure show natural fabric folds and consistent material texture without unnatural stretching or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robes of the central figure in Image B are shown with voluminous folds and a flowing texture. In historical and artistic depictions, robes are often rendered to exhibit realistic fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body and movement. The robes in Image B show consistent material texture and natural-looking folds, without signs of stretching or gaps, which suggests an attention to detail and realistic fabric depiction.",

      "question": "Are the divine instruments held by the blacksmith clearly derived from the original hammer and tongs, with preserved proportions and no geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blacksmith holds a hammer and tongs, used in metalworking. These tools are visually derived directly from their counterparts in Image A, retaining the same form and proportions. Art often maintains consistency in proportions when transforming objects into symbolic or divine representations to preserve their recognizability. The tools show no geometric distortions and maintain their functional shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing interior of the forge emit consistent radiant light without excessive bloom, pixelation, or irregular ember patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forge's interior in Image B radiates light from the fire, which is critical in depicting ambient warmth and illumination in scenes involving blacksmiths. The glow shows consistent light distribution across the area, giving the impression of a natural fire. There is neither excessive bloom nor pixelation affecting the quality of light, and the ember patterns are regular, contributing to a realistic depiction of the forge.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vine borders and calligraphy evenly distributed along the image edges without overlapping or obscuring the main subject or tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, decorative vine motifs and calligraphy adorn the borders. Typically, borders are used to frame artwork without encroaching upon the central subject. The vines and letters are positioned along the edges, complementing the scene without intersecting or blocking the main visual elements of the blacksmith and his tools, ensuring a coherent and unobstructed composition.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands of the blacksmith display anatomically correct five-fingered grips with natural joint alignment and no deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Anatomical correctness in portrayals of the human form is crucial for realism and believability. In Image B, the blacksmith’s hands are gripping the tools key to his craft. They are depicted with the correct number of fingers (five) and appear to be naturally positioned with appropriate joint alignment, demonstrating that the anatomy was accurately rendered without deformities, ensuring natural interaction with the tools.",
