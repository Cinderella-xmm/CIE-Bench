      "question": "Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D cartoon style in Image B uses smooth curves and consistent shapes, giving the thermometer a uniform appearance. The design retains its intended function and clarity without any unexpected artifacts or shape distortions, suggesting a well-maintained structural consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soft lighting reflections and highlights on the thermometer's metallic surface enhance its three-dimensional appearance. The smooth gradients and subtle sheen are consistent with how light interacts with rounded metallic objects, suggesting a natural and intentional finish without any loss of detail or introduction of unnaturally rough textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10Â°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stats in Image B are placed at the bottom on a nameplate that aligns with the overall design theme. The text is clear and well-integrated, enhancing informational value without overwhelming the visual space or leading to distortion. This seamless integration maintains readability and aesthetic coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner at the top and the nameplate at the bottom are strategically positioned to frame the central thermometer without encroaching on the functional or visual core areas. They are clearly visible and add to the thematic verisimilitude and ordered layout, thus contributing positively to the image's visual credibility.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cool-toned background and clean, sharp borders contrast with the warmer tones and outlines of the thermometer. This provides a professional and technologically oriented aesthetic that enhances the instrument's functional portrayal while maintaining an artifact-free, coherent image.",
