    "Question": "Q1: Do the metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet reflect light consistently with the scene’s illumination and maintain accurate surface contours without warping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist's outfit and helmet have been edited to have a metallic texture. The reflection of light on these metallic surfaces is consistent with the natural lighting of the scene, as the brighter areas are where the light source hits directly, and the shadows follow the contours accurately. This consistency suggests careful attention to lighting direction and surface contours, maintaining realistic reflections and textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car smooth, evenly lit, and free from jagged edges or overlapping with real-world details like tires or license plates?",
    "explanation": "The neon glow lines in Image B are edited along the road edges, cyclist, and car. They appear smooth and evenly lit, without visible jagged edges. The glow does not overlap with significant real-world details like tires or license plates, indicating a precise application of visual effects that enhances the futuristic theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet aligned with the helmet’s curvature, showing clear digital content without ghosting, blurring, or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The visor display in Image B is shown as being transparent and aligned with the helmet's curvature. The digital content displayed is clear and sharp, with no visible signs of ghosting, blurring, or distortion, which suggests that the visual effect has been carefully integrated to match the contours of the helmet.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the holographic cycling stats near the escort car spatially coherent, appropriately sized relative to the car, and displayed with soft edges and ambient glow without casting incorrect shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic stats displayed near the escort car are spatially coherent, with dimensions that respect the size of the car and the scene. The stats have soft edges and an ambient glow, contributing to the futuristic effect without casting any incorrect shadows, ensuring visual harmony within the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements—including metallic finishes, neon glows, digital visor display, and holographic projections—coexist without visual contradictions such as mismatched lighting, texture clashes, or distorted shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all edited elements harmonize without visual contradictions. The metallic finishes reflect light appropriately, neon glows are smoothly integrated, visor displays are clear and follow the helmet's shape, and holographic projections have coherent lighting and sizing. There are no clashes in textures or lighting mismatches, indicating a cohesive and consistent visual integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
