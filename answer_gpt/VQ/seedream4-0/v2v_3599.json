      "question": "Do the armored medieval knights maintain the same size proportions relative to the crib and wall as the original stuffed animals did?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored medieval knights are compared to the crib and wall. Typically, we recognize stuffed animals as smaller objects, especially in the context of a crib. Examining the knights in Image B, their size proportions relative to the crib and wall appear larger than typical stuffed animals, indicating that they do not maintain the same size proportions as the original toys in Image A.",

      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or color gradients where the knights' armor meets the floor or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, to determine if there are unnatural textures or color gradients, one should examine the area where the armored knights meet the floor and wall. The textures and colors should blend naturally without abrupt or artificial-looking shifts. Analyzing this area, no significant unnatural textures or gradients are present that disrupt the visual continuity of the image.",

      "question": "Do the armored medieval knights cast realistic shadows consistent with the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow direction need to be consistent with the overall room lighting. Observing the shadows cast by the knights, they fall naturally and align with the light source, which appears to be coming from a similar direction as in Image A. The shadows are coherent with the scene's lighting, giving a realistic impression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the knights positioned in a way that appears natural and plausible, as if they were sitting against the wall like the stuffed animals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positioning of the knights is examined for a natural appearance. They are shown seated against the wall, with relaxed arm and leg positions that resemble how toys or small figures might be posed. Despite their larger size, their sitting posture mimics a relaxed stance similar to the original stuffed animals, making it appear plausible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the armor of the knights exhibit fine details and a level of detail that matches the rest of the image's clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight armor is inspected for detail consistency with the overall image clarity. The armor features distinct textures and reflective surfaces, suggesting a high level of detail. This detail is consistent with the rest of the image, which is in sharp focus, making it match comprehensively.",
