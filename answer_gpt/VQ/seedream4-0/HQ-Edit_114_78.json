      "question": "Does the key maintain its original geometric shape and proportions when transformed into a bridge, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key is used as a bridge, but when examining its visual cues, the key does appear to have some transformations. The part of the key used as the bridge is modified to integrate into the scene artistically. The original geometric shapes and proportions in Image A show a regular antique key without alterations, while in Image B, the key undergoes changes in its function and context as a bridge. Given the creative changes evident in the scene in Image B, there is some warping or stretching to allow for seamless integration into the landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny houses and trees positioned in a way that aligns with the wood grain’s depth and surface plane, without floating or appearing disconnected from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny houses and trees are placed on a carved wooden hill which is resting in a small case. The positioning of these elements is consistent with a miniature diorama setup where the houses and trees are solidly planted on the hill surface. They do not appear to be floating or disconnected, especially as they adhere to the visual space created by the carved wooden hill surface, showcasing effective alignment with the intended background depth and plane.",

      "question": "Does the resin river emerge smoothly from the key’s bit and flow with consistent material properties, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the resin river flowing from the bit of the key smoothly, mimicking water in a consistent manner. The river is depicted with a natural water-like texture, displaying uniformity in color and material properties along its path within the diorama. There are no evident breaks or color shifts that disrupt this representation, maintaining the consistency of the river's appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boundary of the key case clearly defined and consistent with the wood grain and metallic tones of the key, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the key case displays a consistency in texture, highlighting metallic elements aligned with the key itself. The lighting and the visually defined boundary across the wooden base complement the metallic tones, showing adequate integration. Looking at the boundary and lighting, there are no sudden shifts disrupting the design coherence. The continuity between the textures and lighting confirms an even transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carved wooden hill seamlessly blended into the surrounding wood grain, with consistent texture and shading that suggests natural carving rather than digital patching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carved wooden hill shows detailed craftsmanship suggestive of natural carving. The textures and shading adhere to realistic gradients and contours typical of carved wood. The way it integrates with its immediate surroundings, including the wood grain, supports a seamless blending rather than appearing as an artificial digital insertion. The overall appearance is convincingly integrated within the environment of the diorama.",
