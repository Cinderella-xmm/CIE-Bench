    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed house maintain consistent geometric shapes without jagged edges, overlapping planes, or unnatural fragmentation that disrupts structural integrity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the house is depicted using various geometric shapes in vibrant colors. The transformation involves converting the original architecture into a mosaic-like pattern. The geometric shapes seem to fit together cohesively without any visible jagged edges or overlaps, suggesting that the structural integrity of the shapes is maintained. The visual representation shows organized sections that align in a manner consistent with a stylized, modern aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the abstract representations of the crowd evenly distributed across their original positions without clustering or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd is represented in a simplistic and abstract style with differently colored figures. These figures are distributed along the path where the crowd is expected to be, similar to Image A's positions. There are no visible clusters or floating figures that suggest a violation of spatial logic, and they appear evenly spread across the scene, just as one would imagine a crowd standing to view a golf course event.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the checkered pattern applied uniformly across the entire grass surface without visible seams, inconsistent spacing, or distortion at edges near sand traps and water?",
    "explanation": "The checkered pattern in Image B is applied broadly across the grass area. It remains uniform in appearance with consistent spacing between the squares. In areas adjacent to sand traps and water, the pattern maintains its form without noticeable distortion or deviation in alignment from the main pattern area, suggesting an even and deliberate application true to real space representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Do the prismatic shards in the water reflect the house and sky in fragmented but coherent angular segments without ghosting, blurring, or unnatural color separation?",
    "explanation": "The reflection of the house and sky in Image B is rendered as a series of colorful prismatic shards. These shards create a fragmented appearance consistent with the edited style but remain coherent in reflecting the edited image elements. The shards show no ghosting or blurring, and the color separation is consistent with the abstract style intended, maintaining visual coherence without unnatural elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the vibrant geometric planes on the houseâ€™s facade consistently lit and shaded to match the ambient light direction, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadow mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the house features geometric planes with different vibrant colors. The lighting and shading within these planes seem to match the ambient light coming from the right side of the image, as indicated by the light and shadow fall on the structure. The highlights and shadows appear coherent with the light source observed in the rest of the scene, ensuring that there are no mismatches or unnatural highlights, supporting the overall integrity of the abstract design as integrated into the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
