    "Question": "Q1: Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the moss textures are applied along the tusks of the warthog. By observing the curvature of the tusks, the moss seems to adhere closely to these curved surfaces, implying a natural growth pattern consistent with how moss might attach in reality. The shadows cast by the moss appear to be consistent with the lighting direction in the image, which suggests that there's a thoughtful blend of texture placement and shadowing.",
