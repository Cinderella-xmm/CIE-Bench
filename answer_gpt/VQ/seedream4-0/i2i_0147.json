      "question": "Does the melted cheese appear with a natural texture and color, without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the melted cheese is visually identifiable by its yellow-orange color and slightly glossy texture, which is consistent with how melted cheese typically looks. The positioning on the sausage also appears appropriate, adhering naturally to the surface without any odd protrusions or visible artifacts that would suggest manipulation. The color fits well within the expected hue for melted cheese under warm lighting, like that from a grill, thus appearing natural.",

      "question": "Are the fried onions positioned naturally on the hot dog, avoiding any distortion or breakage of geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the fried onions retain a natural look, curved and layered in a way that is consistent with how they would rest on a hot dog. Their shapes appear intact without noticeable distortion or unnatural alterations. They seem to be randomly placed in a way that looks believable for a casual application, following the contours of the sausage.",

      "question": "Do the melted cheese and fried onions blend seamlessly with the hot dog buns and sausages, preserving structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The melted cheese and fried onions in Image B are integrated into the hot dog composition in a realistic manner. The cheese wraps smoothly over the sausage, and the onions are nestled on top without odd gaps or misalignments. This suggests a seamless interaction between these elements and the hot dog, maintaining the visual coherence and expected structural consistency of a dressed-up hot dog.",

      "question": "Are the details of the melted cheese and fried onions preserved without losing clarity or introducing blurry textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the melted cheese and fried onions without any apparent loss of detail or blurriness. The cheese has clear edges and a discernible texture, and the onions display visible rings and a crispy appearance typical of fried onions. This level of detail indicates that the texture of these toppings is well-preserved without degradation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the barbecue tong look naturally placed near the grill, maintaining its structural integrity and proportion with the rest of the image elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barbecue tong is shown gripping one of the hot dogs, and it appears to be correctly scaled and proportioned relative to the hot dog and grill. The orientation and position of the tong are natural, as it holds the hot dog in a realistic manner that reflects how a tong would be used in practice, without any structural distortion.",
