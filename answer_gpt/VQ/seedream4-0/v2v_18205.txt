    "Question": "Q1: Does the horse's musculature display intricate detail and natural texture without any unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's musculature is depicted in fine detail, with realistic rendering for a lifelike appearance.

    "Question": "Q2: Are the lighting effects on the horse and elephant consistent with a Renaissance-inspired style and do they enhance the anatomical features naturally?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses dramatic lighting to cast realistic shadows, enhancing the depth and three-dimensionality of the horse and elephant. This style is reminiscent of the chiaroscuro technique in Renaissance art, which uses contrasts between light and dark to give figures a more solid, realistic look. The lighting enhances the anatomical features without appearing forced or unnatural, giving the sculpture a dramatic yet elegant appearance.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the proportions and physical structure of the horse and elephant appear rational and consistent with their anatomical forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the horse and elephant appear to be consistent with their natural anatomical forms. The horse is depicted with robust and strong proportionate legs and body, and the elephant displays massive dimensions that fit its stature. Both animals maintain their respective characteristic forms, creating a rational depiction aligned with their known anatomies.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the composition of the horse standing on a platform above the elephant visually credible and structurally coherent?",
    "explanation": "The composition in Image B shows a horse standing on a platform above the elephant, an unconventional but creatively suggestive scene. The image successfully distributes balance and scale to make such stacking visually credible. The depiction of a solid platform gives the scene a coherent structural semblance, making this unique scenario believable within the artistic context.",
