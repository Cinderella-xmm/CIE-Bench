      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the calendar pages clear and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten notes like 'Birthday,' 'Wedding,' and the dates circled in various colors are clearly visible and legible. The handwriting and highlighted circles are distinct and do not show any signs of distortion or blurriness. This observation indicates that the notes and highlights are presented clearly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the textures of the paper and desk appear natural and consistent with the lighting and shadows in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the paper has a more matte and textured look compared to Image A, possibly suggesting a more vintage or worn-out appearance. The desk appears wooden and the shadows and lighting cast on it are consistent, suggesting a natural light source from the top left. These details make the textures appear cohesive and realistic within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged neatly without any unnatural breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays calendar pages that are overlapped in a slightly haphazard manner. While they are not perfectly aligned, this arrangement suggests a natural, informal spread of pages, which doesn't disrupt the overall coherence of the scene. No unnatural breaks or obvious misalignments are visible that would draw attention to poor editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text and grid lines on the calendar pages sharp and well-defined without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text and grid lines maintain clarity and sharpness, evident in the distinct separation of numbers, letters, and lines. There is no noticeable fuzziness or loss of detail in these elements which suggests that they are well-preserved in terms of resolution and definition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the handwritten notes and highlights consistent and natural, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors of the handwritten notes and highlights in Image B, such as red, blue, green, yellow, and purple, appear consistent in their appearance and saturation levels. There are no jarring or distracting color variations that would detract from a natural look, maintaining consistency with the original intent of marking key dates.",
