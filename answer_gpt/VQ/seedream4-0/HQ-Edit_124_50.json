      "question": "Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The puzzle sections on the horse's body are visible with defined edges. However, these edges do not follow the natural curves of the horse's form perfectly, creating uneven interlocks and slight misalignments. The logic of clean interlocking would require smoother transitions and exact fitting along the natural curves, which are lacking in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the puzzle pieces in Image B show misalignment at the edges where the pieces meet. The world knowledge about puzzles suggests that seamless alignment should show no visual interruptions, but here, the misaligned floral patterns disrupt the continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears clear with no visible distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections. As is common with high-quality glass domes, the transparency and clarity suggest realistic simulation of a proper material.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base shows realistic grain and texture that imitates the appearance of natural wood. The embedded compass aligns well with the surface plane and scale of the base, ensuring visual coherence as expected in craftsmanship.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antique-brass accents in Image B are placed logically on the frame and base and display a matte-to-slight reflective finish as would be expected from aged metal. This positioning and finish are consistent with what is seen in typical decorative brass items.",
