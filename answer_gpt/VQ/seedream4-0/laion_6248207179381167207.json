      "question": "Are the silver and turquoise geometric patterns evenly distributed across the handbag's surface without visible misalignment, stretching, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag displays a series of geometric patterns that feature silver and turquoise elements. Upon examination, these patterns appear evenly distributed across the surface of the handbag, without signs of misalignment, stretching, or pixelation. The patterns follow a structured and symmetrical layout, aligning well with the handbag's edges and contours. The clarity and precision of these patterns suggest that they have been edited properly onto the surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic accents on the leather straps appear seamlessly integrated, with no sharp edges, inconsistent shading, or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the metallic accents on the leather straps show a consistent integration with the overall design of the bag. There are no sharp edges or inconsistencies in shading that would disrupt the seamless appearance of these metallic elements. The highlights on the metallic parts are evenly distributed and correspond with the texture of the straps, indicating careful editing.",

      "question": "Are the machine-age engravings along the edges of the handbag continuous, properly aligned with the contours, and free from broken lines or overlapping patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the handbag are adorned with machine-age engravings. These engravings are continuous and maintain alignment with the contours and edges of the handbag’s surface. There are no broken lines or visible overlapping patterns, which suggest a meticulous and consistent editing process. The engravings enhance the aesthetic without errors.",

      "question": "Are the front pockets and zippered closure still clearly defined and structurally coherent, with no distortion in their shape or placement relative to each other?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the front pockets and zippered closure maintain their structural integrity and are well-defined. Their placements relative to each other show no signs of distortion or misalignment. The edited geometric patterns and engravings coexist with the handbag’s form without impacting its original shape or functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the transformed surfaces exhibit realistic material properties, such as subtle texture variation and appropriate light reflection, without appearing flat or digitally over-rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handbag surfaces appear transformed with realistic material properties. The silver and turquoise transformations exhibit subtle texture variation and realistic light reflection, preventing them from looking flat or overly digital. The light interacts with the metallic finish appropriately, showcasing the material's intended effect and quality in the design.",
