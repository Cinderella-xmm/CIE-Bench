      "question": "Does the bold black outline fully trace the crocodile's form without breaking or misaligning at joints, scales, or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized version of a crocodile with bold black outlines. The outlines trace the shape and features of the crocodile through its scales, facial features, and limbs. Throughout Image B, these outlines maintain consistency without any obvious breaks or misalignments, emphasizing a cohesive depiction according to the chosen artistic approach.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the hat and sunglasses vividly saturated but still preserving visible texture details like knit stitches and lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and sunglasses feature bright, vivid colors complying with the stylized, cartoonish theme of the image. However, this stylization minimizes visible texture details such as the knit stitches on the hat and lens reflections on the sunglasses. The focus is more on bold color use than on fine texture details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin repeat consistently across the neck, back, and limbs without gaps, overlaps, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized design in Image B incorporates consistent geometric patterns largely across the skin, including the neck, back, and limbs of the crocodile. These patterns repeat systematically without apparent gaps, overlaps, or distortion, creating a uniform artistic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns aligned correctly with the crocodile’s head and body, showing no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and sunglasses are positioned correctly on the crocodile's head, aligning well without floating or appearing out of place. The geometric patterns also match the contours of the body accurately, maintaining a coherent alignment with the crocodile’s form.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the crocodile's facial features within a stylized dimension, but vital anatomical elements such as the snout, teeth, and eye placement remain proportionally accurate with regard to the artistic depiction. The attributes maintain a recognizable structure, ensuring that despite the artistic rendition, distortion does not detract from the identification of the crocodile.",
