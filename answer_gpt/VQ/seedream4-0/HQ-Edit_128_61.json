      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed tagine retain its original conical shape and base proportions, with no visible warping or deformation in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original tagine has been transformed into a genie lamp. The lamp replaces the conical shape of the tagine with a more rounded, elongated form typical of fictional genie lamps from folklore. By only observing Image B, the conical shape and base proportions of the tagine are not retained as the object's structure has significantly changed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arabesque patterns and gem-like details on the tagine's surface evenly rendered with consistent texture, lighting response, and material properties, without any visible seams or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object features arabesque patterns and gem-like details that appear consistent with what one would expect on a decorated lamp. The texture and material properties seem to respond well to the lighting without visible seams or unnatural highlights, which suggests a well-rendered surface mimicking intricate craftsmanship.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the smoke emerging from the tagine smooth, translucent, and flowing naturally, with a clearly defined but soft-edged genie silhouette that does not exhibit jagged lines or digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke emerges smoothly and creates a translucent genie silhouette. The edges of the genie appear soft and defined, capturing a natural flow without the presence of jagged lines or digital distortion, achieving a seamless mystical appearance typical of smoke-based depictions of genies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic threads and jewel-like elements on the fabric appear embedded within the textile weave, with realistic reflection and shadowing that matches the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric beneath the genie lamp has jeweled and metallic elements that seem well-integrated within the textile, showing realistic embedding. The reflections and shadows these elements cast are consistent with the surrounding fabric material, which gives them a natural appearance on the textile surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the tagine and the smoke consistent with the light source direction, and do they properly interact with the fabric and surrounding environment without floating or misplaced areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the genie lamp and the smoke follow the direction indicated by the lighting. These shadows interact naturally with the fabric, aligning with the object's placement and light source without appearing to float or misalign with the environmental context, ensuring realistic shading and interaction.",
