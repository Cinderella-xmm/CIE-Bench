    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bell jar surrounds the robot effectively, showcasing clear and smooth surfaces. The reflections and refractions seen through the glass do not distort the shape or structure of the robot inside. Common glass properties include transparency and the ability to reflect and refract light naturally, which is accurately depicted in this image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the pedestal under the robot properly aligned, proportionally sized, and made of materials consistent with the steampunk theme (e.g., brass, copper) without visible seams or deformation?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a pedestal under the robot made of materials often seen in steampunk aesthetics, such as copper or brass, which have a rustic and industrial look. The pedestal is well-aligned and proportionately sized, keeping the robot at a central position under the glass jar, without visible seams or deformities, consistent with typical construction of such themed objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils positioned at a plausible scale and orientation around the robot, with natural textures and no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils surrounding the robot are positioned realistically within the glass jar. They display plausible scaling and orientation, consistent with the proportions needed to be viewed as accessories or components. The textures are detailed, adhering to natural metallic characteristics, with no parts inexplicably floating or appearing disconnected.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the glowing orbs emit a soft, localized glow that blends naturally with the ambient lighting and does not produce unnatural light artifacts or overexposed areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing orbs placed around the robot emit a soft light that blends harmoniously with the ambient lighting within the glass jar. This emission is localized and controlled, avoiding unnatural brightness or overexposure which would detract from the steampunk aesthetic. This technique is common in creating ambient motifs where lighting enhances rather than overwhelms the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the etched patterns on the base of the glass jar sharp, detailed, and stylistically coherent with the steampunk aesthetic, without blurring or irregular lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases etched patterns on the base of the glass jar that are finely engraved, with sharp, detailed lines. These patterns incorporate gears and mechanical designs typical of steampunk themes, maintaining stylistic coherence without blurring or irregularities often associated with lower quality or hastily made engravings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the rusted metal background match the color and texture of the robot’s materials and blend seamlessly without visible edges or tonal inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a rusted metal surface with colors and textures that complement the robot's aesthetics, which include industrial materials such as brass and copper. This seamless blend without visible inconsistencies aids in creating a unified steampunk scene, where both elements support the theme without stark contrasts or demarcation lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"
