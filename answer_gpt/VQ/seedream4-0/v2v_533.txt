    "Question": "Q1: Are the guitar and microphone depicted in a chibi-style 3D design while maintaining their original shapes and proportions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar and microphone are rendered in a stylized, toy-like chibi appearance which simplifies features and exaggerates proportions typical of chibi designs.
