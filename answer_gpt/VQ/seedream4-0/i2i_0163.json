      "question": "Does the outdoor camping scene seamlessly integrate with the toasters, maintaining consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters are placed in an outdoor setting with a tent in the background. The lighting in the outdoor scene suggests sunlight coming from a specific direction, and the shadows on the toasters are consistent with this direction, indicating an integration with the overall scene lighting. The shadows cast by the toasters match the direction and strength of the outdoor lighting, suggesting consistency in the integration process.",

      "question": "Are the toasters placed naturally on the folding table without any visible distortion in the table's texture or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of the toasters on the folding table in Image B appears natural, with no visible distortion or misalignment. The table's texture and lines remain consistent and undistorted, indicating that the toasters have been integrated realistically onto the table.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sunlight effects on the toast create realistic highlights and shadows on both the toast and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunlight in Image B creates distinct highlights and shadows on the toast, showing a realistic interaction with the natural light conditions. The way the light falls on the toast matches the direction of the sunlight in the outdoor scene, producing plausible shadows and highlights that align with the lighting conditions observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements smooth, without any noticeable artifacts or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the background camping scene and the foreground elements, including the toasters, appears smooth. There are no noticeable artifacts or abrupt changes that would suggest inconsistency or missing details, indicating a seamless integration of all elements in the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the toasters remained intact and physically plausible in the new outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The toasters in Image B maintain their original proportions and shapes, consistent with the physical characteristics observed in Image A. The integration into the outdoor scene hasn't distorted their appearance, and they fit naturally into the new setting.",
