    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes and mouth appear to follow the design from Image A, maintaining similar positioning and proportions. The stylization in Image B keeps the essence of the original plush design, ensuring that these features are consistent. Image A, the original plush, has eyes and mouth placed centrally on the face, and this has been preserved in Image B despite the stylized cartoon rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lasso is drawn above the horse's head, in a position that suggests twirling without intersecting the horse's body. The placement and shape both indicate movement and are positioned naturally relative to the horse's position.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cacti and buildings are aligned horizontally, maintaining perspective within the cartoon landscape. Their shadows are consistent with the direction of the light source coming from above, aligning with general knowledge of light casting shadows downward.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a simplified, cartoon version of the horse and its base. The fur texture and plastic details are stylized, making them less intricate compared to the realistic representation in Image A. The stylization has led to some oversimplification, causing loss of detailed texture.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is placed prominently at the top of the image and doesn't overlap with the horse or background elements, ensuring clear visibility. This design ensures no distraction from the other elements below.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon adaptation shows the legs and base in a stylized format, modifying their proportions slightly to fit the art style. While they retain the essential form and function seen in Image A, the proportions are not accurately consistent with the original mechanical structure due to stylization.",
