      "explanation": "Image B shows a brightly colored umbrella that matches the vibrant and playful tone of the chibi character. The umbrella maintains a smooth texture and realistic reflective surface, which is consistent with the high-quality 3D rendering. Its interaction with the environment and character is natural and free from distortions.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall and drainpipe retain realistic textures, mimicking materials like concrete or plaster effectively. The water flow from the pipe interacts naturally with the ground, creating realistic reflections and splashes. This fluid dynamic is visually credible and free of artifacts, ensuring seamless integration into the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the green jacket and boots with smooth surfaces typical of 3D character design. While detailed textures are simplified, they maintain a consistent cartoon aesthetic appropriate for the chibi style. This simplicity does not result in the loss of expected detail nor the introduction of artifacts, aligning with the coherent visual language of the image.",
