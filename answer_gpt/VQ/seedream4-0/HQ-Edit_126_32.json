      "question": "Do the luminescent ferns in the canopy have consistent, organic shapes and smooth gradients that resemble real plant growth patterns without pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent ferns appear to have organic shapes typical of fern leaves with smooth gradients and transitions in their luminosity. There are no visible pixelation or jagged edges, which suggests a design that mimics real plant growth patterns effectively. The visual information combined with common knowledge about plant morphology leads to the conclusion that the ferns have smooth and consistent shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver tribal patterns on the bark aligned with the natural contours of the trunk and free from floating, misaligned, or unnaturally sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver tribal patterns in Image B follow the natural intertwining structure of the trunk, enhancing the impression of alignment with the tree's contours. There are no visible instances of floating or misaligned patterns, and the edges of the patterns are smooth, without unnatural sharpness. This design technique demonstrates a seamless integration into the trunk’s organic flow, leading to the assessment that the patterns are well-aligned.",

      "question": "Are the translucent wings extending from the canopy smoothly connected to the tree’s branches, showing gradual transparency and consistent layering without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits translucent wings that smoothly transition from the branches of the canopy. The transparency of the wings is gradual and well-layered, creating a realistic depiction of how such could appear if organically integrated. There are no visible seams or geometric distortions, indicating a well-executed connection between the wings and the tree branches.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glass-like fibers forming the trunk exhibit realistic light refraction, consistent thickness variation, and continuous flow without abrupt breaks or unnatural twists?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass-like fibers making up the trunk demonstrate realistic light refraction, with the variations in thickness suggesting an organic and dynamic structure. The flow of these fibers is continuous, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural twists noted. This observation suggests a design that maintains a natural flow and realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing tendrils extend from the tree base into the ground with smooth curvature and consistent luminosity, without intersecting the grass unnaturally or showing flat, non-continuous surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing tendrils in Image B extend from the base with a smooth curvature and consistent luminosity. They appear to interact naturally and seamlessly with the grass, maintaining continuous and flowing surfaces. There are no signs of unnatural intersections or flat areas, indicating a cohesive design that integrates well with the surrounding environment.",
