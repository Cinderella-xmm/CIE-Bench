    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the monocled eye on the front face of the clock seamlessly integrated into the original frame, with no visible seam or texture discontinuity around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocled eye is located on the front face of the robot, built to appear as part of a steampunk-style design. The frame around the monocle is circular and integrated with gear motifs, blending into the mechanical aesthetic seamlessly without disrupting the overall surface continuity. However, since this is a fantasy-like transformation from a clock to a robot, the notion of seamless texture integration may be more subjective. Given the style and integration with gears and steampunk elements, it does appear well integrated with no abrupt cessation of texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gear-like limbs extend from the side panels of the clock with continuous material flow and geometric alignment, showing no signs of floating or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's limbs are designed to resemble steampunk mechanics, with visible joints and gears connecting at various hinges. These elements appear intentionally aligned and attached, forming a cohesive unit without appearing disconnected or floating. The design suggests functional, integrated movement, in keeping with a well-constructed mechanical structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pendulum converted into a tail that extends downward from the bottom center of the clock, maintaining a smooth curvature and consistent material texture with the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pendulum in Image B is reimagined as part of the robot's hand-held object rather than an elongated tail. The object fits with the intricate steampunk style, maintaining texture consistency and curvature that aligns with the rest of the metallic and mechanical components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper tones applied uniformly across the clock’s surface, matching the lighting direction and showing realistic reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is designed with a coherent copper and brass color palette that reflects steampunk aesthetics. The tones are consistent across the robot's surface, accounting for realistic lighting effects that cast appropriate shadows and highlights, enhancing the perception of depth and volume in a manner that aligns with the light source from the right side.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the steam valves placed at each corner of the clock’s upper section, protruding outward with clean edges and no overlap or deformation of the surrounding structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steam valves are placed on top of the robot's body, contributing to the steampunk theme. They protrude realistically, maintaining clear edges and do not distort or disrupt the surrounding mechanical components, thereby preventing any apparent overlapping or deformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns along the clock’s base and sides clear, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the original ornamental design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental engravings transformed into mechanical gear motifs that articulate steampunk aesthetics. Although they deviate from traditional ornamental designs, they exhibit clarity and consistent stylistic elements appropriate for the robotic design, suggesting detailed attention to aesthetic consistency with the new theme.",
