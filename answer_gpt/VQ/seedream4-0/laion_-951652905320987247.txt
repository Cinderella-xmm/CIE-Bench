    "Question": "Q1: Does the snow-capped peak exhibit a consistent, non-uniform glittering texture that mimics natural snow while avoiding blocky or artificial sparkles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-capped peak shows a glittering texture that is enhanced with a sparkly, silvery effect, indicating it is artificial rather than natural. This is a common technique used in miniature or model designs to create an appealing visual effect. Natural snow would not typically have this uniform sparkle and would instead exhibit a more varied and less consistent reflective quality.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the tree lines and grasslands along the base of the mountain rendered with natural variation in color and density, without repeating brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tree lines and grasslands are part of a crafted miniature landscape within a glass bowl. The trees exhibit consistent sizing and coloring typical of scale models, lacking the natural variation found in real landscapes, and suggest the use of similar brush-like strokes or materials for their creation.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the lake surface uniformly reflective with no visible distortion, warping, or artificial shine that breaks the continuity of the mountain's reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lake surface reflects the miniature landscape above it, similar to how a body of water would reflect a scene. However, due to the reflective nature of the glass and possible light filtering through it, there may be slight distortions and an artificial appearance that is not typical of an actual lake. These factors create an impression of artificiality.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the chalet figurines positioned at ground level along the shoreline with proper scale and shadow alignment, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chalet figurines are part of the miniature display and are positioned consistently at the base of the scene. They appear well-integrated with the landscape and their shadows and alignment seem properly scaled and consistent with the overall direction of light, suggesting an attention to detail in the model's crafting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible seams, distortions, or artificial reflections around the perimeter of the scene that suggest an unnatural glass boundary?",
    "explanation": "Image B clearly shows an artificial glass boundary as the mountain scene is encapsulated within a glass bowl. This creates visible distortions and potentially artificial reflections around the perimeter, characteristic of light interactions with a curved glass surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
