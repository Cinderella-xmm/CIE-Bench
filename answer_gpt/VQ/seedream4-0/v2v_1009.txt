    "Question": "Q1: Does the bowl maintain a clean, semi-transparent appearance without any unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl is made of glass, which is inherently semi-transparent. Its clean and uninterrupted surface does indeed fit the description of being free from unnatural textures or broken shapes. Observing closely, the bowl outlines are smooth, and there are no irregularities in its geometry or texture, which suggests it maintains a clean, semi-transparent appearance.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the reflections and soft shadows on the vegetables and bowl accurately depicted without causing any unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "The reflections and shadows in Image B appear consistent with a natural lighting environment. There are no obvious distortions within the reflections on the glass bowl, and the shadows cast by the vegetables are soft and gradual, lending a realistic sense to the depiction. This suggests that reflections and shadows are accurately depicted.",
