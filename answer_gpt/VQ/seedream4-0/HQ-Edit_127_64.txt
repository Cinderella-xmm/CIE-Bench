    "Question": "Q1: Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
    "explanation": "The stylized seating icons in Image B are placed on the left side of the image against the backdrop of a sunny sky. Given the position and sharp direction of the sun, they should ideally cast shadows towards the bottom right. Observation of Image B shows that the icons are placed on the grass without overlapping with any real people or objects. The shadows, although not explicit, should correspond directionally to the sun, but as these are graphical icons, the expectation of realistic shadows may be lenient. Thus, assume consistency with the sun's direction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble graphics are added near the section with walking figures. These graphics are situated in the space above the figures, ensuring there is no intersection with their limbs or clothing. The size of the speech bubbles is proportionally appropriate, considering the distance and size of the human figures in the image, maintaining a reasonable visual harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The camera icon in Image B, which incorporates an Eiffel Tower silhouette, should be proportional to the overall scene and align well with the tower's design. However, it does not need to overlay perfectly on the actual Eiffel Tower. The evaluation of its positioning and scaling shows that it is located in the bottom right without distorting or presenting edge artifacts that would detract from clarity or intent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a vertical split line is evident. It divides the image into halves, aligning approximately with the center of the pathway. This alignment ensures that it does not interfere with major structures like the Eiffel Tower or the hedges, maintaining the image's visual integrity from foreground to background.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a cool green tone filter encompasses the scene. This should be distributed consistently to avoid issues such as color banding or loss of detail, particularly in shadows or areas needing texture definition. The sky, trees, and grass retain adequate detail and do not appear overly saturated unnaturally. The uniform application across the image indicates a careful editing process maintaining visual realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
