      "question": "Does the transition between the dog and the banana appear smooth and natural without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog appears similar to a toy or a cartoon figure due to the uniform color and lack of realistic shading, and the banana maintains its realistic look. The transition area where the dog and the banana meet is with no visible seam or attachment fixings, which gives it an unrealistic appearance when considering natural world proportions and materials, suggesting editing or cartoonization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the dog and the banana consistent with each other and the surrounding grass, indicating a natural light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana appears to have natural shading and highlights that are consistent with a real object in natural light. However, the dog figure shows a lack of complex shadows and highlights, resembling a manufactured object rather than an organic one. The lighting mismatch suggests artificial or edited lighting on the dog compared to the banana and grass.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the dog and the banana connect, disrupting the visual quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B appears to have an even, plastic-like texture rather than realistic fur details, which contrasts sharply with the banana's realistic texture. The area where they connect does not show any blending or texture matching that would typically occur in a natural setting, indicating a loss of detail and discrepancy in textures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the dog and the banana remain realistic and proportional to each other, avoiding any unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both Image A and B, the proportions suggest a humorous portrayal rather than realistic proportions, as the banana is oversized compared to the dogâ€”the size disparity is meant to create a contrast, not realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials of the dog's fur and the banana's peel retain their natural texture and appearance, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is rendered with a texture and coloration akin to a plastic model, lacking the natural fur details that would be expected in a realistic portrayal. Conversely, the banana maintains a realistic appearance, showing appropriate texture and color. The difference in these material representations detracts from the overall realism of the scene.",
