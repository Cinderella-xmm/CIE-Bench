    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome have natural transparency and refraction effects that match the lighting direction and shadow patterns from the window, without visible artifacts such as uneven edges or unrealistic glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is clearly visible and exhibits natural transparency, allowing the light from the window to pass through it smoothly, creating consistent shadow patterns on the surface below. The glass edges are uniformly curved, and there is an absence of any artificial glare which would suggest unrealistic rendering. Transparency and refraction appear realistic, matching the lighting and shadows without artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vintage wooden base visually consistent in color, texture, and grain pattern with the surrounding wooden table, and does the velvet lining appear soft and layered without pixelation or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a wooden base that harmonizes well with the table, employing a similar color palette and wood grain texture, suggesting they are part of a coherent setup. The velvet lining beneath the teapot appears well-defined with a realistic soft texture, lacking any pixelation or excessive shine, contributing to a natural layered appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid grow in a way that follows natural botanical form and maintains contact with the teapot's surface without floating or breaking geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants appear to naturally emerge from the spout and lid areas, showcasing a realistic botanical form. The stems and ferns maintain continuous contact with the teapot, reflecting authentic growth patterns without floating or displaying discontinuity in their geometric placement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterflies positioned at plausible flight heights and angles near the floral engravings, with visible wings and body details that match the scale and lighting of the scene, and do they cast subtle shadows on the teapot surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates butterflies located at realistic flight positions relative to the floral engravings. The butterfly's wings and body are detailed in a manner consistent with their size and the lighting conditions. They are appropriately angled for the scene, and the subtle shadows confirm their proximity to the teapot surface, indicating a plausible rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all newly added elements rendered in muted earth tones that blend seamlessly with the original silver teapot and wooden background, avoiding bright or jarring color contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added botanical elements, butterflies, and velvet lining are subdued in color, integrating smoothly with the silver and wood tones that dominate the scene. There are no bright or contrasting hues that could disrupt the cohesive visual aesthetic, ensuring the entire composition remains harmonious.",
