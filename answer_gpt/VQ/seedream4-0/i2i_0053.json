      "question": "Do the bananas retain a natural curvature and texture, avoiding any obvious distortion or unnatural shapes after being redrawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are drawn with a smooth curve, maintaining a shape that resembles a typical banana. Although they appear in a simplified chibi-style, they avoid any extreme distortions or unnatural forms that might misrepresent their appearance. The continuous contours and smooth lines support the notion of a natural shape within the context of a stylized drawing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the wooden base and metal stand preserve their material properties and structural coherence, without introducing unnatural textures or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base and metal stand are drawn with clean lines and consistent coloring which retains the structural coherence seen in the original object. The colors and shapes are simplified but still resemble the real-life materials they represent, indicating that the redrawing does not introduce any unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines around the bananas and stand clear and consistent, contributing to the chibi-style aesthetic without being overly thick or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines surrounding the bananas and the stand are consistent in width and clearly define the shapes in a manner typical of chibi-style illustrations. The outlines are neither excessively thick nor uneven, contributing well to the intended aesthetic by providing clear separation and emphasis to the cartoon elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the green hill background integrate seamlessly with the foreground elements, maintaining proportional logic and visual coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green hills serve as the background and integrate with the foreground elements by maintaining a drawn style that complements the overall cartoon look of the image. The hills are in proportion and do not overshadow the primary object in the foreground, creating a balanced and cohesive scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details on the bananas, such as the tips and edges, been preserved in the cartoon redraw, avoiding any loss or distortion that affects the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas have been simplified into a cartoon style which inherently reduces detail. While such styles prioritize simplicity and smoothness, the essence of the banana shape, including the rounded tips and main ridges, are maintained without major distortion. The appearance remains recognizable and natural within a stylized context.",
