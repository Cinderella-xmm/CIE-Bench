      "question": "Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, it is clear that the gorilla's body is crafted with a consistent wood texture and shading. The hue of the material mimics that of polished wood, and there are no abrupt changes in color or patches that deviate from the wood-like appearance. This careful craftsmanship is evident as the texture flows seamlessly across the body, reinforcing the idea of a homogeneous wooden sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fur patterns on the gorilla's body in Image B are intricately engraved, showing variations in depth and direction that mimic natural wood grain. This complexity in the pattern avoids any repetitive or synthetic appearance, conveying an organic feel that aligns with the artistry of wood carving. Such variations are typical in realistic wood sculptures, providing character and enhancing authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing Image B, the gorilla's arms and legs maintain anatomically correct proportions with appropriate joint articulation. There is no evidence of flattening or unnatural curves caused by excessive smoothing. The transitions between joint sections are well-defined, preserving the accurate depiction of a gorilla's physical structure in the context of a wooden carving.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is composed of etched wood patterns, where darker leaf shapes are skillfully integrated. This integration maintains depth and layering, contributing to a cohesive visual presentation alongside the gorilla. The design ensures that the elements do not appear flat or disjointed, but rather harmonize as part of a comprehensive woodwork scene, typical of detailed carvings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scattered leaves in the background of Image B are rendered in darker wood tones, contributing to depth and contrast against the lighter wooden surface. Their placement suggests a natural resting or embedding into the surface, avoiding any appearance of floating or incorrect overlapping. Such strategic positioning of elements reinforces the artful integration typical of woodwork designs, ensuring an organic and grounded appearance.",
