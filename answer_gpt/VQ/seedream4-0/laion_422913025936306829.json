      "question": "Are the color blocks applied across the shirtâ€™s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a mural with bright, neon-colored sections that are very vivid and distinct. The colors are adjacent but are sharply delineated by the outlines within the artwork, giving each section a crisp and clear appearance. This indicates no blending or smudging between adjacent areas, particularly in the neon design choices for mural art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns and bright neon colors in Image B seem to be consistently applied in a way that reflects the intricate geometric designs and other elements consistent with optical art and street murals. However, the layout isn't repeated in a patterned way across the surface of the mural; rather, it forms a singular, cohesive artwork designed to fit within the specific section of the wall.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the figure's limbs and torso seem artistically stylized but maintain a degree of realism. The anatomy appears intentionally exaggerated for artistic effect, common in street art and murals, yet the depiction does not present broken or unnaturally distorted joints. The proportions maintain an expressive form without violating physical realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mural exhibits a high level of detailed artwork. Even though the facial features cannot be evaluated due to the blurring, the hair and ornamental lines demonstrate a high degree of clarity and detail, indicative of precise and unbroken lines characteristic of detailed mural work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular frame and geometric shapes in Image B appear designed to aesthetically balance and enclose the central figure. The alignment seems intentional, with no apparent distortion or misalignment. The consistency in how the shapes are presented aligns with typical artistic considerations for such murals.",
