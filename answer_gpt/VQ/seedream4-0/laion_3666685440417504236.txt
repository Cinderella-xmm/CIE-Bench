    "Question": "Q1: Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dome and arches appear geometrically intact and proportionally similar to architectural norms. The lines are smooth with no visible warping or breakage. This design indicates a precise and careful adaptation of the original building's architecture into a globular setting. Without any apparent anomalies, these elements maintain visual integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and cobblestone path harmonize with the surrounding architecture's scale. The trees are appropriately sized relative to the buildings, and the cobblestone path logically leads to the entrance, emphasizing a seamless and plausible layout. Such design consideration ensures a realistic and convincing miniature scene alignment within the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
    "explanation": "On Image B's globe's exterior, the Persian patterns are continuous and evenly spaced, exuding an aesthetic consistent with traditional tilework motifs. These patterns echo those seen in Middle Eastern architecture, especially from the architectural influence present in Image A, ensuring stylistic coherence and cultural authenticity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
    "explanation": "Golden highlights in Image B are strategically placed, simulating natural illumination effects on the dome and arches. The highlights appear nuanced and incorporate subtle gradients, conveying depth and reflecting real-world light interaction, thus avoiding any flatness or artificial appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "The globe's boundary in Image B exhibits a crisp transition between the interior scene and its surface. There is no evidence of jaggedness or glitches; the design seems precisely executed, suggesting careful attention to detail without irregularities or distracting reflections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
