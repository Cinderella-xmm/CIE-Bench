      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features of the scientist proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes such as elongated eyes, misaligned nose, or uneven lip contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the scientist in a cartoon-like or digital art style. The facial features are consistent with stylized character designs often found in illustrations, which might deliberately use exaggerated proportions for artistic effect. Typically, such styles do not adhere to realistic proportions, with features like oversized eyes, simplified nose shapes, and emphasized outlines. Therefore, while these features might be proportionally accurate within the context of styled digital art, they would not conform to real-world proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lab coat exhibit natural fabric folds and subtle shading consistent with real-world draping, without appearing uniformly flat or lacking depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lab coat is rendered in a simplified, flat graphic style typical of cartoon or digital illustrations. Such styles favor cleaner lines and uniform surfaces over detailed textures and realistic shading, making them appear less lifelike when compared to real-world garments, which show detailed draping and varying shades indicating folds and depth.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the pipette have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are the joints and knuckles positioned realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a hand in a stylized illustration form. Such artistic styles often simplify anatomical details, occasionally altering proportions or skipping realistic joint depictions for simplicity or aesthetic purposes. Given the style, the hand may lack the detailed curvature and articulation seen in realistic human hands, potentially missing accurate joint and knuckle definition.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the test tubes display uniform liquid levels and clear glass surfaces with coherent reflections and refractions, without visible texture distortions or broken geometric outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the test tubes are depicted in a cartoon style that prioritizes simplified forms and flat colors. Such representations often ignore physical properties like reflections, refractions, or precise geometric lines. The focus is more on a clean and simplified visual effect rather than adherence to realistic optical characteristics you would find in actual glass objects filled with liquid.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the components of the microscope and adjacent control panel correctly aligned and proportionally scaled, with no misplaced parts or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the microscope and control panel are stylized illustrations. The emphasis here is on simplicity and visual appeal rather than mechanical accuracy. Such artwork may intentionally simplify or adapt scientific tools for aesthetic purposes, possibly including disproportionate scaling or lack of detailed component alignment. While artistic styles often preserve recognizable shapes, they do not necessarily follow real-world physics or technology conventions.",
