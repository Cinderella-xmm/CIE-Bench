    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monochrome line drawings are superimposed on the butterfly to represent its anatomy. These lines adhere closely to the butterfly's natural contours, following the shapes and positions of its antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax without deviating significantly. The lines do not overlap incorrectly or create geometric distortions. In comparison to Image A (original), where these anatomical lines are absent, Image B effectively adds these educational elements without compromising the butterfly’s anatomical integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any additional pink petals beyond those already present in Image A. The pink petals seen in both images are part of the original composition. These petals are naturally integrated with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment across both images with no visible seams or artificial edges, maintaining a harmonious appearance within the floral setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text boxes are strategically placed to provide descriptions without overlapping the butterfly or prominent floral elements. They are positioned in parts of the image with less detail to ensure the butterfly and flowers remain the focal points. The text is set against a contrasting background making it readable while maintaining a visual balance. Compared to Image A, which lacks text, Image B introduces these elements thoughtfully without obstructing the main subjects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the vibrant blue color of the butterfly’s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vibrant blue color of the butterfly’s wings in Image B remains uniformly intact. Even beneath the overlaid anatomical lines, there is no visible discoloration or loss of detail. The butterfly’s wings maintain their vivid and intricate appearance, similar to Image A, which provides the base reference for color consistency.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures in the areas where edits were made (e.g., line drawings, text boxes, added petals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits clean edits with smooth line drawings and uniformly integrated text boxes. There are no visible artifacts like jagged lines or pixelation; the textures remain natural. The integrity of the original image's quality is upheld, ensuring the additions do not introduce disruptive visual elements.",
