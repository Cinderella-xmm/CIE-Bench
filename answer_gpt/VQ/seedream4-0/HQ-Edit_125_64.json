      "question": "Is the sun disc replacing the Sphinx’s head seamlessly integrated with the neck and body, showing no jagged edges or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun disc sits behind what remains visible of the Sphinx's neck and appears as a cohesive part of the composition. The integration seems smooth as it is designed to look like a natural connection between the neck and the iconic sun motif, using world knowledge of Egyptian symbolism. There is no indication of any rough edges or misalignments.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden wings extend symmetrically from the sides of the Sphinx’s body with smooth, continuous surfaces and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the golden wings are depicted as an extension of the Sphinx's body, emanating symmetrically from each side. Their surface appears smooth, and the curvature looks natural, aligning with common artistic representations of winged creatures in mythology that emphasize symmetry and elegant form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the sand flows on the limbs continuous and gravity-consistent, without abrupt breaks or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the sand flows down the limbs portray realistic behavior of gravity-driven materials. They follow the contours of the limbs without noticeable discontinuities or unnatural floating particles, suggesting careful attention to maintaining continuous and gravity-consistent depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ankhs on the paws correctly shaped, properly scaled, and emitting a soft, localized glow without distorting adjacent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ankhs held by the Sphinx’s paws are represented proportionally and are shaped according to traditional ankh iconography. The glow they emit is localized and soft, enhancing their presence without affecting or distorting the surrounding textures and surfaces of the paws.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire edited figure exhibit consistent lighting and shading across all added elements, with no visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of the edited Sphinx in Image B shows a coherent application of lighting and shading. The elements added, such as wings, the sun disc, and the ankhs, are illuminated in a manner consistent with the background sunset. There are no apparent seams or texture mismatches that would suggest a disjointed edit.",
