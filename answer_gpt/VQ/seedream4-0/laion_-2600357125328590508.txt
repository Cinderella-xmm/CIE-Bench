    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sockâ€™s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO sock sculpture appears to follow the contours seen in Image A. The LEGO bricks seem to replicate the original sock's outlines effectively without showing any signs of warped or stretched geometry. This is evidenced by the alignment and proportional accuracy when considering the expected shape of a sock.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the construction of the LEGO sculpture seems to take into account the natural curves of an actual sock. The bricks are stacked in such a way that they create a smooth, cohesive 3D structure, suggesting the absence of any noticeable gaps or misaligned layers. This implies a precise alignment in respect to creating an organic replica.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the \"UNO\" text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the LEGO sock with a pattern arrangement that mirrors the original sock in Image A. The black, gray, and white LEGO bricks correspond closely to the color scheme and pattern layout, including details like the 'UNO' text and the various stripes that appear consistent with the original sock design, avoiding any apparent color mismatches.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the orange LEGO piece is situated at the top of the sock sculpture. It appears to be well-integrated into the structure rather than floating or seem like an unnatural attachment. This integration suggests careful consideration in maintaining the continuity of the LEGO build.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO sculpture presented in an upright position against a clean, uniform gallery-like background. The lighting appears to be even, sufficiently illuminating the sculpture and highlighting its 3D form without creating unnatural shadows or reflections, thus ensuring the clarity of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
