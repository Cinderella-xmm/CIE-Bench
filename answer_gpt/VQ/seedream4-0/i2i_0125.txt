    "Question": "Q3: Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text 'Fresh' at the bottom left and 'Sweet' at the top right?",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the alignment of the text 'Fresh' at the bottom left and 'Sweet' at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
    "explanation": "The text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' is strategically placed in complementary corners of the image: one at the bottom left and the other at the top right. This arrangement provides a balanced framing without encroaching on the main subject - the apples - thereby preserving visual harmony.",
