      "question": "Are the girl, stone platform, and frisbee free of unnatural distortions or artifacts, appearing structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a girl standing on a stone platform holding a frisbee. The objects, including the girl, the stone, and the frisbee, appear to have natural shapes and contours. The edges are smooth and the objects do not show signs of warping or artifacts that indicate distortion in editing. This suggests coherence in structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass and blue sky background integrate smoothly with the foreground elements, avoiding obvious seams or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the image, the transition between the grass field and the sky appears natural, without visible seams or edits that could indicate a lack of smooth integration. The textures of the grass and the sky also appear consistent with natural observation, showing no signs of digital alteration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the girl, stone platform, and frisbee adhere to the golden ratio principles in their positioning, creating a balanced and visually credible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition features the girl centrally placed on the stone platform, holding the frisbee which adds to the balance of the scene. While the placement is effective for balance, the golden ratio is a specific mathematical principle of aesthetic balance that might not always apply strictly but is often associated with subjectively pleasing arrangements. In this case, while the composition seems visually pleasing, there is no clear indication that it strictly adheres to the golden ratio.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details like the texture of the girl's clothing, the surface of the stone platform, and the frisbee preserved clearly without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image retains details such as the fabric texture of the girl's dress, the stone's surface roughness, and the frisbee's design, all of which appear sharp and without pixelation or blur that would suggest image quality loss.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee match the lighting conditions of the new grass and sky background, avoiding mismatched shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee in the image appears to be consistent with the lighting of the surrounding environment, with similar highlights and shadows that correspond with the sun's likely position. This suggests a coherent integration of lighting conditions with the background.",
