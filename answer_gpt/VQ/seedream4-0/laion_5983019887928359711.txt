    "Question": "Q1: Does the hair exhibit consistent curl patterns and volumetric continuity without visible distortions such as broken strands, unnatural bulges, or abrupt changes in thickness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears smooth, with consistent curl patterns and volumetric uniformity. The curls are well-defined and evenly distributed, without any abrupt changes in thickness or visible distortions. This can be determined by observing the continuity in curl shapes and their symmetrical arrangement, reflecting a well-rendered 3D look typical in digital character models.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the golden embroidery patterns evenly spaced and continuous along the red coat, with no jagged edges or missing segments that suggest artifacting?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the embroidery on the red coat clearly, with well-spaced and continuous golden patterns that maintain consistent shape and size. The smooth edges and lack of missing segments suggest a high-quality representation devoid of artifacting typically seen in digital rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the blue sash follow a smooth, gravity-consistent drape from the shoulder to the waist without unnatural creases or overlapping inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blue sash is depicted flowing smoothly over the shoulder and resting naturally down the waist. It lacks any unnatural creases or overlapping areas that would imply graphical inconsistency. The depiction reveals a gravity-consistent drape, aligning with an understanding of clothing physics in 3D models.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the surfaces of the coat, sash, and skin show coherent shading and specular reflections that align with a single light source, avoiding inconsistent gloss or floating highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B demonstrates coherent shading and reflections across the coat, sash, and visible parts of skin, which are consistent with a single light source. Specular highlights and gloss seem to be well positioned, indicating a unified lighting setup without any floating highlights or inconsistent gloss, typical for accurate digital renderings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the white lace cravat properly aligned with the neck and collar, with no distortion, clipping, or unnatural stretching of the lace pattern?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the white lace cravat is depicted correctly aligned with the neck and collar, maintaining its integrity throughout its length. The lace pattern appears natural, with no signs of distortion, clipping, or stretching that would compromise its appearance, suggesting a high fidelity in its digital recreation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
