      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine displays visually consistent and symmetrical proportions in its limbs, torso, and overall stance, similar to what one would expect from an accurately designed action figure. The armor fits snugly with clean lines, indicating no broken geometric shapes or distortions. This shows deliberate design and execution that ensures anatomical logic and physical rationality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting effects, particularly the glow from the hammer and the circular base, are visually consistent, suggesting integration with the figurine's surface. The light casts appropriate highlights and shadows, maintaining a natural appearance that confirms they are well-rendered and compatible with the environment, avoiding stark or unrealistic contrasts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the hammer in Image B appears well-formed with details such as knuckles and fingers, fitting the proportion and not exceeding the anatomical limit of five fingers. There is no visible ergonomic distortion, and the grip on the hammer looks natural and comfortably designed for hold.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the plastic figurine retained a structurally sound head and face consistent with the character's identity, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the face being blurred in Image B, the structure of the head, including the hair and placement, is consistent with the expected character representation. The presence of clear, sculpted hair indicates that structurally it seems sound, with no obvious loss of cohesion or detail apparent in this region.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the armor and cape of the plastic figurine appear cohesive with the rest of the figurine, avoiding any unnatural textures or materials that disrupt the visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows armor and cape that are well-integrated with the plastic figurine. The materials appear consistent in sheen and texture with what is expected from a figurine of this type. The cape flows naturally over the shoulder, adhering to the figurine's overall aesthetic and maintaining a cohesive look.",
