      "question": "Do the chibi-fied players maintain a natural appearance without introducing unnatural textures or artefacts that disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-fied players in Image B are depicted in a stylized cartoon format, which inherently differs from realistic textures as seen in Image A. However, for animated or chibi-style illustration, the use of clean lines and consistent color palettes fulfills the expectation of authenticity within its style. There are no visible artefacts or defects that suggest disruption. Within the context of a chibi style, they maintain a consistent and expected appearance for this art form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the outfits and hairstyles of the chibi-fied players proportionally and physically rational, avoiding any distortion that conflicts with the natural appearance of the players?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi style of Image B, the characters are designed with exaggerated features, which is typical for this art form. The outfits and hairstyles are simplified yet recognizable, maintaining the playful and cohesive appearance expected of a chibi character. There are no distortions beyond the stylistic simplifications, so within this context, they are proportionally and physically rational.",

      "question": "Does the act of the chibi-fied players holding tennis rackets and shaking hands seem structurally consistent and free from deformation, fitting naturally into the pastoral setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are holding tennis rackets and shaking hands in a clear and recognizable gesture. Although the setting has shifted to a cartoon-style environment, the action is captured well-fitting within the chibi fashion of the image. The structure of their poses does not seem awkward or anatomically incorrect within the chibi style, ensuring consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the semi-transparent court logo in the background appear naturally integrated and does not introduce any visual distractions or distortions that detract from the sceneâ€™s authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The court logo in the background of Image B appears semi-transparent over the green context, which is typical in illustrations or designs to suggest a thematic setting without overshadowing the main subjects. It is subtle enough to not distract from the characters, blending into the background without causing visual distortion. Therefore, it appears naturally integrated into the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the inclusion of chibi-fied players with tennis rackets and the court logo maintain the image's compositional balance and visual plausibility, without disrupting the natural arrangement of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-fied players are the central focus, with the court logo providing thematic context. The balance is maintained as the primary elements are centered, and there is no overcrowding within the scene. The visual plausibility aligns with the chibi and cartoon style, contrasting with Image A's realistic pastoral setting, but in its context, it maintains compositional balance.",
