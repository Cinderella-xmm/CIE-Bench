    "Question": "Q1: Are all six dolls proportionally scaled with consistent body structure, showing no distorted limbs, oversized heads, or irregular shapes?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the six dolls seem to exhibit a proportional scaling consistent with typical nested dolls. No disproportionate elements such as distorted limbs, oversized heads, or irregular shapes are evident, despite varying sizes. This proportionality in appearance is typical of hand-crafted nested dolls, where each doll is a scaled variation of the other, keeping the design consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do all six dolls clearly display the original figureâ€™s beard, headwear, and distinctive robe patterns in a simplified but consistent manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls have varied features that include simplified elements mimicking the original figure's design like headwear and robe patterns. However, the beard, a distinct element of the original figure, appears only on one of the dolls which is more anthropomorphic. The non-uniformity in consistently displaying these features simplifies each doll distinctively, not uniformly adhering to every single aspect of the original figure across all dolls.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the dark-wood desk textured realistically with visible grain, proper shadows, and correct scale relative to the dolls, and is it fully grounded beneath them without floating or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a dark-wood desk with realistic textures including visible grain and shadows, matching traditional wooden furniture designs. The desk's scale seems appropriate relative to the dolls, providing a grounded surface without any visible floatation or misalignment, suggesting that the dolls are correctly placed atop the desk.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the robes on the dolls exhibit smooth, curved folds consistent with a breeze, without jagged lines, unnatural stretching, or broken textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robes on each doll demonstrate smooth and curved folds consistent with artistic representations of clothing flowing in breeze-like patterns. The lines are seamless without jaggedness or texture errors, maintaining artistic consistency with traditional doll garment design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all dolls have hands with exactly five fingers, properly shaped and spaced, without extra digits or deformed joints?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that not all dolls visually represent exactly five fingers, due to simplified designs typical of nested dolls where detailed features, including fingers, are often minimized or stylized for artistic and manufacturing reasons. Therefore, the simplification results in deviations wherein some dolls might not exhibit intricate hand features like precise finger count.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the orange and blue colors consistently applied across all six dolls without color bleeding, mismatched tones, or unexpected gradients?",
    "explanation": "Image B illustrates a consistent application of orange and blue tones across all dolls. The colors are uniform and cleanly applied, adhering to a palette typically seen in artistic or craft work, without signs of color bleeding, mismatch, or unexpected gradients that might disrupt the uniformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
