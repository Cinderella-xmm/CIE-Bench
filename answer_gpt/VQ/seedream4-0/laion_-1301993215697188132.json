      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the owl's head retain proper geometric proportions with a beak that aligns with the jawline and eyes that are symmetrically placed and shaped like those of a real owl?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the image, the owl's head appears well proportioned. The beak aligns logically with the jawline, suggesting natural anatomical consistency. However, without clear indicators on the owl's facial structure behind the blur, it's challenging to definitively assess symmetry of the eyes and their shape, but the available features maintain an owl-like appearance based on common knowledge. The head resembles what would be expected from an owl, indicating proper geometric proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feathers on the cloak consistent in direction, shading, and density, and do they blend naturally with the original blue color without visible seams or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers on the cloak appear to be uniformly directed and maintain consistent shading and density throughout the cloak. There is no visible pixelation or seams, suggesting a smooth transition into the owl's original cloak color. The continuity of feather placement and integration with the blue color supports the idea of a natural blend.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses resting securely on the beak with correct reflection and shadow placement, and do they match the size and style of typical reading glasses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not provide explicit detail about glasses resting on the beak, as they seem to be absent. Observing the regions around the blurred face, there are no indications of reflections or shadows related to eyewear. Hence, it can be concluded that there are no glasses present, thus not matching typical reading glasses.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hand replaced with a wing-like structure that has logical joint placement and feather coverage, and does it lack extra fingers or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wing-like structure replacing the hand appears appropriately jointed and covered in feathers, reflecting a natural placement similar to a bird's anatomy. There are no extra fingers or unnatural bends, with the appendage resembling typical bird wings in form and function.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed adjacent to the beak, contain legible text with contrasting colors, and do not overlap with other elements like the microphone or feathers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles are positioned horizontally along the owl, aligning well with the beak region. The text within the bubbles is illegible, suggesting issues with text clarity and contrast. They do not appear to intersect with microphones or the feathers, indicating no physical overlap with other elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branches extend from the background with natural tapering and bark texture, and are they positioned behind the subject without casting incorrect shadows or appearing flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches extending from the background demonstrate a natural tapering, with subtle bark-like texture. Their positioning behind the owl maintains a clear separation, without casting any unnatural shadows or appearing visually flat. Their integration into the backdrop denotes a realistic placement and depth.",
