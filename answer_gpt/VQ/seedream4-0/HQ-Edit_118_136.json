      "question": "Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater's entire body is covered with a shiny metallic armor that appears to fit well, maintaining the natural shape and size of human anatomy. There aren't any visible distortions or proportions that stray from how armor would logically fit a human body. The joints like knees and elbows are depicted fluidly, suggesting mobility and realistic articulation, which confirms that the armor maintains anatomical proportions without unnatural bends.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hoverboard’s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hoverboard has a transparent deck with glowing effects. The board's transparent part is smooth and well-defined, with even glow effects around it, maintaining consistency in shape and avoiding any irregularities or digital artifacts. The uniformity of the glow suggests high-quality rendering without broken edges, enhancing the hoverboard’s futuristic look.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graffiti on the walls and ramps has been transformed into what appears to be animated digital displays. The artwork showcases luminous colors with smooth transitions and no jagged outlines or pixelation. This implies a higher level of digital artistry, imitating animated displays that have vibrant and fluid movements traditionally associated with digital screens.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard emit a glow that gently illuminates the surrounding environment. The reflections are subtle and consistent, enhancing key features without oversaturating or causing unrealistic effects on nearby surfaces. The lighting effects maintain a balance, preventing any harsh reflections or excessive color bleeding which would distort the overall scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines, which denote movement, are carefully aligned with the skater's direction and trajectory. They complement the overall action portrayal without intersecting or overlapping with key body features like limbs or obstructing the hoverboard unnaturally. The positioning follows a logical and coherent flow of motion, enhancing the dynamic look without disrupting the image composition.",
