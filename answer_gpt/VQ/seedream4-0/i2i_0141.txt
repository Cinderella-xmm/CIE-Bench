    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs free from unnatural textures and maintain detailed edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of the couple have been replaced with a crystal-like material. The texture of the crystal appears faceted, consistent with natural crystal surfaces, which typically have geometric shapes. These surfaces reflect and refract light, which is evident in the image. The edges are detailed and consistent with the appearance of a crystalline structure, creating a sharp and clear outline. Given these observations, the textures are not unnatural and the edges are appropriately detailed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs integrate naturally with the background and the bench, without creating visible breaks or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal silhouettes are positioned on the bench, fitting the contours and position of where a seated couple would typically be. There are no evident breaks or distortions between the bench and the silhouettes, implying a seamless integration. The crystalline material doesn't seem to interrupt the continuity of the image, indicating a natural fit with the background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the proportions and shapes of the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs realistic and consistent with human anatomy, avoiding exaggerated or distorted forms?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation into crystal, the silhouettes retain the proportions and shapes typical of seated human figures. The anatomical features such as shoulders, arms, and back align well with human forms without exaggerated or distorted forms due to the material change. The proportions appear realistic, maintaining consistency with human anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the crystal material used for the silhouettes of the couple's backs appear three-dimensional and transparent, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal material is designed to be faceted and partly transparent, allowing light to pass through and reflect. This creates a three-dimensional effect, enhancing the natural appearance. Transparency in crystals typically contributes to a realistic depiction of the material, and this is evident in how the light interacts with the silhouettes in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs still convey the impression that the couple is seated naturally on the bench, maintaining spatial coherence?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the crystal silhouettes in a position typical for seated individuals, with proper alignment on the bench. The seating position and spatial relationship between the elements are consistent as seen traditionally with seated figures. Despite the material change, the coherence of the space between the bench and the silhouettes is maintained, preserving the natural impression of seated positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
