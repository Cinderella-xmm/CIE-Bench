    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is housed within a glass dome and reduced in size, which implies miniaturization. Despite this, the spikes, rivets, and scratches on the armor remain clearly visible. This indicates attention to detail in the miniaturization process. The surface details appear undistorted even though the figure is smaller, which suggests that the details were preserved in the editing process.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B covers the figure cleanly, with no visible seams or distortion affecting the view of the armor inside. The refraction effects are natural and do not obscure or warp the figureâ€™s appearance, suggesting high-quality rendering or photography.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheels at the base are visibly connected, with interlocking teeth that fit together, indicating thoughtful design. There are no floating or disconnected parts, and the proportions and alignments appear logical, simulating a functional gear system.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features mechanical wings that appear to be attached to the shoulder armor. The wings match the metal texture and spike design of the armor, and there are no visible issues such as unnatural bends or misaligned joints. This suggests a coherent and well-designed integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the copper pipes are shown running along the armor, maintaining a continuous and smooth path. They have a consistent diameter and bend gracefully without intersecting with critical parts of the armor. This denotes careful planning and execution in the design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass orbs in Image B are suspended at different distances but are not in contact with the figure or dome, avoiding any clipping issues. They also share a uniform material finish and lighting, showing consistency in the overall presentation.",
