      "question": "Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the hammer handle appears to be seamlessly integrated without any visible signs of texture mismatch. The color and texture of the logo matches well with the surrounding wood and metal, indicating that it's a well-executed addition. The edges of the logo appear smooth, and there are no evident color contrasts or jagged edges that would make the logo stand out unnaturally. Based on these observations, the logo is visually consistent with the rest of the image.",

      "question": "Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the letters on the wood shavings appear to follow the curvature and thickness of the shavings reasonably well. They do not seem to be floating or appear stretched in a way that contradicts the natural form of the shavings. The lettering adapts to the contours of the surface it is placed upon without significant distortion, reflecting a believable integration with the physical attributes of the shaving.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rustic banner at the top is slightly out of alignment with the scene's lighting and shadows. While its texture attempts to mimic that of aged wood or fabric, it does not seamlessly integrate with the overall lighting conditions of the environment, which suggests a slight discrepancy indicating a digital overlay. The lighting and shadows on the banner do not fully match the natural effects seen elsewhere in the image, which contributes to a feeling of being digitally inserted.",

      "question": "Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the copper accents on the pegboard are integrated well with the surrounding grayscale tones. They appear evenly lit and cast shadows consistent with the other objects in the scene. There are no abrupt color shifts or unrealistic reflections that would contradict their placement and material properties. The lighting and shading match the ambient conditions realistically, supporting a consistent overall tone in the image.",

      "question": "Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the business card is positioned accurately with respect to the perspective and scale of the surrounding tools and the workbench. It fits naturally within the spatial relationships presented in the scene, and it casts a shadow that is consistent with the primary light source evident elsewhere. This alignment indicates a correctly scaled and perspectively accurate placement of the card, contributing to a coherent visual integration with the scene.",
