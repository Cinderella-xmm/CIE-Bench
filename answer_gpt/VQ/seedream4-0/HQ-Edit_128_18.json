      "question": "Are the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves with consistent shading and no jagged edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green foliage motifs exhibit smooth, organically shaped leaves, typical of cartoon or illustrative designs often found in themed environments such as children's rooms or advertising imagery. The shading is consistent, and there are no visible jagged edges or pixelation, which would suggest a high-quality design or print. The cohesion of the visual style supports the impression of a seamless, high-quality illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal footprints on the floor are arranged in a way that suggests a playful or decorative intent rather than an accurate representation of an animal's gait. The footprints do not form a continuous, logical path that would be consistent with an actual giraffe or similar animal movement. Instead, they appear more artificial or stylized, which is common in decorative room settings aimed at children.",

      "question": "Is the clear packaging around each plush toy transparent with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toyâ€™s shape beneath, consistent with real plastic wrap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clear packaging around each plush toy displays transparency and surface highlights that indicate typical reflective properties of plastic wrap. Moreover, there is subtle distortion of the toy's shape beneath the packaging, which aligns with how plastic wrap interacts with light and object shapes in reality. The details in the design suggest a realistic depiction of plastic packaging.",

      "question": "Are the colorful letters on the wall aligned properly with the wall surface, showing no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful letters on the wall are flat against the wall surface and seem to have been designed with the space in mind. They show no signs of gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling, indicating they are well-aligned and integrated with the wall design. This results in a cohesive appearance, as expected in professional wall art or themed room decor.",

      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe exhibits consistent body proportions and the same soft fabric texture seen in the original Image A. There are no signs of stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams that would typically occur if changes were introduced during editing. The visual fidelity of the giraffe suggests that its original characteristics were preserved accurately.",
