      "question": "Does the metallic statue have five fingers on each hand, with natural joint angles and smooth surface transitions, and no visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic statue is depicted with high detail, showing five fingers on each hand. The fingers appear articulated with natural joint angles and the surface of the statue has smooth transitions, indicating skilled craftsmanship. No seams or distorted geometry are noticeable, pointing to a seamless construction of the statue. This perception is based on visual inspection and understanding of typical statue features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaves of the miniature trees in Image B exhibit semi-transparency which is evident as some light appears to pass through them. They are correctly scaled and positioned in such a way that they enhance the scene without compromising the integrity or scale of the statue, as they do not overlap the statue in an unrealistic manner. This observation is made using visual cues and knowledge of model environments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the engraved plaques flush with the base surface, with readable text and consistent depth, and do they follow the contour of the pedestal without appearing detached or warped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plaques appear neatly integrated with the pedestal surface. The engraved text seems readable and uniformly engraved, giving an impression of consistent depth. The plaques follow the curvature of the pedestal, blending seamlessly without signs of detachment or warping. This analysis is based on visual attributes of professionally engraved plaques and their correct placement.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with smooth, continuous curvature, showing accurate reflections of nearby objects and sky, and free from jagged edges or internal distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to possess complete transparency with a smooth, continuous curvature. It shows credible reflections of the surrounding environment, including the sky and nearby objects, maintaining optical realism. The surface lacks any jagged edges or distortions that would detract from its integrity. This assessment relies on visual inspection and knowledge of optical properties of glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome stand in Image B exhibits polished stone with slight texture variations typical of natural stone surfaces. The vine patterns are distinct and follow coherent growth trajectories that align with natural forms, without any unnatural breaks or repetition. This analysis is informed by visual inspection and understanding of natural stone and vine behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is accurately positioned above the statue and pedestal, resting securely on the dome stand. There is no evidence of clipping through any part of the statue or base, nor does it appear to float or tilt, suggesting a thoughtfully designed and stable placement. This conclusion is drawn from visual inspection while considering physical positioning principles.",
