      "question": "Does the dancer’s raised leg and arm maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment despite the stylized design, with no visible geometric distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's raised leg and arm are carefully crafted to maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment. The pose is dynamic and stylized, typical of depicting motion, but the anatomical structure is realistic, with no unnatural bending or distortion. This indicates an understanding of human anatomy, even within a stylized format.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the dancer's dress and accessories are clearly depicted with smooth and continuous lines.

      "question": "Do the huts and trees in the background exhibit smooth, curved forms consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics, without distorted silhouettes or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the huts and trees in the background are rendered with smooth and harmonious curves, typical of Art Nouveau aesthetics. They maintain a natural appearance with well-defined structures. There are no signs of distorted silhouettes or collapsed geometry, which suggests an effective adaptation of the Art Nouveau style to depict these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color gradient across the sky and ground consistent with a soft, iridescent glass effect, showing no harsh boundaries or artificial highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color gradient in Image B is indicative of a soft, iridescent glass effect. The blending of colors is seamless, with gradual transitions rather than harsh lines or abrupt changes in hue, mimicking the qualities of stained glass. This soft rendering enhances the overall aesthetic without unexpected highlights or boundaries.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the cloth display five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does it interact realistically with the fabric without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's hand holds the cloth with natural spacing and realistic curvature among the fingers. The interaction between the hand and fabric is believable, with the cloth appearing to rest naturally within the dancer's grip, showing no signs of clipping or floating. This suggests careful attention to the anatomy and physics of the scene.",
