      "question": "Does the navy blue mesh pattern on the can maintain consistent texture density and alignment without visible warping or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the navy blue mesh pattern on what appears to be a sneaker transformed into a can maintains a consistent texture density and alignment, as it is smooth and even throughout without any signs of warping or stretching. Mesh patterns on products often signify breathability and are visually represented by a grid-like arrangement, which is consistent in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the embossed lace textures evenly spaced and aligned around the can, without jagged edges or inconsistent depth that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace textures are embossed onto the surface of the can in a way that appears even and aligned. There are no jagged edges or fluctuating depths that would indicate digital artifacting. Embossing usually gives a 3D appearance to details and should have consistent spacing to avoid visual defects.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the sole of the sneaker, now represented on the lower half of the can, appear to wrap seamlessly with consistent shape and spacing. There are no signs of tearing or misalignment, indicating a clean transition despite the product transformation. Stripes on footwear are usually symmetrical and should follow the contours smoothly.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Kickstart' on Image B is prominently displayed with clear readability and is well-centered on the designated white area of the can. The font size appears adequate, and there is no shadowing or blurring that could indicate a rendering issue. Text designs on products are typically clear and precise to ensure brand visibility.",
