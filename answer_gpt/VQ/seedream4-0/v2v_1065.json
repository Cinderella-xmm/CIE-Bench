      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D figure is designed to have exaggerated, stylized features typical of chibi characters, which often includes larger heads and smaller bodies for a cute, playful appearance. Despite these artistic distortions, the figure successfully captures the dynamic action of skateboarding with correct limb placement and posture, akin to the skateboarder in Image A, though in a simplified form suitable for the stylistic approach. The pose reflects a sense of movement that is coherent within the chibi art style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and ramps are presented in a way that evokes miniatures. The trees have a consistent texture, simulating a realistic look in a small scale with no evident geometric inconsistencies. The ramps appear constructed in a manner that aligns with standard miniaturized model-making techniques, maintaining a clean form and coherent connection to the scene within the snow globe.",

      "question": "Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the character's clothing and skateboard with a simplified texture, which is appropriate for the chibi-style and the miniaturized context of the snow globe. Although the details are less refined compared to those in a real-life setting, as seen in Image A, they are well-executed within the 3D figure's context, maintaining necessary elements like color and form coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is depicted with an attention to detail that ensures structural consistency. The glass of the snow globe reflects light and shows scattering effects around the environment realistically, providing a convincing representation of how light would interact with such an object and giving an overall credible visual presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow effect inside the snow globe in Image B is crafted to mimic the falling snow that is often seen in such collectibles. The particles are suspended in various positions, enhancing the lively atmosphere without appearing static or artificially placed. The snow's dynamic scattering contributes to the whimsical and engaging scene presented within the globe.",
