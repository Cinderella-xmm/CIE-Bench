      "question": "Do the enlarged shopping bags retain their original geometric shapes without distorted edges or broken polygons?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edited shopping bags have been enlarged and feature geometric patterns. The edges and shapes of these geometric patterns appear consistent, without distortions or any evidence of broken polygons. The integrity of the shapes has been preserved during editing. Image A shows standard shopping bags with less prominent patterns, but Image B's geometric forms are distinct yet intact.",

      "question": "Is the velvety texture on the coat uniformly applied without unnatural shine or inconsistent surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the coat with a rich, velvety texture. The edited image shows a uniform appearance in terms of texture, without signs of unnatural shine or surface inconsistencies. The material in Image B maintains a consistent velvety finish across the coat, unlike possibly less pronounced textures in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glossy gloves visually consistent in shape and reflection, with no distorted finger joints or misplaced highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gloves maintain realistic outlines and consistent reflections that accurately represent their glossy material. The finger joints appear natural, and highlights are correctly placed according to light sources. The visual representation of the gloves is coherent and without distortion compared to Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the abstract retail symbols positioned around the subject without overlapping or intersecting with her body or shopping bags?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B contains abstract retail symbols positioned around the border of the image. These symbols are placed away from the subject and shopping bags, ensuring no overlapping or intersecting occurs. This placement keeps the visuals clear and unobstructed, different from Image A, which lacks these symbols.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the open panel for personal messages blend seamlessly into the background with matching lighting and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open panel intended for personal messages integrates seamlessly into the background with a matching lighting effect and consistent texture. It does not disrupt the uniformity of the background wall. Compared to Image A, where no such panel exists, Image B displays smooth integration within the visual context.",
