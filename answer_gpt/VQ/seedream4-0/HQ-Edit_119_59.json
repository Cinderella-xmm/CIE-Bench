      "question": "Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are depicted with pronounced muscle groups that are stylized but still maintain a form of anatomical plausibility. The muscles appear exaggerated but follow the typical contour and alignment of muscle groups found in a well-developed human arm. The deltoids, biceps, and triceps are outlined clearly, and they are connected in a way that reflects the underlying bone structure. Although idealized, this depiction does not violate basic anatomical proportions and joint alignment.",

      "question": "Are the gym-themed motifs on the tank top and shorts clearly rendered with consistent material properties and no overlapping or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gym-themed motifs such as dumbbells and kettlebells on the tank top are clear and distinct. The material of the clothing appears smooth and consistent, with no signs of overlapping or fragmented textures. The designs are well-integrated into the tank top, maintaining consistency across the surface area with no distortion or blending issues. Additionally, the colors and outlines of the motifs are sharp and vivid, ensuring clear visibility against the white tank top backdrop.",

      "question": "Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the barâ€™s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colorful icons on the barbell in Image B are symmetrically placed on both sides of the bar. Each side mirrors the other in terms of the icon's color palette and positioning. The icons are neatly aligned with the axis of the barbell, maintaining proportional and symmetrical distribution without distortion. There is no indication that the icons appear detached or misaligned, ensuring a coherent and orderly appearance along the bar.",

      "question": "Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows seen in the mirror are consistent with the lighting direction as indicated by the light sources in the gym environment. The shadows reflect the position and stance of the main subject accurately, showing depth and perspective that correspond with the surrounding objects and gym setting. The lighting creates consistent highlights and shadows on the body's musculature and the gym equipment seen in the mirror, supporting the overall realism and spatial coherence of the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar strip at the bottom of the panel is aligned horizontally and runs parallel to the edge, maintaining a straight and orderly appearance. The size of the calendar strip is appropriate in relation to the scale of the figure and the surrounding environment. It does not appear oversized or undersized, fitting harmoniously into the panel without being obtrusive or disproportionate.",
