      "question": "Are the textures on the 3D chibi-style characters smooth and consistent with the rest of the image, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style characters are designed with a smooth texture typical of such stylized animations. This style intentionally departs from realistic textures, favoring a uniform and polished aesthetic, which matches the visual consistency of the rest of the image. There are no visible artifacts like pixelation or jagged edges, indicating the textures are processed correctly in line with the style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the train and station backdrop maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without any distortions or unnatural alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the train and station backdrop appear structurally sound and consistent with a realistic depiction of a train station. The lines of the train tracks, building, and train itself remain straight and appropriately rendered, with no distortions noted. Comparing with Image A, both utilize straight lines and accurate perspective to maintain realism, suggesting the edited image successfully corresponds to these aspects without any distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style characters retain their original positions, outfits, and postures accurately, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style characters are placed in similar positions to those in Image A, near the station and on the platform. Their outfits reflect a simplified version of the traditional clothing seen in Image A, and their postures remain consistent, sustaining the characters' stances without any abnormal deformation. The transition merely simplifies the design, characteristic of the chibi style.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the characters' clothing and accessories preserved in the 3D chibi-style characters, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi style in Image B intentionally simplifies detail for a cartoonish representation. While this results in a loss of intricate detail seen in Image A, it is consistent with chibi design principles where simplified and minimal detail is expected. The absence of intricate textures in exchange for smooth surfaces doesn't indicate a loss of detail inappropriately but rather a stylistic choice.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the 3D chibi-style characters within the scene contribute to a visually credible and natural appearance, without disrupting the overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style characters in Image B are positioned in a way that reflects their locations in Image A. Despite their stylized nature, they integrate within the environment coherently, maintaining the scene's spatial logic and composition. The overall layout feels balanced and doesn't appear to disrupt the authenticity of the setting, portraying an engaging and credible composition.",
