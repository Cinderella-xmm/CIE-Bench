      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B retains essential details like the girl's headscarf and the pearl earring, typical indicators that make the subject recognizable.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain is depicted with a soft rubber texture, typical for chibi-styled keychains, augmented by bold black outlines that emphasize its shape. There are no unnatural textures present that would detract from this representation.",
