      "question": "Does the bag character retain its original earthy tones, leather straps, and structural design without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag character appears to have maintained its original design elements from Image A, including the earthy tones and leather straps. The shape and structural details of the bag are consistent with what is typically seen in a canvas or leather duffel bag, and there are no signs of unnatural textures or a loss of detail. The bag's familiarity and realism in terms of color and material help support the narrative without distracting from the animation's additions.",

      "question": "Has the bowl character been transformed in a way that maintains its original proportions and avoids any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl character has been illustrated with added cartoon features like eyes and limbs to give it character. Despite these additions, the original proportions such as the curvature of the bowl and its symmetry are retained. There are no alterations that result in geometric distortions, ensuring that the bowl’s character design is consistent with real-world expectations.",

      "question": "Do the expressions and actions of the bag and bowl characters in both panels feel natural and consistent with the described scenarios without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bag and bowl characters engaging in an expressive manner. The animated character design inherently includes exaggeration typical of cartoon styles, but the expressions and actions align with the illustrated adventure scenario, maintaining a natural flow. The actions appear consistent with the narrative and don’t introduce unexplained artifacts like shadows or erratic lines, making the depiction logical within its artistic bounds.",

      "question": "Have the cat-like attributes added to the bag character integrated seamlessly with the original design without disrupting the overall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cat-like character associated with holding the bag, rather than the bag itself being altered to embody cat-like attributes. The bag maintains its original structure and design. The integration of cartoonish elements has been accomplished by involving the cat in interaction with the bag, rather than altering the bag itself. Therefore, the overall structure of the bag remains unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the positioning and movement of the bowl character in Panel 2 physically logical and maintains the integrity of the scene without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bowl character depicted with animated movement. The positioning and rolling motion align with the concept of a round object capable of rolling on a flat surface. While cartoon exaggeration allows for certain liberties, the depiction maintains the physical logic of how a bowl with added cartoon limbs might move or interact with the environment, without introducing inexplicable artifacts.",
