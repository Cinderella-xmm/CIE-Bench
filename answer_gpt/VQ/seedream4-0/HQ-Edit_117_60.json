      "question": "Are the sails rendered as smooth, polished walnut with visible and consistent grain patterns that mimic real wood, without artificial sheen or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails appear to be crafted from smooth, polished walnut, showcasing a grain pattern that aligns with what is expected from real wood. The texture on the sails is consistent and naturally resembles wood grain, without any signs of artificial sheen or repetitive patterns that are often seen in synthetic or poorly rendered textures. This indicates careful attention to maintaining the authentic appearance of wooden material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hull display deep, textured carvings that resemble individual walnut planks with natural variations in thickness and spacing, preserving the original boat’s silhouette without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull exhibits deeply textured carvings that resemble authentic walnut with detailed craftsmanship. The variations in thickness and spacing of the carvings are indicative of real woodwork, and these elements contribute to maintaining the integrity of the boat’s silhouette without noticeable distortion. This suggests a high degree of artistry in rendering the texture of the wood.",

      "question": "Is the boat positioned on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that is properly grounded and aligned with the boat’s base, without appearing to float or disconnect from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the boat positioned on a pedestal that is sleek, pale beige in color, and appears properly grounded. The alignment between the boat’s base and the pedestal is consistent, giving the effect of stable positioning without signs of floating or disconnection. This setup demonstrates proper compositional alignment and depth perception in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wood tones across the sails and hull show natural variation in color and reflectivity under the ambient light, without uniformity or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the wood tones across the sails and hull exhibit a natural variation in color. The reflectivity responds to ambient light in a manner consistent with real wood, showing subtle changes in tone and shine rather than uniform color or unnatural highlights. This variety helps in creating a realistic portrayal of wooden surfaces under varied lighting conditions.",

      "question": "Are all structural elements such as the mast, rigging, and deck preserved in correct alignment and proportion relative to each other, without stretching, bending, or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B preserves the structural elements like the mast, rigging, and deck in accurate alignment and proportion with respect to each other. There is no evidence of stretching, bending, or omitted components, which showcases attention to detail and technical accuracy in maintaining the boat’s structural integrity.",
