      "question": "Does the added poem text blend naturally with the image without causing any visible distortion to the background or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the added poem text is positioned below the bird and overlays the branch area. The text does not appear to obscure or distort the bird or the background, as the elements remain crisp and well-defined. The integrity of the image's primary focus, the bird, is preserved. Thus, the text blends well without introducing distortion to the crucial aspects of the image.",

      "question": "Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the poem text is placed at the bottom of the frame, overlapping slightly with the branch but not the bird. The text is thoughtfully positioned so that key elements like the bird remain unobstructed, maintaining the structural consistency of the original composition.",

      "question": "Is the font and size of the added poem text appropriate, maintaining readability while not overpowering the natural elements of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s text is in a clear font and size, ensuring legibility. The text is placed in white font contrasting against the darker background, making it readable without being overly dominant. It nicely supplements the image without detracting from the natural subject—the bird.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is smoothly integrated with a brightness suitable for the illuminated background, aligning well with the lighting conditions. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural contrasts between the text and the image, indicating a smooth textual addition.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition maintains its natural harmony, with the text added subtly and positioned so that it complements rather than disrupts the original elements. The image retains its original feel with the bird as the focal point, and the text enhances rather than interferes with the visual experience.",
