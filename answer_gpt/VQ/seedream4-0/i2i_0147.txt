    "Question": "Q1: Does the melted cheese appear with a natural texture and color, without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the melted cheese is visually identifiable by its yellow-orange color and slightly glossy texture, which is consistent with how melted cheese typically looks. The positioning on the sausage also appears appropriate, adhering naturally to the surface without any odd protrusions or visible artifacts that would suggest manipulation. The color fits well within the expected hue for melted cheese under warm lighting, like that from a grill, thus appearing natural.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the fried onions positioned naturally on the hot dog, avoiding any distortion or breakage of geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the fried onions retain a natural look, curved and layered in a way that is consistent with how they would rest on a hot dog. Their shapes appear intact without noticeable distortion or unnatural alterations.
