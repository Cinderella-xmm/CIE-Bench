    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the cylindrical shape of a container is depicted, consistent with a tall cylindrical tea box rather than a teapot. The surface looks smooth and continuous, adhering to the definition of a cylindrical form without visible distortions or irregularities. The visual cues of symmetry and consistent cylindrical proportions confirm this evaluation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the golden foil floral patterns clearly embossed with consistent depth, proper lighting interaction, and no signs of blurred edges or artificial textures?",
    "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows golden foil patterns, but the clarity and depth of embossing seem variable. While there is a perception of lighting interaction, edges show some indistinctness and the material appears somewhat artificial and lacks texture details, which suggests inconsistency in embossing depth and lighting interaction.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the redesigned cups stacked in a stable, physically plausible manner with matching rim sizes and lids that fit securely without gaps or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The cups in Image B are stacked vertically, and each cup seems to have a matching size for the rims, supporting a stable and plausible stacking arrangement. The lids appear to fit well without gaps or misalignment evident in the clear presentation of the stacked form. This follows an understanding of physical balance and structural integrity in stacking objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the Japanese calligraphy positioned at the top of the packaging with natural brushstroke variation and clear legibility, without clipping or distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the calligraphy atop the packaging is assessed. The positioning is centered and legible, showing brushstroke variation typically indicative of hand-drawn calligraphy, which supports clarity and natural form without distortion or clipping.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
    "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the bamboo motif is depicted with consistent spacing and smoothness, suggesting design continuity. The grain texture appears uniform and free from evident distortions, maintaining naturalistic representation without repeating patterns within visible parameters.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the tea set is visibly flat and uniformly white, reflecting no unintended shadows, textures, or reflections which would otherwise disrupt the seamless presentation typical for such display setups.",
    "answer": "Yes"
