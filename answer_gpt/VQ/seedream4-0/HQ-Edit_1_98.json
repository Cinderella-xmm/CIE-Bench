      "question": "Does the floral engraving on the dress appear seamlessly integrated into the fabric without visible texture breaks, misaligned patterns, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral engraving on the dress appears to be part of the fabric and follows the natural flow and curves of the dress. The floral design does not seem to have any noticeable misalignments or interruptions in its pattern, and there are no unnatural highlights that would suggest the pattern is an overlay. This seamless integration indicates a well-executed application of the design on the fabric.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sepia tones applied uniformly across all elements (including skin, dress, violin, window frame, and plants) without localized color distortions or loss of detail in shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia tones in Image B give it a vintage look, and they seem to be applied consistently. All elements, including the skin, dress, violin, window frame, and plants, share the same sepia wash, enhancing the uniformity of the image. There are no apparent areas where the colors look distorted, and the detail in shadows and highlights is preserved, which indicates that the sepia effect is well-executed across the entire image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the abstract swirls in the window view remain confined within the window panes and align correctly with their borders, without overlapping into the room or distorting the window structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstract swirls visible through the window panes are confined within the borders of the window. These swirls do not extend into the room, nor do they disrupt the alignment or structure of the window frame. This effective containment ensures that the artistic elements outside the window do not interfere with the interior scene.",

      "question": "Are the gold inlays on the violin positioned along logical contours of the instrument and do they exhibit consistent metallic sheen and reflection without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold inlays on the violin in Image B appear to follow the natural contours of the instrument, enhancing its aesthetic. These inlays exhibit a consistent sheen that reflects light in a way characteristic of metallic surfaces, helping them appear naturally integrated into the violin without looking detached or misaligned.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the handwritten music score border evenly spaced, legible, and aligned along the image edge without intersecting or obscuring any part of the violinist, window, or foreground objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten music score borders Image B effectively, as it is spaced evenly along the edges of the image. The text is legible and does not intersect with or cover key elements like the violinist, window, or any objects in the room. This careful placement ensures that the border complements rather than distracts from the central subjects of the image.",
