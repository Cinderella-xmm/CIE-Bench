      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the peaks are transformed into a creature resembling a giant buffalo. The overall integrity of the peaks has changed significantly; they no longer exhibit mountain-like features but rather appear as the body and head of this creature. Compared to Image A, where the peaks are clearly defined as mountains with extreme height and angularity, Image B's transformation means that the peaks do not retain these characteristics. The creature seems more compact and less angular than the geological formations. Thus, the peaks do not retain their original height and angularity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's hide is textured to mimic natural rock formations, with variations in roughness akin to geological patterns. The hide appears irregular and resembles an organic rocky surface similar to mountain textures. There are no evident tile-like patterns or sharp edges that would suggest digital artifacts. Image A shows naturally occurring rock formations, which have inherently irregular and non-repeating patterns, now reflected in the creature's hide of Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy patches and root-like strands on the creature give the impression of extending seamlessly from its rocky hide, similar to how moss grows on mountain surfaces. These elements appear to be anchored to the surface and follow the contours of the transformed figure, rather than floating or clustering unnaturally. In Image A, this kind of continuity from existing vegetation zones follows the natural gradient of the slopes, consistent with Image B's portrayal, ensuring cohesion with the landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's structure includes sinewy elements as part of its design, but these do not seem placed within the valley or follow its natural curve. The transformation turns these parts into organic musculature that does not mimic the valley area's depression or smoothly connect to slopes as in Image A. Here the valley has a clear gradient connecting smoothly with adjacent mountain slopes. Image B diverges from this, focusing more on the creature's anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the creature's hide and furs are closely aligned with the tones of the original landscape, maintaining a cohesive ambiance. The rocky textures, earthy fur colors, and moss patches fall within the same palette observed in Image A, contributing to harmonious visual coherence. There are no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt the terrain's natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, details on the creature such as its hide's texture mimic erosion patterns similar to those on mountain slopes, having rocky crevices and irregularities suggestive of natural formations. These details are transformed from the mountain textures shown in Image A and match them in complexity. While transformed, they maintain a level of alignment with the concept of terrain in their depiction, but given the transformation, the alignment with actual terrain features may not be precisely accurate.",
