        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's body proportions and posture are consistent with typical soft vinyl figures, maintaining a balanced and visually credible posture.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's suit maintains its detailed textures, with visible seams, gloss, and matte finishes that mimic material realism typical for soft vinyl figures.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the accessories like weapons and hand gestures are well-arranged around the figure, designed to integrate with the figureâ€™s form.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
