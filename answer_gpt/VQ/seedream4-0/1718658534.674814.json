      "question": "Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine has a glossy finish that is typical of ceramic materials. The surface is shiny and smooth, lacking any knit texture that would be present in fabric or yarn. The sheen is even across the entire figurine, indicative of polished ceramics. This is consistent with the characteristics of ceramics and shows no signs of the previous knit texture seen in fabric-based items.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral engravings on the figurine in Image B are clearly defined and proportionally scaled.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are amber-colored, smooth, and polished, reflecting light appropriately which adds a sense of depth and realism.

      "question": "Is the figurine resting flat on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and natural shadowing beneath it, indicating proper physical support and spatial coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is shown resting on a wooden surface, and the wood grain is clearly visible. Natural shadowing is present beneath the figurine, which indicates proper support and spatial coherence with the scene. The shadows enhance the three-dimensional perception, confirming that it is physically grounded and consistent with the environment.",
