      "question": "Are the abstract geometric patterns on the man's robe seamlessly integrated into the fabric without introducing visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe of the man has been stylized with abstract geometric patterns. By analyzing these patterns, we can see that they are smoothly blended into the fabric. The design does not exhibit any jagged edges or mismatches in texture or unnatural shifts in color, suggesting a seamless integration. The patterns are consistent with the flow of the cloth, which supports the conclusion that the integration was done skillfully.\n",

      "question": "Do the transformed lamp bases retain recognizable brass-like material properties and maintain proportional geometry consistent with their original structure when stylized as corner flourishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp bases from the original scene have been stylized to appear as corner flourishes. The flourishes retain a metallic, brass-like appearance which is seen in the color and shine consistent with brass materials. Additionally, the proportions and shapes reflected in the flourishes are reminiscent of the original bases, indicating that the stylizing process maintained the integrity of the original structures.\n",

      "question": "Is the extended portion of the bookcase visually continuous with the original section, showing consistent shelf spacing, book alignment, and lighting without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookcase has been extended upwards with ornate design elements in that area. The shelves and books in this extension align well with those in the original, maintaining consistent spacing and alignment. The lighting appears uniform across the bookcase, with no visible seams or distortions disrupting the visual flow. This continuity maintains a coherent aesthetic between the original and the added section.\n",

      "question": "Are the script elements embedded within the bookcase surface rendered with appropriate transparency and scale so they do not obscure books or create unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the stylized version, there are script elements displayed in the background of the bookcase. These appear faint and appropriately scaled so they do not overshadow the books or cause any unnatural visual effects. The transparency is managed so that the books remain visually prioritized, and the script elements do not create confusion or unwanted layering.\n",

      "question": "Does the area intended for inspirational quotes display a clean, unobstructed region with consistent lighting and texture that allows for future text placement without visual disruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The region intended for inspirational quotes in Image B is set on the desk in the foreground. This area is left unobstructed with a uniform texture and lighting that provides a blank space suitable for text placement. The clean surface indicates preparedness for adding quotes without causing disruption or clashing with the image background.\n",
