      "question": "Are Mona Lisa's facial features, such as her eyes, nose, mouth, and smile, rendered naturally without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Mona Lisa is transformed into a Studio Ghibli art style, which may affect the natural rendering of her facial features. The Ghibli style typically has simplified and exaggerated features. This transformation usually results in different artistic liberties, departing from the highly detailed and nuanced expression of Leonardo da Vinci's original painting. While the face is blurred and cannot be assessed, given the art style change, it is likely that artifacts were introduced due to this transformation.",

      "question": "Does the color adaptation around Mona Lisa preserve structural coherence and avoid unnatural color blending or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image adopts a Studio Ghibli style characterized by soft colors and harmonious blending. This style generally avoids harsh edges and maintains visual coherence by ensuring that colors transition smoothly. Comparing this to traditional oil painting techniques in the original image that employ smooth transitions, the edited image successfully adopts a style that aligns with its artistic intent in maintaining structural coherence.",

      "question": "Does the edited background in Studio Ghibli style retain its visual plausibility and avoid breaking the geometric shapes seen in the original painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image's background transforms the landscape into a more vibrant and stylized version typical of Studio Ghibli works. While it diverges from the precise geometric shapes captured in the original painting's landscape, it maintains visual plausibility within its new stylistic context. The edges are well-defined, and the overall composition remains coherent.",

      "question": "Are the textures and folds of Mona Lisa's dress depicted in a way that avoids unnatural patterns and maintains a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the dress is simplified into the smooth, flowing lines of animation, which fits the Studio Ghibli style. While this differs from the intricate detailing and texture depicted in the original painting, the edited image maintains a realistic appearance relative to its stylized context. The folds and patterns are consistent with Ghibli's animation norms, thus avoiding unnatural patterns within this style.",

      "question": "Do Mona Lisa's hands in the Studio Ghibli style maintain a natural appearance with correct finger count and ergonomic positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, Mona Lisa's hands maintain the natural positioning similar to the original, with correct finger count and an ergonomic placement consistent with the natural resting position. The Ghibli style applies simplified detailing but retains the essence of natural hand anatomy and positioning.",
