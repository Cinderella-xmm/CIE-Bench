      "question": "Does the character's transformation into an anime-style action figure maintain natural textures and fine details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character within the box is depicted as an anime-style action figure. To determine if the textures and details are natural, we observe the vibrant colors, exaggerated features typical of anime figures, and the absence of pixelation or blurring around the edges. Such features are consistent with high-quality action figures, which aim to replicate the aesthetic of anime while providing a tangible physical form. Therefore, the textures and details are natural within the context of an anime-style action figure.",

      "question": "Does the box design seamlessly integrate with the rest of the image, maintaining visual credibility without disrupting the overall scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box containing the action figure is juxtaposed against a backdrop typical of an airplane setting. The color scheme and shadows align with the lighting and ambiance of the background. Additionally, it fits proportionally within the scene, maintaining the illusion that it rests upon the airplane’s wing. These aspects help maintain the visual credibility and seamless integration of the box within the overall image, making it appear as part of the scene rather than an outlier.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the airplane-related elements incorporated into the box design proportionally correct and physically rational, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B includes airplane-themed elements, such as a small propeller plane that fits within the packaging. These elements are designed to mimic toy models, where maintaining some degree of proportion and shape adds to their believability as replicas of real airplanes. Given that toy models typically exaggerate certain features for visual appeal, the presence of a small propeller plane with consistent design characteristics supports proportional correctness without evident distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character's dynamic pose atop the small airplane wing appear structurally consistent and visually credible, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is dynamically posed on a small propeller plane within the box. The figure's pose captures motion, which is typical of action figures aiming to convey excitement and energy. The limbs and body align realistically with the aircraft’s wing, showing no sign of bending or deformation that seems unnatural. The balanced and proportionate stance against the wing supports a structurally consistent and visually credible depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the hyper-realistic figure beside the box rendered realistically and naturally, resembling a professionally photographed product?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure outside the box in Image B is depicted with a high level of detail, focusing on clothing texture, body posture, and finishing that is akin to professional figurine photography. The rendering shows clear, smooth lines and well-defined textures without the presence of extraneous artifacts. This accurate representation of textures and materials reflects what is standard in product photography, enhancing the figure's realism and professional appearance.",
