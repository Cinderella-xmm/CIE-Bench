      "question": "Do the petal-like wing structures appear translucent with smooth gradients and no jagged edges or unnatural pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing structures of the butterfly are crafted to simulate a translucent material, akin to fairy wings. The gradient on these wings, transitioning smoothly from one part to another, is consistent and vivid, indicating a lack of pixelation. This suggests a high-quality rendering without any jagged edges, contributing to the delicate and ethereal appearance of the wings.",

      "question": "Are the golden tendrils smoothly attached to the head, with consistent metallic sheen and visible sparkle effects that do not distort the surrounding area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tendrils in Image B are affixed to the butterfly's head in a natural manner. The consistent gold metallic sheen and sparkles enhance their elegance without causing any visible distortion in the adjacent areas. This indicates a careful and realistic design application, upholding the overall aesthetic of the image.",

      "question": "Does the floral texture on the butterfly’s body follow the natural contours without warping or breaking the underlying shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the butterfly exhibits a floral texture that adheres to its contours seamlessly. The intricate details of the flowers blend smoothly along the butterfly's form, maintaining its shape without any visible warping or disruption. This careful integration highlights the attention to realistic detail in the compositional process.",

      "question": "Are the sapphire orb eyes symmetrically positioned and emitting a soft glow without bleeding into the head or causing halo artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the butterfly’s eyes as sapphire orbs, with symmetrical positioning enhancing their natural look. They emit a subtle glow confined to their area without bleeding into the surrounding head area or creating undesirable halo effects. This precise execution displays a balanced and harmonious design element.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the starry trail aligned with the butterfly’s position and orientation, with gradual fading and no abrupt edges or floating particles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The starry trail in Image B is skillfully aligned to follow the butterfly’s path and orientation. The trail begins robustly and gently fades, providing a natural progression without abrupt disruptions or misplaced particles, which implies deliberate and coherent editing to suit the overall setting.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the floating blooms positioned at plausible distances from the ground and integrated with the lighting gradient without casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blooms appear to be scattered realistically at varying distances, each lit in harmony with the environment’s lighting. There are no shadows that seem incongruent, indicating well-considered placement and integration with the ambient light, creating a believable and enchanting scene.",
