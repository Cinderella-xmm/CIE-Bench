      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D characters retain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortions in their facial features and body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D characters have simplified and exaggerated features typical of chibi proportions, such as larger heads and smaller bodies compared to realistic human proportions. Despite these stylized features, the proportions appear consistent, harmonious, and intentional, without awkward distortions. Chibi aesthetics are characterized by these playful proportions, ensuring the characters remain visually appealing. Therefore, within the context of chibi design, they retain 'natural' proportions. Image A shows real people, whose proportions follow human anatomy, contrasting with chibi design principles. Thus, the characters are naturally proportional within the chibi context.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe, including its base and the table it rests on, integrate naturally with the living room setting without visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a snow globe set on a table in a warm living room environment. The integration appears seamless; the snow globe's base and table match the surrounding decor in color and style. The lighting casts realistic reflections and shadows around the globe, enhancing its presence in the room. There are no visible glitches or discrepancies that suggest it doesn't belong in the scene. In Image A, a group of people plays video games without such objects. The snow globe setting in Image B harmonizes well with its background, showing careful attention to integration.",

      "question": "Are the miniature snowflakes and twinkling fairy lights inside the snow globe visually credible and free from unnatural textures or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes and fairy lights inside Image B's snow globe are designed to convey a magical, decorative effect. The snowflakes vary in size and distribution, mimicking real snowfall captured inside a globe. The fairy lights twinkle softly without stark shadows, adding a festive, cozy atmosphere and blending naturally with the foreground and background decor. There are no signs of harsh lighting or texture issues that disrupt visual believability. Image A lacks these elements, as it captures a real-life scenario. In Image B, the internal aspects of the snow globe are aesthetically and technically consistent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the game controllers are depicted with a straightforward design that aligns with chibi art styles, characterized by simplicity and a cartoonish, exaggerated scale. Despite the stylized depiction, the controllers retain recognizable elements—buttons, handles, and overall form—suggesting functionality within the visual narrative. The controllers maintain structural integrity and are consistent with the chibi theme. Image A shows real-life game controllers which any game enthusiast can recognize. Therefore, the chibi controllers retain original characteristics that make them recognizable and functional.",
