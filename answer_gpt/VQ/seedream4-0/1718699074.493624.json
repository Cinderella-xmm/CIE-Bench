    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts luminous panels that seamlessly cover the surface, shaped to fit the structure without any visible gaps or overlapping seams. The panels appear to be carefully integrated into the form of the structure, suggesting precision in alignment based on the visual cues.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital panels display bright neon animations with sharp lines and continuous patterns. There are no indications of pixelation or fragmentation, as the luminous designs are clear and coherent, combining world knowledge of high-quality digital displays seen on screens.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows synthetic foliage around the pedestal that emits a soft, even glow. The plants have defined shapes and visible depth, indicating realistic structure rather than appearing as flat decals, consistent with the appearance of well-rendered 3D objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic surfaces in Image B reflect light accurately, with subtle variations ensuring realistic appearances. They do not exhibit distorted grid patterns or stretched textures, indicating a sophisticated rendering consistent with real-world metallic surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates that the transformed head and pedestal are aligned consistently with the horizon and surrounding buildings, with no observable angular distortions or mismatches in perspective, fitting well into the overall scene and maintaining continuity.",
