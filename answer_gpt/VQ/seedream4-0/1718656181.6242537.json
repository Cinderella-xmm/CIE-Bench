    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cloud formations above the explosion composed of distinct geometric shapes that follow the overall contour of the mushroom cloud without disrupting its volumetric form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cloud formations in the explosion are stylized with distinct geometric shapes and bold outlines, adhering to the overall contour of the mushroom cloud. This approach maintains the volumetric perception of the cloud, consistent with the pop art style, where shapes and colors are often exaggerated and simplified.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the neon-colored elements in the explosion maintain consistent brightness and contrast relative to the surrounding sky and water, avoiding abrupt or physically implausible luminance shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon-colored elements of the explosion are consistent with the palette used throughout the artwork. The brightness and contrast are intentionally heightened to create a vivid pop art effect, yet these are harmoniously integrated with the surrounding sky and water, avoiding any abrupt luminance shifts that would seem out of place within the context of the artwork's style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the palm trees depicted with thick black outlines and simplified shapes, positioned correctly along the beach wall without overlapping or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees are illustrated using thick black outlines and simplified, stylized shapes typical of pop art. They are properly positioned along the edge of the beach wall, maintaining alignment and avoiding any overlap or misaligned edges, which supports the clean, graphic nature of the art style.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the island’s terrain been reduced to abstract geometric shapes that maintain correct spatial relationships with the sea and horizon, without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the island’s terrain is depicted using abstract geometric shapes, which is a hallmark of pop art style. These shapes maintain a coherent interaction with the rest of the scene, correctly aligning with the sea and horizon. There are no sections that appear to be floating or disconnected, ensuring a unified composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sky and water rendered with flat colors and clean outlines, matching the pop art style, without visible texture degradation or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the sky and water are rendered using flat, bold colors and clean outlines, which is characteristic of pop art. The textures are smooth with no degradation, and the lighting effects are consistent with the stylized approach of the artwork, ensuring there are no mismatches that would disrupt the visual consistency.",
