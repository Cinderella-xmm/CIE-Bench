      "question": "Does the book animation on the clock face align perfectly with the curved top and vertical frame of the clock, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book appears to be placed on top of the clock with its animated display. However, the alignment with the curved top and the vertical frame of the clock seems slightly off. The book's design integrates interesting elements but does not perfectly follow the contours of the clock's design, with parts where the proportions deviate, suggesting a lack of smooth transition between the materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the text snippets embedded in the wallpaper clearly legible, evenly spaced, and seamlessly blended into the background pattern without creating unnatural shadows or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text snippets added to the wallpaper in Image B appear to be embedded with an attempt to merge with the floral design background, but they are not clearly legible. The spacing seems uneven, and there are minor issues with blending that create slight unnatural shadows or color disparities, which detract from seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image of the ancient sundial inside the framed artwork properly scaled, centered, and rendered with consistent lighting and depth relative to the original frame and surrounding wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, where the ancient sundial image is placed inside the framed artwork, it appears to be largely scaled correctly and centered. The lighting is consistent with the rest of the room, maintaining depth relative to the surrounding frame and wall. This indicates a good integration of the sundial image into the frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the pen-shaped clock hands appear structurally sound, properly aligned with the book’s cover, and free from distortion such as bent metal parts or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pen-shaped clock hands added to the book’s cover in Image B maintain a structure that appears robust and properly aligned with the cover's design. There are no visible issues with distortion like bent metal parts or mismatched shadows that would disrupt their cohesion with the book's cover, suggesting a well-executed integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the captions placed in the room clearly readable, stylistically consistent with art-nouveau design, and physically integrated into their respective surfaces without overlapping or distorting underlying materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The captions placed in Image B around the room are in a decorative style, yet they are difficult to read clearly. While some effort is made to align them with an art-nouveau design aesthetic, they often overlap with the underlying materials, leading to some distortion and lack of physical integration, which diminishes their overall clarity and stylistic consistency.",
