      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt consists of distinct LEGO-sized square blocks, which showcase the characteristic grid lines found on LEGO bricks. The surface appears to have a matte finish typical of plastic LEGO pieces, and lacks fabric-like qualities such as folds or stitching. These elements are consistent with the appearance and texture of LEGO bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The round sports elements on the quilt in Image B are clearly depicted as circular LEGO tiles. These tiles are uniformly sized and aligned perfectly within the square grid of LEGO bricks, maintaining their intended shape without any signs of stretching or deformation, which is characteristic of LEGO construction.",

      "question": "Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillow is replaced by a cube made entirely from LEGO bricks. This cube has equal dimensions on all sides and right angles, consistent with the standardized shape of LEGO bricks. The construction is seamless with no visible gaps or misalignments, showcasing a typical LEGO brick structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bed base in Image B is crafted to resemble a standard LEGO baseplate, characterized by a flat, white, seamless surface. It does not exhibit any visible wood grain or shadows and lacks depth cues, suggesting a consistent LEGO construction finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is completely absent of any physical room elements such as walls, furniture, or windows. It is entirely covered by a smooth, uniform white surface without any shadows or lighting gradients, creating the effect of a non-existent physical space, typical of a digitally rendered or abstract scene.",
