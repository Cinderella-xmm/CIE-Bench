        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in Image B are vividly colored in a consistent lime-green shade, similar to the soccer cleat and tennis ball from Image A.

      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls coherent and free from any distorted or broken geometric forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shapes of the nesting dolls in Image B are smoothly rounded with balanced proportions, typical of traditional matryoshka dolls. Each doll appears symmetrical and aligned, with no signs of distortion, breakage, or irregularities in their geometric forms. This harmonious shape supports their intended design as chibi-style dolls.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls on the sophisticated wooden table appear natural and visually plausible without any obvious misalignment or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are arranged on the wooden table in a manner that appears stable and grounded. There is no indication of floating or misalignment; the base of each doll is in contact with the table surface naturally. The positioning suggests a cohesive scene where the objects are anchored appropriately.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls arranged from largest to smallest in a manner that appears structurally consistent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nesting dolls in Image B are arranged from largest to smallest, adhering to the traditional arrangement of matryoshka dolls. This structurally consistent decrease in size across the lineup strengthens visual credibility, as each subsequent doll is appropriately smaller than the one preceding it, creating a visually logical sequence.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the texture of the sophisticated wooden table and the subtle background complement the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden table in Image B features a polished surface with visible grain, typical of a sophisticated finish, and balances well with the smooth texture of the dolls. The background is subtle, without distracting patterns or textures, maintaining the focus on the dolls. There are no unnatural textures added, and fine details in both the table and background are well-preserved, complementing the nesting dolls.",
