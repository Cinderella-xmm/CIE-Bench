    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a continuous, symmetrical egg-like shape with no visible breaks, jagged edges, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object takes the shape of an egg which is smoothly symmetrical. The visual cues indicate a continuous form with no visible breaks or jagged edges that could otherwise disrupt its egg-like symmetry. The contour appears well-defined and cohesive across its circumference. From this observation, we can conclude that the egg shape is correctly maintained.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feather-like patterns seamlessly integrated into the surface, with consistent line thickness, shading, and color gradients matching the original level of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents intricate feather-like patterns that integrate seamlessly into the egg's surface. The lines appear uniform in thickness, contributing to a cohesive texture across the object. The shading and color gradients maintain consistency, reflecting detailed craftsmanship similar to traditional decorative artwork. These observations suggest the feather patterns are well-integrated with sufficient attention to visual detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wing-shaped handle smoothly connected to the body of the egg, with realistic feather layers and no visible gaps or distortions in its curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing-shaped handle attaches to the egg body in a manner that appears smooth and natural. The visual cues show realistic feather layers with appropriate shading and texture, enhancing the detail and craftsmanship. There are no visible gaps or distortions along the handle's curvature. Through this analysis, it is evident that the handle connects seamlessly to the egg body.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the nest-like rim have a layered, organic structure with consistent material texture and properly placed jewel accents that do not appear displaced or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the nest-like rim with a layered organic structure. The texture of the nest corresponds well to natural materials, rich in detail, and the jewel accents are placed in a manner that appears deliberate and integrated into the design. None of the jewels seem displaced or floating, suggesting cohesion and attentiveness in the arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing embers produce a subtle luminous effect that enhances the patterns without causing blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights on adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing embers emanate a soft luminous effect that enriches the surrounding patterns without disrupting their clarity. There is no observable blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights in the adjacent areas, indicating the embers are well-rendered to provide an aesthetically pleasing enhancement to the artwork.",
