      "question": "Do the golden highlights on the grape clusters follow the natural curvature and lighting direction of the grapes without appearing as separate, overlaid patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the golden highlights on the grapes are designed to follow the curvature and the lighting direction, creating a realistic interaction with the shape and shadows of the grapes. This integrated appearance suggests that the highlights are part of the grapes rather than separate, overlaid elements. There is no visual indication of abrupt separations or mismatches between the highlights and the grapes.",
