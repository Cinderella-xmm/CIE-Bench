      "question": "Are the mushroom-shaped rooftops proportionally scaled to the buildings and do they display smooth, continuous surfaces without visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mushroom-shaped rooftops are consistently proportioned to the size of the buildings beneath them, enhancing the whimsical aesthetic. Each rooftop exhibits a smooth, seamless geometry without interruptions or disjointed surfaces, aligning with expected architectural models in a fantasy setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mountain structures resemble large, intertwined roots with natural branching patterns, and do they maintain smooth transitions from base to tip without abrupt geometric breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountain structures in Image B visually resemble large roots that naturally intertwine and branch, consistent with imaginative landscapes. Smooth and natural transitions from the base to the tip are evident, avoiding abrupt breaks or shifts, ensuring a harmonious feel throughout the structure.",

      "question": "Are the vines connecting the buildings uniformly textured, properly anchored at both ends, and free of floating segments or unnatural bends that violate plant growth logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines exhibit uniform texture and are accurately anchored at their endpoints to maintain realism. The vines have logical trajectories, showing no signs of floating segments or bends that contradict natural plant growth patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bridges between buildings have smooth, glowing surfaces with no visible polygonal edges, and are they positioned so that they logically span between architectural supports without floating disconnectedly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridges in Image B offer a transparent, glowing aesthetic, consistent with fantasy imagery, without evident polygonal edges. Each bridge is strategically positioned, connecting architectural supports logically without appearing disconnected or misplaced.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf-shaped airship in Image B showcases organic, vein-like texturing, consistent with natural forms found in foliage. It hovers at an appropriate height above the visual plane, aligning with size expectations. The clouds beneath are rendered in soft pastel colors, creating a gentle atmosphere without harsh outlines.",
