    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the glass bottle positioned such that its base aligns with the original location of the rose petals and does not appear disproportionately large or small compared to surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass bottle is centered in the image with its base firmly seated on the surface. The design and pattern of rose petals etched on the bottle are proportionate and appear as intended. There are no exaggerated or disproportionate elements relative to other objects in the frame, indicating that the positioning is natural and appropriate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the petal etchings on the bottle surface continuous and evenly spaced, without visible gaps, pixelation, or irregular line breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The etched petal designs on the bottle surface are clear and detailed. The spacing between them is consistent, with no evident gaps or breaks in the linework. This suggests careful attention to design, with no distortions or pixelation affecting the appearance of the etchings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the gold rose-shaped cap exhibit realistic reflections and specular highlights that match the light source direction and do not appear overly shiny or uniformly colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rose-shaped cap shows a well-executed representation of metallic surface qualities, featuring highlights and reflections consistent with a concentrated light source above. The light is subtly distributed, creating a realistic metallic sheen without appearing artificial or excessively shiny.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient inside the bottle transitions smoothly from a deeper to a lighter crimson. The color blending is continuous and consistent, showing no abrupt changes, demarcation lines, or banding, which creates an aesthetically pleasing effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vertical gold logo clearly legible, evenly spaced, and aligned along the side of the bottle without warping, fading, or overlapping with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vertical gold logo on the bottle appears sharp and clear. It is properly aligned, ensuring readability. The spacing of the letters is uniform, with no signs of warping, fading, or intersection with other visual elements of the bottle, maintaining a clear visual communication.",
