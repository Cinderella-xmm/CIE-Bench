      "question": "Does the checkmark pathway appear naturally tangled without breaking its geometric integrity or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the checkmark pathway is visually evaluated for its structural consistency and any unnatural alterations. The added elements, such as stamps and red tape, interfere with the pathway's natural geometric flow, causing visual clutter and disrupting its original integrity. Based on this analysis, the geometric integrity of the pathway is compromised by introduced artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the overlapping stamps on the 'We verify your Document' icon visually coherent and free from unnatural textures or excessive clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'We verify your Document' icon contains stamps that overlap, generally indicating a sign of document verification. However, the overlap creates a visually cluttered look with unnatural textures due to the congestion of elements. These additions obscure the original simplicity, thereby affecting visual coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the red tape motif blend naturally into the orange circular step markers without causing visual disruption or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red tape motif is observed interacting with the orange circular step markers. The presence of the red tape introduces significant visual disruption, obscuring parts of the markers and affecting the clarity and continuity of the design. This causes a loss of detail and a clash with the originally clean design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the icons and text within the orange circular step markers still legible and structurally consistent after the addition of the red tape motif?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The icons and text within the orange circular step markers in Image B are partially obscured by the red tape motif. This interference affects legibility and consistency, as the tape covers critical parts of the markers, making it difficult to perceive the information clearly.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the infographic maintained its clarity and sharpness without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of Image B, it becomes evident that the added elements like red tape and overlapping stamps have introduced unnatural textures and visual noise. This addition reduces the overall clarity and sharpness of the infographic compared to its original state. The introduction of these elements disrupts the fine details and overall clarity of the image.",
