      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kernel dressed in autumn attire is significantly larger and stylized compared to real corn kernels, which are usually small and fairly uniform in texture and size. The attire itself, while integrated well in terms of theme, stands out due to its cartoonish style and doesn't match the realistic texture of real kernels. The visual indications suggest it's more symbolic than realistic, which might create visible edges or mismatches when compared to actual corn kernels.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents energy lines in a stylized cartoon manner, indicating motion and excitement. These lines smoothly follow the directional flow away from the popcorn without intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes. They enhance the motion without causing visual discrepancies in the popcorn piece shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The popcorn piece with the explorer hat is scaled to be large enough for the hat to be visible and recognizable, maintaining a cartoonish detail consistent with other elements. The adjacent pumpkin and spice elements are positioned naturally, complementing the theme without overlapping or showing signs of distortion. The arrangement follows a coherent layout that respects the individual boundaries of each element.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the popcorn pieces visually show a trajectory consistent with gravity, falling downward into the bowls. The placement is within the bowl boundaries and doesnâ€™t visually indicate any unnatural floating or clipping through the rims, which suggests adherence to a realistic depiction of motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases added elements with colors harmonizing with the existing palette, consisting mainly of warm orange and brown tones. The hats, energy lines, and spices maintain this theme well, and there is no apparent over-saturation or bleeding at the edges. The colors are vivid but appropriately balanced to fit within the overall design style and theme.",
