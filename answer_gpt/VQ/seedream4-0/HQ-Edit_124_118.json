      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a waterfall that appears integrated within a virtual environment. The smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction suggest advanced digital rendering techniques. There is no visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes, indicating high-quality visual representation. Observing digital settings, such as reflections and holographic elements, supports this conclusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the tree trunks and vines have been digitally manipulated to exhibit fiber-optic-like qualities, creating an iridescent effect. The strands follow the natural contours of branches and visually appear smooth and consistent without patchy glow patterns. This harmonizes with the theme of advanced digital projection seen throughout the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine formations appear continuous and flow naturally along structures, creating loops that are self-supporting. There are no disconnected segments or bends that defy geometric logic. The seamless integration of vine paths aligns with the digital theme of the image, suggesting careful design consideration to maintain visual cohesion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains consistent visual harmony between the foreground projections and the background landscape. The lighting and fog effects are smoothly integrated, without abrupt transitions or mismatched elements. This suggests proficient layer blending, ensuring the digital rendering complements the natural aspect efficiently.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays sharp and detailed textures for the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces, demonstrating high-resolution digital work. The edges are well-defined, and the absence of repeating pattern artifacts further supports the quality. This aligns with elements of virtual reality or augmented environments, where high texture quality is crucial.",
