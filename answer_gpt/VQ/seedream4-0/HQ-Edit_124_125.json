    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the figure's raised leg and upper arm appear to be drawn with continuous and smooth lines without any interruptions or sharp breaks. The curves mimic a stylized representation consistent with movement in art. Based on visual observation and the common approach to stylized art, there are no noticeable breaks or disconnected segments. The lines maintain a consistent flow, which is typical in illustrations to portray fluid motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the figure's clothing and the surrounding environment (sky, sand, water) unified in tone, with no abrupt shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are chosen to harmonize with each other. The figure's clothing and the environment, including the sky, sand, and water, all display pastel-like tones that merge seamlessly without any stark contrasts or clashing colors. This color scheme is common in illustrations for a cohesive look. The absence of any abrupt color changes reflects a unified design approach.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is depicted with an exaggerated stylized pose, typical of illustrations focusing on aesthetics over realism. The angle between the neck and torso doesn't present an unnatural break, and the arms maintain smooth lines without visible kinks, adhering to artistic conventions for portraying fluid motion in stylized art. The illustrated form is consistent with depictions that stylize flexibility for visual appeal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is stylized, lacking fine detail textures but rather favoring flat colors typical of illustrations. There are no visible signs of pixelation or smearing. The shading is minimal, maintaining consistency across the clothing and skin. This lack of detailed texture is consistent with the simplified artistic style of the illustration, aiming for clarity and clean lines rather than detailed realism.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B seems to be simplified and stylized, typical of the visual language often used in illustrations where details such as fingers might not be fully defined. Digital artwork often opts for simplified forms for stylization without precision in anatomical features. Upon examination, it does not clearly depict five distinct fingers with natural curvature or precise contact with the foot due to the stylized abstraction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow beneath the figure aligned with the sun’s position in the sky and does it taper naturally toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow beneath the figure appears to be simplified and stylized. In typical artistic representations, shadows are depicted in ways that enhance the aesthetic rather than strictly follow realistic physics. While the shadow does taper, its alignment may not precisely adhere to realistic shadow casting from the sun’s position, often adjusted for visual impact in illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible halos, jagged edges, or blending errors along the outline of the figure, particularly around the raised leg and arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observed in Image B, the figure's outline maintains smooth lines typical of digital illustrations, with no halos or jagged edges. The blending of colors and lines appears clean, adhering to the art style’s principles, indicating effective use of digital tools to achieve a polished look. This smoothness confirms a high-quality rendering without apparent blending errors.",
