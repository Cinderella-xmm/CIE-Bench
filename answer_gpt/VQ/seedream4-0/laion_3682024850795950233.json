      "question": "Does the bread slice retain a natural crumb texture and crust edge without visible smoothing or unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B analysis shows the bread slice with an appropriate crumb texture and crust edge that resembles actual bread. The visual representation suggests a typical bread appearance with natural roughness, indicating that there are no visible smoothing or distortions in the texture or edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial features positioned within the bread slice and aligned with its surface plane, without appearing detached or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text is visible on the surface of the bread slice, but it does not depict facial features. The text appears embedded within the surface without floating above it, maintaining alignment with the plane of the bread. Thus, regarding any form of illustration, they seem properly positioned rather than detached.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lettuce leaves forming the cape show consistent leaf texture and natural curling, without flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features an illustration of a knight with a cape that is not made of lettuce leaves. However, given the knight's design, the cape is consistently textured and colored, bearing resemblance to a typical cartoon illustration. There are no flat or uniformly colored sections suggesting a loss of detailâ€”typical quirks of illustrated capes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the hand-drawn illustrations in the timeline clearly defined with uniform stroke thickness and no visible pixelation or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows various illustrations in the timeline such as knights and battles that are drawn with uniform stroke thickness. The lines are clear, and there is no visible pixelation or broken lines, which is consistent with well-rendered cartoon illustrations that maintain clarity and uniformity.",

      "question": "Are all circular icons perfectly round with smooth edges and consistent fill color, without any jaggedness or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features two circular icons that appear well-rendered with smooth edges and consistent fill color. Upon examination, these icons exhibit no jaggedness or irregularities, consistent with high-quality illustrated graphics where smoothness and uniformity are prioritized.",
