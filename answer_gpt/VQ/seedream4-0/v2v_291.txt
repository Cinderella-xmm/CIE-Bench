    "Question": "Q1: Do the hippo and rabbit maintain their natural proportions and structural consistency in the 3D cartoon design without any visible distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hippo and rabbit are depicted in a stylized 3D cartoon design. This style inherently involves abstracting and exaggerating certain features for a cute and playful effect, meaning the proportions are altered compared to real life. For instance, both the hippo and rabbit have oversized heads compared to their bodies, typical of cartoon designs to emphasize cuteness rather than natural realism.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the gentle lighting and cozy tones in the 3D design enhance the natural appearance of the hippo and rabbit without creating any unnatural highlights or shadows?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is soft, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that suits the cartoon style. The lighting techniques used do not seek to mimic natural lighting conditions accurately but are intended to complement the stylized aesthetics of the characters, enhancing their appearance without introducing stark or unnatural shadows.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the fine details of the hippo's skin texture and the rabbit's fur preserved in the 3D design without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a 3D cartoon representation that does not include minute textures like skin and fur details, as these elements are generally simplified to maintain the smooth, clean appearance typical of 3D cartoon models. This simplification is an artistic choice, not an unintended loss of detail.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the placement of the title banner and nameplate integrate seamlessly with the 3D design of the hippo and rabbit, maintaining visual credibility and not disrupting the harmony between the characters?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner and nameplate are elements that are visually integrated into the overall scene. They align with the style of the cartoon design and contribute to the playful and game-like feel without causing any disruption to the harmony between the hippo and rabbit characters.",
