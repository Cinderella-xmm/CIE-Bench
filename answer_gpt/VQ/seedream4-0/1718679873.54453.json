      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature robot model inside the display case appears to have a consistent and proportionate design similar to the original robot in Image A. The robot’s limbs, torso, and head are visually coherent and maintain a uniform scale that suggests accurately preserved geometric shapes without any visible distortion. This conclusion is based on comparing the visual elements in both images. Therefore, the model in Image B seems to preserve the original’s proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B appears transparent and smooth, allowing clear visibility of the robot model within. The transparency indicates that light interacts naturally with the surface, and there are no visible signs of jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts, which would suggest imperfections. The surface seems well-rendered, maintaining a consistent appearance indicating good visual quality and realistic light interaction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robot’s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny gears appear uniformly detailed and are positioned beneath transparent panels surrounding the robot. They seem to be adequately aligned with the design, with no anomalies like misalignment, overlap, or floating appearance. The gears complement the overall design, suggesting a precise and coherent rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hexagonal base in Image B is geometrically precise with sharp, uniform edges and displays a consistent matte-black finish. The model number '1020' is clear, sharp, and evenly glowing. There appears to be no haloing or distortion, indicating a well-maintained design quality for both the base and the text. The visual cues suggest high-quality rendering with attention to geometric accuracy and finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mini landscape surrounding the display case includes trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements. These elements appear naturally scaled relative to the display case and model, maintaining spatial consistency. The trees are proportionate, and the ground texture complements the overall scale of the scene. The distant cityscape is a subtle detail that aligns with the portrayed environment. These observations reaffirm spatial harmony within the image.",
