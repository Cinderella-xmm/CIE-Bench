    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are depicted with pronounced muscle groups that are stylized but still maintain a form of anatomical plausibility. The muscles appear exaggerated but follow the typical contour and alignment of muscle groups found in a well-developed human arm. The deltoids, biceps, and triceps are outlined clearly, and they are connected in a way that reflects the underlying bone structure. Although idealized, this depiction does not violate basic anatomical proportions and joint alignment.",
