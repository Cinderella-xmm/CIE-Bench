      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dog and its blue mat appear consistent with the lighting of a snowy mountain setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting conditions typical of a snowy mountain setting include bright, diffuse light due to the snow reflecting sunlight. The shadows on the dog and mat are soft and subtle, aligning with the ambient light environment. Highlights on the dog's fur and the puffed texture of the mat are consistent with a scene that is well-lit by snow-reflected sunlight, supporting the sense of realism in the portrayal of light.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog's fur retain its natural texture and detail without showing any unnatural artifacts after being placed in the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur appears natural, with clear texture and detail that aligns with what is expected of a real dog's coat. The editing effectively preserved the natural look without introducing artifacts such as blurring, pixelation, or unnatural color changes, even within the bright and contrast-rich snowy environment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the size and proportions of the dog and its blue mat appropriately scaled in relation to the tent and other elements of the snowy campsite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size of the dog and mat relative to the tent and surrounding camping gear such as backpacks appears proportionate. The dog's size compared to the tent and its environment adheres to realistic dimensions, suggesting they were scaled well for the setting. The relationship between the size of common camping items helps in estimating and perceiving their relative proportion correctly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dog and its blue mat smoothly integrated into the snowy mountain campsite without any visible jagged or unnatural lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the dog and its mat blend naturally into the snowy background. There are no visible jagged lines or abrupt transitions between the dog/mat and the snow that could indicate poor editing. The smooth integration suggests careful attention to maintaining a seamless appearance in the composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dog's posture and the overall layout of the snowy campsite appear natural and free from distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's relaxed and lying posture on the mat appears natural and typical of a dog comfortably resting, even in a snowy environment. The overall campsite layout, including the alignments of tents, snow, and gear, is coherent and free from any perceptible distortions or incongruities that might impact the scene's realism.",
