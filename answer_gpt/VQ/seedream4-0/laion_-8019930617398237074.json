      "question": "Are the floral patterns and lace overlay smoothly blended into the gown without visible seams or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns and lace overlay appear as part of a painted illustration, which naturally offers a smoother blending than real fabrics due to the nature of watercolor art. The use of watercolor allows for seamless transitions, and the patterns are incorporated as part of the artistic representation. World knowledge of watercolor techniques suggests there would be no visible seams as the blending of colors is a key feature of this medium.",

      "question": "Does the hand show five fingers with natural positioning and no deformation, and is the bouquet held in a physically plausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand of the figure in the illustration shows five fingers, and its positioning seems natural as it holds the bouquet. The bouquet is depicted as an easy grip object, and its portrayal in the artwork is consistent with common artistic techniques for illustrating hands holding objects. Considering the style and nature of watercolor illustrations, artists typically avoid deformation in drawings of hands.",

      "question": "Are the watercolor effects evenly distributed without obscuring facial features, dress details, or creating harsh color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor technique creates a gentle wash of colors that blend into each other smoothly without the abrupt boundaries that could obscure dress details or facial features. Watercolors use gradual color variations, which are evident as there are no harsh demarcations in this illustration. The effect contributes to a coherent visual experience, aligning with common practices in watercolor art to emphasize subtlety over bold lines, especially in fashion illustrations.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embossed edges add a decorative touch to the illustration, and they have been applied consistently around the picture. The card is placed firmly within the sleeve, with no evidence of overlap or distortion affecting the subject of the illustration. This presentation is typical for printed cards to maintain a clean and aesthetically pleasing look.",

      "question": "Is the veil still attached correctly to the head, the floral crown intact and properly positioned, and the dress silhouette preserved without warping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated veil flows naturally from the head, confirming that it is attached correctly. The floral crown remains intact and accurately positioned on the head, a crucial aspect in both photographs and artistic representations. Additionally, the dress silhouette maintains its intended form without signs of warping or distortion, as watercolor illustrations allow for a consistent portrayal of shapes and silhouettes.",
