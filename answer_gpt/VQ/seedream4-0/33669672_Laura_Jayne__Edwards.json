    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the statue are smoothly extended and appear proportionally elongated. There are no visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments in the limbs. The pose is dynamic, as typically seen in realistic sculptures, implying an understanding of human anatomy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boots feature geometric patterns which appear uniformly applied, with clean edges and no visible overlapping or fragmented sections. These precise design elements showcase a consistency in the pattern application, typical in sculptural artwork.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire figure, from skin to clothing and boots, is given a coppery metallic sheen, with smooth gradients that create a uniform appearance. There are no patches of mismatched material, maintaining consistency typical of a metallic finish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a specific color palette of metallic tones for the figure, with a turquoise background. There are no unexpected colors, bleeding, or desaturation effects, which suggests a deliberate and controlled color choice that complements the metallic aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is depicted in a poised, dynamic position indicative of careful sculpture work. The weight distribution appears natural, and the joint angles are realistic, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps, crucial for a balanced sculptural form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the extended hand of the statue has five fingers. The fingers display natural spacing and curvature typical of human anatomy, and there are no extra digits or fused joints, aligning with realistic sculpture representation.",
      "weight": 1,
