      "question": "Does the scarf placed around the bear's neck appear naturally attached without introducing unnatural folds or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf is visually assessed based on its placement around the bear's neck. The scarf appears to drape naturally, following the contour of the bear's neck without any visible unnatural folds or gaps. This suggests that the scarf has been digitally integrated well enough to seem part of the bear's attire without disrupting the overall appearance. The reasoning combines an understanding of garment fitting and seamless graphic editing.",

      "question": "Do the scarf's texture and the bear's fur texture integrate seamlessly, avoiding any noticeable artifacts or contrasting material differences?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures of both the scarf and the bear's fur in Image B are assessed to see if they blend without any stark contrast. The bear's fur has a fluffy, soft texture, and the scarf, while visibly distinct in its fabric design, does not present harsh edges or rough transitions. The textures are depicted using digital techniques that maintain a cohesive look, demonstrating no abrupt artifacts or disparities, creating a harmony between the scarf and the bear's appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scarf proportionate to the bear's size, neither appearing overly large nor too small to maintain a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarf's proportion is evaluated against the bear's body size. It wraps adequately around the neck, extending just right to appear visually balanced. The scarf does not overwhelm the bear by being too large, nor does it appear insignificant due to being too small, striking a proportionate balance that looks natural for the bear's size. This is determined by understanding proportionate aesthetics suitable for characters intended for child-friendly designs.",

      "question": "Does the scarf enhance the bear's cuteness factor appropriate for a Children’s Day gift while keeping its design simple and uncluttered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf enhances the cuteness factor of the bear in Image B by adding a playful, aesthetically pleasing element without complicating its look. The design of the scarf is simple, with subtle patterns that add visual interest without clutter. This simplicity and visual enhancement are factors that contribute to its suitability as a cute, children's accessory, likely intended for something like a Children’s Day gift.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bear's facial features and paw details preserved intact after adding the scarf, without any degradation or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the bear's facial features and paw details appear consistently maintained. The addition of the scarf does not disrupt the facial or paw details, and there are no visible artifacts, misalignments, or color shifts that might suggest degradation of these features. The meticulous attention given to preserve these details ensures that the scarf's integration does not detract from the bear's original aesthetic quality.",
