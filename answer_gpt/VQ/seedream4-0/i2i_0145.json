      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the white horse maintain its natural texture and lighting, integrating seamlessly into the new forest background without showing any unnatural contrasts or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white horse stands out against the darker forest background, which naturally highlights its texture. The lighting appears softer compared to the brighter outdoor shot in Image A, as it fits the more diffused, subdued light of a forest setting. The integration looks natural, with smooth gradients and no harsh transitions or shadows that appear out of place for a forest scene. Therefore, it doesn’t show any unnatural contrasts or shadows.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added forest and tree elements visually consistent with the horse's presence, and does the sunlight streaming through the trees create natural highlights and shadows on the horse without unnatural disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest and trees in Image B provide a fitting backdrop that complements the horse’s presence. Sunlight streaming through the trees creates natural beams of light that illuminate parts of the horse, particularly the mane and contours of its body. The highlights and shadows appear organic and are consistent with how light would behave in such an environment, indicating no unnatural disruptions in the lighting effects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hooves of the horse appear to interact naturally with the forest floor, such as showing realistic mud or leaves, and are there any visible artifacts where the grass meets the new forest ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hooves of the horse seem to kick up dust from the forest floor, consistent with a natural running motion. The transition between the grass and forest floor appears seamless with no visible artifacts or discrepancies. The texture and interaction with the ground are convincingly realistic with no noticeable inconsistencies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the horse's body correctly simulate sunlight filtering through the trees and casting shadows from surrounding forest elements, without any unnatural bright spots or dark patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the horse in Image B is soft and diffused, reflecting how light would naturally filter through the canopy of a forest. It casts gentle shadows and highlights that align with the direction and intensity of the light beams seen in the image. There are no abrupt or unnatural bright spots or dark patches that would suggest an error in the lighting application.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the horse’s leap look structurally coherent with the new forest setting, with appropriate motion blur and a trajectory that suggests a natural leap from within the shadows without any geometric distortions or visual incongruities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's leap is depicted with a lifelike trajectory and posture that feel coherent and fitting within the shaded forest setting. The motion blur is appropriately subtle, implying speed without overpowering the image. There are no geometric distortions or mismatches in the horse’s pose that disrupts its integration into the shadowed environment, suggesting a natural leap.",
