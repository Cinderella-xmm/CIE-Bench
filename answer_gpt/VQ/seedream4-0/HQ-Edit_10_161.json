      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features a mosaic pattern, and each tile of the mosaic is separate and distinct. The geometric shapes are formed by these individual tiles rather than being part of a single continuous pattern. This creates a non-continuous appearance because each piece is separate. Unlike traditional fabric patterns, which are continuous and printed, the mosaic approach can inherently lead to edges where tiles meet. This is also confirmed by comparing it to Image A, where the patterns are printed and continuous. Thus, the geometric patterns in Image B are not continuous or free from breaks.",

      "question": "Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklaces are composed of small tiles resembling stained glass. Each tile appears to be well-defined, with apparent breaks between them, characteristic of mosaic designs. However, there are no visible jagged or pixelated edges, and the tiles have a consistent appearance. The transition between tiles appears smooth, maintaining the appearance of stained glass. Anything resembling a gradient is not present as each small piece is distinct in color. In comparison, Image A shows beaded necklaces, which do not have the characteristics of stained glass.",

      "question": "Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids remain distinguishable and appear individually crafted with beads separating them distinctly, which aligns with how traditional braids are perceived. The transitions between the segments of the braids are smooth and consistent with how real hair would be adorned. There are no collapsed or fused strands, suggesting that the edited image maintains the integrity of individual braids as seen in natural hairstyles. A comparison with Image A, which also shows individual and carefully adorned braids, supports this observation.",

      "question": "Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a textile or tapestry art piece instead of a natural outdoor setting. The woven and stitched textures and colored patterns create an artistic rather than realistic landscape depiction. Due to its nature as an artistic creation, there are no natural elevation changes or varied textures akin to real landscapes. In comparison, Image A displays an actual natural environment with varying textures and colors expected in an outdoor scene.",

      "question": "Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bracelets are clearly defined and seem to maintain symmetrical positioning on each arm. The number of bracelets and their orientation are consistent on both arms with no visible distortion, stretching, or overlap. The design appears intentional and part of the whole mosaic aesthetic depicted in the image. By comparing with Image A, where the bracelets are stylistically consistent with real-world counterparts, Image B preserves the intent and proportionality despite the mosaic representation.",
