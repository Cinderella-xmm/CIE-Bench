      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as eyes and mouth are added to the feather earrings. The placement of these features is done in a way that maintains proportionality to the size of the feather and does not disrupt the flow of the engraved lines. There are no unnatural texture contrasts, and the engraved lines seem to be skillfully adapted to accommodate these features without distortion. ",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

      "question": "Is there a visible and logically connected arm-like extension from one earring to the other, suggesting motion, and are both earrings still properly attached to their hooks without floating or detachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the earrings with added arm-like features, connecting the two earrings in a way that suggests motion, as they are holding hands.
