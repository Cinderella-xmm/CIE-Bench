    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the neon accents added to the motorcycleâ€™s body emitting a consistent, smooth glow without harsh edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon accents on the motorcycle are smooth and consistently glowing, without any noticeable harsh edges or pixelated areas. This can be deduced from the visual appearance of the neon rings around the wheels and other highlighted parts which maintain a uniform luminosity that blends smoothly with the motorcycle, exhibiting a polished and clear design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hover wheels maintain symmetrical, closed geometric forms without visible deformation or broken spokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hover wheels of the motorcycle are visibly symmetrical with closed geometric forms, displaying well-defined circular shapes and consistent lines throughout. This indicates a precise design with proper alignment and without any distortion or broken spokes affecting the integrity of their appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital interface seamlessly embedded in the front panel without intersecting or obscuring existing elements like the headlight or mirrors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital interface in Image B is integrated into the front panel, appearing as a part of the display. It does not overlap or obscure crucial elements of the motorcycle, such as the headlight or mirrors, maintaining a clear separation and allowing these elements to be fully visible without interference from the digital components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the isometric box exhibit uniform edge lengths and correct angles, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an isometric box with uniform edge lengths and correct angles, as the structure maintains parallel lines and consistent corner shapes, suggesting a well-rendered geometric form. No skewed faces or misaligned corners are evident, further confirming the box's precise construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent window is clear and without signs of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting. The view of the motorcycle behind the window is sharp and undistorted, allowing for a precise visual of its features and highlights without interference from optical artifacts.",
