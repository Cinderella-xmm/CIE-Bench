    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a serif font with a distressed gold texture that matches the typewriter’s material and color tone, and does it appear seamlessly integrated into the image without overlapping or obscuring key objects like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Stories Through Time' is visually observed in a serif font style, rendered in a gold texture. This texture complements the antique feel of the typewriter's material and the warm tones of the image. The placement of the text is carefully done so that it does not obscure or overlap significant objects in the image like the typewriter or lamp, keeping the focus on these elements while adding an artistic touch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the sepia filter apply evenly across all elements—such as the wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall—without causing uneven color shifts, loss of texture detail, or artificial flattening of shadows and highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the application of a sepia filter is apparent as it casts a warm, vintage tone over the entire image. The wooden desk, typewriter, lamp, and wall all exhibit this filter consistently, showing no signs of uneven color transitions. The details, such as the texture of the wood grain on the desk and the intricate designs of the typewriter, remain clear. Shadows and highlights are retained without appearing artificially flattened, ensuring the depth and detail are preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ghostly pages positioned around the typewriter in a flowing, semi-transparent manner, avoiding sharp edges or unnatural overlaps with solid objects like the typewriter body or desk surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several ghostly pages are depicted emanating from the typewriter. These pages are semi-transparent and arranged in a flowing motion, which adds to the ethereal quality of the image. They curve naturally and do not exhibit sharp edges, nor do they create unnatural overlaps upon the typewriter or desk, suggesting careful consideration in their placement to maintain visual cohesion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Art Deco border present along the edges of the image, featuring symmetrical geometric patterns and consistent thickness, without cutting into or distorting any central elements like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a distinct Art Deco border frames the image. This border is characterized by symmetrical geometric patterns and maintains a consistent thickness around the edges. Importantly, it does not intersect with or distort any of the central elements of the composition, such as the typewriter or lamp, thus effectively enhancing the overall aesthetic without interfering with the primary subjects of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the typewriter retain its original shape, alignment of keys, and mechanical structure without visible deformation, stretching, or broken geometry despite the addition of new elements like text and ghostly pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter maintains its original form and structure. The keys are aligned consistently and there is no apparent deformation, stretching, or broken geometry evident. The artistic additions, such as the text 'Stories Through Time' and the ghostly pages, integrate without impacting the mechanical integrity or visual appearance of the typewriter, preserving its antique and sturdy aesthetic.",
