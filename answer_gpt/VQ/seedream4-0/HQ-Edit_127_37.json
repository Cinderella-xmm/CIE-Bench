      "question": "Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the chibi knight features consistent metallic armor that is reflective and smooth, resembling typical knight armor in texture and glossiness without visible warping or unnatural smoothing. The surface details and reflections appear authentic and coherent with expected standards of metallic textures in knight armor.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome has well-defined edges, and the light refraction through it appears realistic, enhancing its transparency and curvature. The elements within the dome, such as the knight and surrounding scenery, are fully enclosed by the dome without any intersecting or clipping issues. The glass appears to wrap seamlessly around the display, maintaining its intended form and function.",

      "question": "Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight's shield is simplified compared to Image A, which originally has a detailed embossed lion design. The edited shield does not retain an embossed design but rather shows a smooth metallic appearance without intricate detailing. The metallic sheen is present, but the fine details of the lion design are not visible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts sheep that are significantly smaller in proportion to the chibi knight, consistent with a scale that highlights their diminutive size compared to a human or knight figure. Their wool texture appears natural, and the sheep are placed firmly on the ground without visible issues of floating or clipping, showcasing anatomically correct shapes and orientation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dragonâ€™s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon depicted in Image B forms a visually coherent curve around the turret, fitting neatly within the glass dome display. Its body shows a consistent scaly texture along the length without visible gaps or deformation, ensuring it appears natural and integrated with the environment.",
