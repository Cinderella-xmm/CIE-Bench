    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel joints clearly defined, aligned with the frame's geometry, and rendered with consistent metallic texture and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the steampunk-themed creation replaces the bicycle in Image A. The cogwheel joints are crucial mechanical components in steampunk designs, typically characterized by intricate detailing and precise alignment. The cogwheel joints in the image appear to have well-defined edges and are integrated into the mechanical beetle's structure, maintaining alignment with the overall geometry. The metallic texture and coppery shading are consistent throughout, enhancing the steampunk aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carapace-shaped seat have detailed surface textures, proper curvature, and seamless attachment to the seat post without visible seams or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carapace-shaped seat in Image B mimics the beetle's shell, common in steampunk renditions. The surface displays intricate patterns and a realistic curvature suggestive of an insect's exoskeleton. The attachment to the body is smooth, with no visible seams or distortions, maintaining the visual integrity and unity of the design, typical of well-executed steampunk art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mechanical legs have realistic hinge mechanisms, correct proportions, and no overlapping or misplaced segments that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical legs mimic the limbs of an insect and are detailed to fit within the steampunk motif. Each leg features visible hinges, indicative of functional movement. Their proportions match the overall scale of the beetle body, and they are symmetrically placed, with no overlapping parts or spatial inconsistencies, which preserve the mechanical feasibility of the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wingtips smoothly attached to the top tube, showing consistent copper coloring, reflective properties, and no jagged edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B are attached smoothly to the mechanism, demonstrating a seamless integration with consistent copper tones that align with the rest of the machine's aesthetic. The reflective properties and textures throughout the wings are uniform, with no signs of jagged edges or texture repetition, ensuring a coherent presentation aligned with steampunk design characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock faces clearly visible, properly embedded in the handlebars, and free from texture artifacts, incorrect lighting, or distorted numerals/runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock faces in Image B are integral to the steampunk theme and are embedded into the structure as part of the control interface. They are prominently visible with clear detailing, and the numerals are correctly formed and legible. There are no artifacts or distortions from lighting, ensuring the clocks fit naturally into the item's overall design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all newly added mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) share consistent material properties, such as metallic sheen, color tone, and surface imperfections, without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) display a cohesive material design consistent with the steampunk genre. The metallic sheen and copper color tones are unified across all parts, enhancing the impression of a singular mechanical entity. Surface imperfections, such as slight weathering, add realism but are uniformly applied, ensuring no sudden visual breaks or discrepancies in material properties.",
