      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being converted into a stained glass style, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is transformed into a stained glass style with colored panes forming its surface. The structure of the skateboard is evident as the outline is maintained, and the sections where the grip tape and deck holes are typically seen are now filled with colored glass patterns. This retains the skateboard's essential shape and credibility. The stained glass texture naturally adds an artistic effect without losing the core details that make it recognizable as a skateboard.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the kitchen sink and cabinets preserved without distortion, maintaining their physical rationality in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric elements of the kitchen, such as the sink and cabinets, have been transformed into a stained glass style. The outlines and construction of these elements are maintained accurately, even though they are divided into patterns of colored glass. The straight lines and angles of the cabinets and the curved shape of the sink are all preserved, ensuring that their physical form remains rational and intact.",

      "question": "Does the stained glass effect applied to the countertop and backsplash tiles appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the countertop and backsplash have been rendered in a stained glass style, which involves colored glass pieces fitted together. The stained glass effect covers these areas smoothly, forming a cohesive pattern without introducing any noticeable artifacts or distortions. The transition of different colored glass pieces forms a harmonious pattern, mimicking the irregular yet deliberate style typical in stained glass art.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets visually credible and coherent, without any noticeable breaks or inconsistencies in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition in Image B between the stained glass-styled skateboard, sink, and cabinets is seamless, suggesting that the elements are part of a unified stained glass depiction. There are no visible breaks or inconsistencies in the stained glass patterns at the junctions where these objects meet, which indicates that the transition is handled smoothly and the coherence of style is maintained across different elements within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details of the objects, such as the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles, remain authentic and detailed within the stained glass style, avoiding any degradation of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details, like the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles, are depicted with stained glass textures. Despite this artistic transformation, such details remain recognizable and retain their essential characteristicsâ€”wheels remain round and discernible, and handles are identifiable in shape and form. These details avoid degradation and are effectively integrated into the stained glass style, ensuring the authenticity and recognizability of each element.",
