      "question": "Is the elephant's size reduced proportionally so that its limbs, head, and body maintain correct relative proportions and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant's proportions appear correct as its limbs, head, and body exhibit natural curves and dimensions. This is assessed by evaluating whether the body parts conform to the expected anatomical proportions of an elephant, which they do. Each segment is proportionate to one another just like a regular-sized elephant, suggestive of a scaled-down proportion without distortion.",

      "question": "Do the golden inlays follow the contours and patterns of the original wood carvings without creating abrupt edges or mismatched material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold inlays are smoothly integrated into the intricate wood carvings with precision. Visual analysis shows how the gold accents complement the existing detailed patterns, maintaining a natural flow without uneven edges. The consistency in texture and the continuity of patterns with the wood suggest skilled artistry in blending materials without harsh transitions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bonsai trees positioned at a scale consistent with the miniaturized elephant and do they exhibit natural leaf shapes, branch structures, and ground-level placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bonsai trees enhance the scale impression with the miniature elephant. The leaves and branches are intricately shaped and presented, reflecting realistic botanical features. Their positioning at ground level aligns naturally in size, making them appear consistent with the dimension of the reduced elephant, supporting a believable miniature scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the miniature jungle feature natural earthy tones and textures such as soil, moss, and plant matter that are consistent with real-world botanical materials and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a miniature jungle setting, where the tones and textures are visually representative of natural landscapes. The soil and plant materials employ hues and textures that evoke real-world botanical scenarios. The incorporation of moss and other earthy tones under lighting further reinforces the realistic interpretation of a jungle scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the new stone base smooth and polished with clear, continuous floral engravings that do not exhibit jagged lines, missing segments, or inconsistent depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone base is visible with well-defined floral engravings that flow seamlessly without interruption. The surface appears smooth and polished, projecting an impression of artisan stonework. By focusing on the edges and continuity of the floral patterns, there is no evidence of jagged lines or missing sections, indicating consistent, skillful engraving depth.",
