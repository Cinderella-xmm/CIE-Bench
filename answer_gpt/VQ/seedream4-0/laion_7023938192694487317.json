      "question": "Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the transition to a mannequin form, the torso appears proportionately designed without any visible warping or distortion. The shoulders, neck, and waist retain their expected proportions consistent with a standard mannequin display, suggesting a well-scaled structure typically used in retail or presentation environments.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt's surface appears smooth and lacks any visible fabric weave or texture that would suggest a fabric material. Instead, the finish is uniform, reflecting a matte or polymer-like quality typically seen in mannequin displays, which do not have fabric weave patterns or glossy highlights.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question": "Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base is visually analyzed as having a smooth, polished metal appearance with subtle reflective highlights. This suggests a high-quality finish, indicative of polished metal. The connection between the base and figurine appears secure yet separable, typical of detachable mannequins or display models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the facial area is blurred, leaving it unassessed for detailed features such as eyes, beard, and glasses, the transition of the modification appears smooth around the neck and shoulder area with no visible signs of distortion or blending issues. As such, in terms of junction integrity, it remains appropriately integrated with the modified torso.",
