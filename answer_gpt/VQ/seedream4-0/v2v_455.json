      "question": "Do the stickers maintain a consistent Chibi Ghibli cartoon aesthetic with bright, vibrant colors without introducing unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sticker showcases a Chibi-style character engaging in snow-related activities. The elements, like the character and Totoro, align with the Chibi Ghibli cartoon aesthetic. Analyzing the colors, they are bright, vibrant, and typical of animated styles, evident from elements like the vivid snowboards and the character's orange jacket. There are no signs of unnatural textures or loss of detail that would deviate from the expected cartoon aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the character's proportions and physical rationality preserved in all stickers, avoiding any distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each character depiction maintains the Chibi aesthetic, which inherently involves exaggerated roundness and smaller stature. Despite this stylization, the character's actions, such as snowboarding or rolling a snowball, appear proportionate within the context of the stickers. The physical rationality remains intact, as all actions portrayed are feasible within a Chibi world, showing no bizarre distortions.",

      "question": "Do the stickers avoid any extra or disjointed elements outside the primary design, maintaining a clean and cohesive look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, each sticker focuses on the core subject matter - the character or Totoro engaged in snow-related activities. There are no additional or disjointed elements outside what is expected within these scenarios. Each sticker maintains focus and simplicity, resulting in a clean and cohesive design across the set.",

      "question": "Does each sticker provide a complete depiction of the character, ensuring no parts are omitted and maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sticker depicts the character entirely, without any missing or omitted parts. The figures, such as the character snowboarding or standing, are all complete and structurally coherent within the context of each sticker. There are no abrupt cut-offs or missing segments, which supports the structural completeness of each depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a uniform white outline consistently applied around each sticker, enhancing the sticker-like effect without disrupting the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a uniform white outline is indeed present around each sticker. This outline serves to highlight the character and preserve the sticker-like appearance, making each element stand out against a faux background. Itâ€™s applied consistently around the figures, enhancing the stylistic choice without disrupting the cartoon's natural appearance.",
