      "question": "Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human figure is composed of sushi pieces arranged in a way that mimics a human shape. The pieces are aligned with one another to form continuous lines, such as the arms, legs, and torso. There don't appear to be any gaps or noticeable distortions in the layout, indicating a well-maintained structure.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the human figure, the sushi pieces display a mix of colors like orange (from salmon), white (rice), green (from cucumber or avocado), and black (from seaweed wrap) which are consistent with common sushi ingredients. Observing the original sushi map, these colors are similarly utilized, maintaining their natural appearance. There are no unusual colors present.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces in the human figure have well-defined, sharp edges as seen in their square and rectangular shapes, indicating a clean edit with no blurring or pixelation. These features are consistent with a focus on maintaining clarity and precision in the presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces in the human figure are similar in size and shape to the pieces in the original sushi map, maintaining a consistent scale. The pieces look realistic and proportionate, with no apparent distortion, indicating careful editing to preserve their initial form.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arm formed by the sushi pieces is positioned in a manner that resembles an arm being lifted, achieving a relatively natural posture. The alignment of pieces indicates a coherent structure that doesn't exhibit unnatural bends or angles beyond what would be expected in such a position.",
