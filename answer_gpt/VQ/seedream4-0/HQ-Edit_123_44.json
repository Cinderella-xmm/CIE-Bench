      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case exhibits clear and sharp surfaces, evident by the unobstructed view of the aircraft and the edges of the case. There are no visible distortions, scratches, or unusual reflections on the glass. World knowledge indicates that a well-crafted glass display should appear immaculate unless rubbed or scratched, aligning with how glass typically interacts with light. This lack of imperfections suggests a high-quality glass material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather accents and brass corners on the display case in Image B are depicted with textures reflective of real-world materials. The leather shows texture details that imply natural wear and usability over time, and the brass corners reflect light in a consistent manner. Proper attachment suggests that these objects are part of the case structure, and no seams or gaps are visible between component parts, preventing any unnatural appearance of floating.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved emblem on the leather base of the display case is detailed, with shadows that show appropriate depth, indicating the engraving process captured its intended intricacy. Given its position on leather, rather than the glass surface, the emblem blends naturally and adds authenticity to the leather's appearance. The design elements conform to the style typically associated with detailed engravings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature clouds within the glass case in Image B are portrayed with a volumetric and soft texture, suggesting a fluffy shape common in realistic cloud depictions. Positioned at the base of the aircraft, they are visually distinct and separate from it, without any signs of clipping against the aircraft or other objects in the case. The transparency appears natural, maintaining the clouds' visual integrity without indicating translucence or sharp edges.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the propellers of the aircraft have motion blur indicative of the spinning motion, a detail that accurately reflects how spinning objects tend to appear due to the continuous speed. This blur is aligned with the engine nacelles, showing that the propellers are attached to their correct parts and not deforming. Additionally, the depiction avoids any clipping of the propellers against the case boundaries, respecting the physical space provided by the glass enclosure.",
