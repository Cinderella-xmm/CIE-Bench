      "question": "Does the surface of the ballerina’s body show consistent marble texture with subtle chisel marks across all areas including arms, torso, legs, and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is a sculpture with the characteristic marble texture visible across its surface. The surface shows the typical marble sheen and subtle variations suggesting chisel marks, consistent across the visible areas of arms, torso, and legs. Marble sculptures often present a smooth yet textured appearance due to the carving process. Therefore, the ballerina’s body in Image B shows a consistent marble texture across the areas described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the folds and flow of the robe draped over the ballerina's body physically plausible and consistent with how heavy fabric would hang on a sculpted form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robe in Image B appears to mimic the draping of heavy fabric with realistic folds that adhere to gravity and the contours of the sculpted form. The texture and patterns formed by the draping are consistent with marble sculptures where folds are carefully carved to simulate fabric. Thus, the robe’s folds and flow are physically plausible and align with expectations of sculpted robes.",

      "question": "Is the laurel wreath positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape or causing misalignment with facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laurel wreath is placed on the head, showing no distortion of the skull shape or facial feature misalignment. Laurel wreaths are typically positioned around the forehead area on classical sculptures, and in this image, it appears to be correctly aligned with the head’s shape. Thus, it maintains anatomical proportionality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the feet retain proper human anatomy and alignment while appearing as carved stone, with no deformation or disproportionate elongation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feet in Image B appear to maintain correct human anatomy and alignment consistent with typical sculptural representations. They mimic a natural stance and are well-proportioned, resembling carved stone with no visible distortion or elongation. The sculpted position reflects typical artistic attention to anatomical accuracy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the Ionic columns and mosaic floor aligned with the figure’s scale and perspective, showing no mismatch in depth or proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Ionic columns and mosaic floor are shown with correct perspective, maintaining proportionate depth relative to the figure. The columns’ scale corresponds realistically with the height of the figure, and the floor aligns consistently with her stance, indicating no mismatch in scale or perspective typically seen in classical settings.",
