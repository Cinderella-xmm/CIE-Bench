    "Question": "Q1: Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the pig appears proportionately large compared to the body. The neck and shoulder areas show no visible distortions or unnatural seams. The proportions have been maintained, suggesting a coherent design where the larger head fits naturally with the body and attire. This is depicted through the smooth transition from the head to the body, indicating a deliberate caricature style rather than a fault in rendering.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",

Considering the description requires a clear comparison of this feature, there's no visible cue in the edited image ensuring that the analysis of their consistency can't be performed.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",

The design choice matches typical stylized animal anatomy rather than realistic human-like hands, showing natural spacing and curvature that align with the stylized portrayal of a pig.",
