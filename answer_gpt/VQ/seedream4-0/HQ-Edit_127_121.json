      "question": "Are the iridescent wings attached to the spider’s thorax symmetrically and do they display smooth, continuous mosaic-like patterns without jagged edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider features wings that are attached to the thorax and exhibit an iridescent, mosaic-like design. Visually, these wings appear symmetrical both in positioning and pattern, which is important for maintaining a sense of natural balance in design. The mosaic pattern on the wings is smooth and continuous, without any visible jagged edges or interruptions, which is not only an aesthetic choice but also indicates a high level of detail and craftsmanship in the editing. This perfection in symmetry and pattern suggests careful design comparable to stained glass mosaics known for their smooth transitions and vivid coloration. Thus, the wings in Image B are attached symmetrically and have smooth patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminous orb positioned where the original abdomen was, and does it maintain proportional size and alignment with the spider’s body without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider's abdomen has been replaced with a luminous orb. This orb appears in the same position as the original spider's abdomen, suggesting no displacement. The size of the orb is proportionate, maintaining the overall balance of the spider's body and fitting seamlessly in its place. It aligns well with the rest of the spider's body structure, neither looking disproportionate nor misaligned. The positioning reflects a careful consideration to ensure the edited element remains coherent with the natural anatomy of the spider.",

      "question": "Do the golden filigree spirals wrap around each leg segment smoothly, following the natural bends and joints without breaking or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each leg of the spider is adorned with golden filigree spirals. These spirals are designed to wrap around the spider's legs meticulously. The decorations follow the natural contours of the legs, including bends and joints, which are crucial for maintaining a realistic and coherent appearance. Importantly, there is no visible fragmentation or illogical overlapping in the spirals, indicating a smooth transition along each segment. The filigree enhances the spider’s aesthetic without interfering with its form or function, showing attention to detail and effective design integration.",

      "question": "Are the fangs now thin, translucent, and needle-shaped, extending naturally from the spider’s mouth area without appearing misshapen or disconnected?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a transformation of the spider's fangs, showing them as thin, translucent, and needle-shaped structures. These fangs extend naturally from the spider's mouth area, which is crucial for maintaining biological realism in depictions. They do not appear to be misshapen or disconnected from the spider’s mouth, ensuring that the visual alteration harmonizes with the existing anatomy of the spider. The thinness and translucency suggest a delicate material choice that maintains a natural connection to the body.",

      "question": "Does the ethereal aura surround the spider uniformly, fading gently into the background without visible streaks, sharp edges, or interference with nearby leaves or web strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ethereal aura in Image B uniformly envelops the spider, serving as a visual enhancement to signify an otherworldly or magical quality. The aura fades smoothly into the background of the image, indicative of a skilled blending technique. There are no visible streaks or sharp edges that disrupt the seamless transition into the surrounding space. The aura also avoids interfering with the nearby leaves or web strands, thus preserving the integrity of these elements and ensuring they remain distinct within the composition. This careful integration reflects a successful implementation of the aura effect without disrupting the scene’s coherence.",
