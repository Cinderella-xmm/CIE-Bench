    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is composed of clear, well-cut crystal facets that replicate the shape of the original sandcastle from Image A. These facets reflect light and have a smooth, polished appearance, aligned with the overall geometry of the original structure. There are no visible jagged or incomplete edges, indicating a precise and careful representation in glass form. This alignment with the original geometry suggests a meticulous approach to maintaining the castle's design integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gemstones have taken the place of seashells, maintaining their positions and relative sizes as seen in Image A. These gemstones appear to have smooth, reflective surfaces, indicating a replacement that preserves the visual texture and light interaction seen with actual seashells. Their positioning suggests they are correctly situated on the display's surface, without unrealistic floating effects.",

      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wave pattern etched into the frosted glass in Image B has a continuous, flowing appearance. It captures the essence of a wave without any visible abrupt breaks or unnatural lines, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing representation fitting with the ocean theme. This continuous line work ensures the pattern is visually coherent and effective in its depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B shows clear, straight edges that frame the scene without distortion. The perspective appears consistent across the elements, with no indication of clipping or warping. This suggests the edges align well with the perspective of the room, maintaining the integrity of the display case design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldnâ€™t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red shovel with a yellow handle is clearly visible and positioned on the surface without distortion. It lies flat, without intersecting with glass surfaces or misplaced positioning that would break the visible realism. This ensures it remains a consistent element transposed from Image A, maintaining its realistic presentation as a tangible object.",
