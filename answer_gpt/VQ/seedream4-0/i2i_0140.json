      "question": "Do the quilts' patterns maintain their structural consistency and detailed appearance without unnatural texture disruption after conversion to a watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor style inherently adds a softer texture to the image, which can lead to a slight smoothing of details. Despite this, the quilts' patterns are still recognizable and maintain their geometric structure and color distribution, indicating that structural consistency is preserved without any significant disruption of detail. The watercolor style affects the appearance by adding a painted effect, but the inherent details are still clear.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the colors of the bedding and surrounding elements been naturally blended into the watercolor style without appearing unnaturally muted or overly vivid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor style provides a natural blending of colors, typical of watercolor paintings, where colors appear slightly softer and more fluid but not unnaturally muted or vivid. The quilts and surrounding elements maintain a balanced hue, with neither the pinks, greens, nor other colors appearing excessively vibrant or dulled, retaining a natural watercolor aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the nightstand, picture frames, and flowers retain their natural shapes and material textures without distortion or unnatural artifacts in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor style slightly abstracts the image but retains the core shapes and dimensions of items like the nightstand, frames, and flowers. The edges are softened, typical in watercolor paintings, but there are no unnatural distortions or artifacts present. The integrity of the objects' recognizable shapes remains intact, aligned with how watercolors typically stylize but not alter in form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the relative positions and proportions of the beds, nightstand, and wall pictures consistent and visually plausible in the watercolor illustration style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In comparing Image A and Image B, the watercolor effect in Image B does not change the layout or proportions of the elements such as the beds, nightstand, and pictures on the wall. These elements retain their original placement and sizes, demonstrating that the transition to a watercolor style kept these relationships intact and believable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the quilt's intricate patchwork design stay recognizable and free from distortion or unnatural simplification in the watercolor illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt's patchwork design, which includes distinct patterns and colors, remains recognizable and clear. While the watercolor style introduces a soft focus effect, the intricate design is neither distorted nor oversimplified to a degree that affects recognition. Each segment of the pattern is still discernible, demonstrating careful adaptation to the watercolor medium.",
