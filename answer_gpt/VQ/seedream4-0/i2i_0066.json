      "question": "Do the 3D printed display model and display plaque appear naturally integrated into the image, without disrupting the sceneâ€™s overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D printed model of a bulldog combines realistic texture and design, featuring the dog standing adjacent to the bouquet of flowers. The display plaque is integrated into the base of the model, providing a cohesive unit that fits into the scene at the tech expo. The natural setting of the expo, including booths and displays behind it, enhances authenticity, suggesting that this model could realistically be presented as an exhibition piece. Therefore, the integration of these elements does not disrupt the authenticity of the scene, as such a model could feasibly be part of an expo display.",

      "question": "Does the texture of the 3D printed model resemble matte PLA plastic realistically, without showing any unnatural surface irregularities or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the bulldog model in Image B appears smooth and uniform, suggesting an even finish consistent with matte PLA plastic, commonly used in 3D printing for its ease of use and appearance. This material imparts a simplistic matte finish that does not display surface irregularities. The uniformity in surface texture supports the realism of a PLA plastic appearance. Thus, the texture is realistic without any visible artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the display plaque at the base positioned correctly, maintaining structural consistency and contributing to the visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display plaque is positioned in a structurally consistent manner at the base of the model, appearing as part of the base's design. This placement aligns with typical presentation standards for informational plaques accompanying models, lending credibility to its presence in a tech expo setting. As such, the base structure supports the visual credibility of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements and the new tech expo booth background appear seamless, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural segmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a tech expo booth as the background, creating a distinct ambiance typically associated with technology showcases. The elements in the foreground, including the 3D model and the bouquet, are smoothly inserted into this setting without visible boundaries or artifacts separating them from the background. This seamless transition avoids any segmentation that could detract from the authenticity of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the 3D printed model and the display plaque realistic and consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario, avoiding any noticeable distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the 3D printed bulldog model and the display plaque appear consistent with expectations for exhibition pieces at a tech expo. The dog's large size matches typical model proportions that attract attention, and the plaque is appropriately sized to provide information without overpowering the display. There are no noticeable distortions in proportions, maintaining realism and consistency.",
