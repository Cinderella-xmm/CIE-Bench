    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without exaggerated or broken limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina figure is designed with attention to detail, showcasing a pose with one arm raised and her body poised on one foot, similar to what a ballet dancer would naturally execute. There are no noticeable exaggerated features or broken limb alignments, suggesting a faithful representation of a ballet pose. By comparing this to Image A, which shows a real person in mid-air performing a similar dance move, it's clear that the designers aimed to mimic a realistic ballet stance within the constraints of a miniature model.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the base of the snow globe display realistic bronze texture with subtle reflective highlights and clearly defined engraved French script, without pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns?",
    "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B is visually engaging with what appears to be a realistic bronze texture. It shows shine and reflections typical of a metallic surface, and the engraved script is clearly defined, resembling actual bronze engraving without pixelation or synthetic distortion. This convincing appearance suggests a high-quality rendering of the texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the snowflakes are distributed in a manner that mimics natural snowfall. They vary in shape and size, contributing to a sense of natural diversity, and are positioned throughout the globe without obvious repetition or clumping. This realistic appearance enhances the visual authenticity of the scene within the snow globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower and other Parisian landmarks within the snow globe are minutely detailed and seem to be appropriately scaled down. They maintain correct perspective, and there are no visible signs of warping or flattening. This careful attention to detail ensures the landmarks' structural integrity in a miniature format.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B shows smooth and natural curvature, effectively bending the light and internal elements slightly to create a realistic refraction effect. There are no jagged edges or abrupt transitions visible, indicating a high-quality design that mimics the properties of a real glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
