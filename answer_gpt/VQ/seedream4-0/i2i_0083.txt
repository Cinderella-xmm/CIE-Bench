    "Question": "Q1: Does the digital display screen appear to fit seamlessly within the rectangular frame previously occupied by the painting, maintaining the same proportions and alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display screen takes up the same position as the painting from Image A. By observing the relative size and position of the screen and comparing it to the painting's location in Image A, it appears the frame proportions are preserved. The screen fits well into the space previously filled by the painting, maintaining a consistent visual balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the texture and surface finish of the digital display screen consistent with the surrounding wall, ensuring it does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or discrepancies in material?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the digital display screen in Image B is noticeably different from the wall's texture as it is typical for display screens, with a smooth, glossy finish. It does not blend into the wall like the matte texture of the painting in Image A. However, this difference is expected due to the nature of screens, and there are no obvious artifacts or discrepancies between the screen and the wall junction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are all the details around the digital display screen, such as the wall edges and the flooring, preserved without any visible distortion or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall edges and flooring appear intact and maintain their details as observed in Image A. There is no noticeable distortion or loss of detail in these areas, suggesting that the modification replaced the painting with the screen without altering nearby surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the digital display screen preserve the balance and symmetry of the room, with the armchairs still appearing naturally aligned relative to the new display screen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display screen is centrally aligned between the two armchairs similar to how the painting was positioned in Image A. This maintains the room's visual symmetry and balance, as the chairs remain proportionally placed relative to the new display, keeping the harmony of the space intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the shadows and light reflections cast by the digital display screen match those expected from a wall-mounted object, without creating unrealistic or conflicting lighting patterns?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B casts realistic shadows and reflections expected from a wall-mounted digital display. There are no odd or conflicting light patterns that would suggest the screen was unnaturally inserted. The reflections and shadows appear consistent with the light sources present in the environment, suggesting a seamless integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
