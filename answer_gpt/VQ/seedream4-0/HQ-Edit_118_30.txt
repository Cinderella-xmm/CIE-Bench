    "Question": "Q1: Are the trainâ€™s locomotive and carriages transformed into interlocking geometric blocks that maintain their original proportions and alignment along the track without visible distortions or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train's locomotive and carriages are stylized with bright, geometric block patterns which retain the overall shape and alignment along the tracks seen in Image A. The blocks are connected seamlessly, showing that the transformation maintains the integrity of the train's structure without causing distortions or misaligned edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the smoke above the train rendered as smooth, continuous swirling white forms that follow the natural trajectory of rising steam without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the steam emanating from the train is depicted as stylized swirling white forms, emerging naturally from the locomotive and smoothly rising upwards. These forms are artfully crafted and do not exhibit any jagged edges or texture artifacts, maintaining a continuous appearance that aligns with the expected trajectory of rising steam.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are all human figures at the station platform replaced by small, flat puzzle-shaped elements wearing vintage clothing, with no visible distortions in limbs or posture, and do they retain recognizable positions relative to benches and luggage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures at the station platform have not been replaced by puzzle-shaped elements; instead, they remain as human figures wearing vintage clothing. These figures are positioned similarly to those in Image A, near the benches and luggage, maintaining the integrity of their form without distortion.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the fields and hills in the background rendered as clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., rectangles, triangles) that form a cohesive, interlocking design without gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fields and hills are depicted as a mosaic of geometric patterns, such as rectangles and triangles, which fit together neatly to form an interlocking design. This geometric landscape lacks visible gaps or overlapping errors, maintaining a cohesive and harmonious appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape, placed on a light wooden tabletop with visible wood grain and consistent lighting, and are there no floating elements or mismatched shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is set against a backdrop that resembles a light wooden surface with visible wood grain. The lighting is consistent across the components of the scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape. This setup eliminates any visual inconsistencies like floating elements or mismatched shadows, which reinforces the unified depiction of the scene on the wooden tabletop.",
    "answer": "Yes"
