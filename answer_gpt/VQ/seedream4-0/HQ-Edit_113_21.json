      "question": "Does the woman’s body posture while leaning against the hut appear physically plausible, with correct alignment of limbs and no unnatural bending or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's body posture appears natural and consistent with reality. The visual cues show her standing with both feet grounded and leaning slightly against the hut, which creates a sense of stability. There are no unnatural bendings or floating limbs observed, suggesting that the posture is physically plausible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beaded jewelry elements on the woman and particularly highlighted in the top right postcard show smooth transitions between colors and maintain geometric patterns. The beads are well-defined with consistent shapes across the surface, indicating no blurring or distortion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each postcard in Image B displays a consistent application of geometric borders. The colorful geometric design surrounds the postcards without interfering with or distorting the main subject or the background elements, maintaining visual balance.",
