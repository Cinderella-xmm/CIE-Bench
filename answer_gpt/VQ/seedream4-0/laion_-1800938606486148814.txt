    "Question": "Q1: Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",
    "explanation": "The transparent upper material on Image B appears to be smooth and uniform, which can be inferred from the clear visual cues indicating a consistent surface texture. There are no visible signs of pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity observed in the visible section of the shoe. These factors are usually evaluated based on surface smoothness and material integrity in a digital rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the neon blue glow around the Swoosh evenly distributed with smooth transitions and no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into neighboring surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The neon blue glow in Image B is visible around the Swoosh logo, showing an even distribution of light. The transitions appear smooth without abrupt color shifts, which is indicative of a controlled light effect. There is no evidence of light leaks into neighboring surfaces, as these typically cause inconsistent luminance on an object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the digital screen on the strap properly aligned with the strapâ€™s curvature, showing clear and stable animation content without pixelation or visual noise?",
    "explanation": "Since the strap in Image B is obscured by blur, it is impossible to assess its alignment with curvature or the clarity of its digital screen content based on the available visual cues. As the question relates to the blurred section, a direct evaluation cannot be conducted.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Does the digital shoe box exhibit consistent geometry and metallic reflection patterns without warped edges or misaligned holographic layers?",
    "explanation": "The digital shoe box section in Image B shows consistent geometry and reflection, as inferred from the visible elements. The contours and metallic reflection patterns appear coherent without visible warping or misalignment. Such observations are assessed based on regular structural lines and clarity in reflective surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the geometric patterns on the shoe box evenly spaced and aligned with the surface contours, without repeating anomalies or misregistration?",
    "explanation": "In the visible section of Image B, geometric patterns are consistently spaced and follow the surface contours accurately. Alignment without anomalies or misregistration suggests careful and precise pattern placement. This analysis involves evaluating spatial uniformity and alignment against known surface curves.",
    "answer": "Yes"
