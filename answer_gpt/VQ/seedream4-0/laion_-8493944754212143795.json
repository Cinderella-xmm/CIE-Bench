      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shimmering mane formed from the water maintain fluid motion and transparency consistent with the original waterfall, without appearing solid or rigid?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's mane is designed to appear as if it is formed from water, giving it a shimmering and fluid look. The transparency and delicate sheen suggest a continuation of the waterfall's fluid motion, similar to how water behaves and reflects light. It does not have solid or rigid characteristics, which aligns well with how water appears in natural motion, as seen by similar flowing and transparent features in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale patterns on the transformed rock body seamlessly integrated with the original stone texture, without visible seams, unnatural repetition, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scales on the dragon in Image B are designed to blend with the stone texture, suggesting a transformation. They appear to be seamlessly integrated without noticeable seams or awkward transitions. The texture does not display unnatural repetition or distortion, matching the natural and organic flow of stones found in Image A. Careful integration is visible where the pattern does not break the continuity of the underlying rock formation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cloud wings formed from the foam extend naturally from the dragon’s body and align with the direction of water movement, without appearing detached or floating unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's wings, represented as clouds, give a visual continuity from the foam present around it. They extend naturally from the dragon's back and do not appear detached. The direction and behavior of the cloud wings align with natural motion and fit cohesively with the water and foam present in the scene. Image A shows water and foam flowing naturally over rocks, which Image B cleverly adapts into the depiction of the dragon's wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing blue runes embedded into the scales with smooth, diffused light emission and no sharp edges or unnatural brightness that disrupts the surrounding texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing blue runes on the dragon resemble natural light patterns seen in bioluminescent features. The light is softly diffused, embedding smoothly within the scales, without disrupting the dragon's scaly texture by having sharp edges or excessive brightness. This choice is coherent with how natural or magical light would reflect, creating a harmonious appearance that doesn't conflict with the other textures or lighting in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon’s body and wings match the direction and intensity of natural sunlight in the original scene, without conflicting illumination or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and highlights on the dragon's body in Image B are consistent with how natural sunlight would fall upon a three-dimensional object. The direction aligns with the presumed light source from the scene and matches the illumination of the surrounding environment found in Image A. The highlights are not floating or misplaced, ensuring a coherent and naturally-lit appearance that complements the realistic portrayal of the dragon.",
