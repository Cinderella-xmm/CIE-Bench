      "question": "Does the enamel pin design maintain the structural coherence of the rocking chair without introducing broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a cartoonish rendition of the rocking chair from Image A. The enamel pin design retains the recognizable features of a rocking chair: curved rockers, vertical slats on the back, and a smooth, consistent texture. The metal outlines help preserve the structure without any broken geometric forms, ensuring the design is coherent and maintains the integrity of the rocking chair's shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there no additional details or elements in the enamel pin design that do not align with the original rocking chair's simplicity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B adds a cute facial feature with eyes and cheeks, a stylistic choice that deviates from the original chair's simplicity found in Image A. This alteration creates an animated character of the chair, combining elements that are not purely related to a chair's function or design.",

      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shiny metal outlines and bold enamel colors appear consistent and natural throughout the enamel pin design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The enamel pin design in Image B utilizes shiny metal outlines that effectively encompass each part of the chair, highlighting the object with consistent bold colors. These colors are evenly distributed, and the outlines create a polished, intentional look, which is typical for enamel pin designs.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the various parts of the rocking chair preserved accurately in the enamel pin design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "With the stylized approach in Image B, some proportions are intentionally exaggerated or modified, such as facial features on the chair. While the fundamental structure, like arms and rockers, is maintained, the proportions deviate slightly from the realistic depiction in Image A to fit the chibi design style more animatedly.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is presented in a square format with an uncomplicated white background. This choice allows the enamel pin design to be highlighted without surrounding distractions, providing clarity and emphasis on the pin itself.",
