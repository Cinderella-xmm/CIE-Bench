      "question": "Does the transparent acrylic display case show no visible distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that affect the appearance of the McLaren?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acrylic display case around the McLaren is transparent, allowing clear visibility of the vehicle inside. Using world knowledge, transparent acrylic typically provides a clear view without distortion if done professionally. Refraction or reflection errors are common when materials interfere with the view, but the clarity in Image B suggests it was done well. Without real-world confirmation, visual cues in the image alone indicate no noticeable issues, leading to the conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the polished chrome base aligned with the car's position and does it reflect light and surroundings naturally without appearing disconnected or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chrome base reflects light and surroundings. Chrome usually has a mirror-like surface that should reflect objects accurately. The alignment of the car's position and reflections in the base suggests a natural and consistent appearance. The visual cues in Image B, with the lack of visible distortion or disconnection and reflection continuity, indicate a proper visual representation.",

      "question": "Are the carbon fiber textures confined to the interior walls of the display case and do they exhibit consistent, non-repeating patterns without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carbon fiber texture is visible on the interior walls behind the McLaren. Carbon fiber patterns are expected to be uniform and consistent. The visual cues demonstrate a consistent texture without anomalies, suggesting it was either a high-quality image or texture design applied correctly. Without any visible glitches or wrong placements, the image reflects a proper execution.",

      "question": "Are the miniature wrenches and screwdrivers proportionally accurate compared to the McLaren and positioned in a way that suggests intentional placement without floating or clipping through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tools are placed on the interior wall behind the McLaren. Their proportions seem accurate relative to the car, and they appear attached to the wall without any sign of floating or clipping through surfaces. The apparent accurate positioning suggests intentional placement respecting the scene's integrity.",

      "question": "Is the laser-etched cityscape silhouette positioned at a consistent depth behind the car and display case, with no overlapping or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape silhouette appears laser-etched on the wall behind the display case. The depth and placement need consideration to ensure no overlapping or clipping with the car or case. The visual clues demonstrate consistency in its positioning and no signs of clipping indicate a proper execution respecting the spatial integrity of the image.",
