      "question": "Does the glass container maintain the original circular shape and proportions of the compass body, with no warped edges or irregular thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the glass container clearly retains the circular shape and proportions of the original compass. The edges appear uniformly thick and there are no visible warps, maintaining the structural integrity and symmetry. This assessment is based on the visual cues that show consistent curves and proportions similar to compass designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle centered within the glass container, aligned with the pivot point of the original needle, and does it have a smooth, continuous metallic surface without jagged edges or textural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spray nozzle is neatly centered, aligned precisely with where the pivot of the compass needle would be. The surface of the nozzle appears metallic, smooth, and polished, demonstrating continuity without any rough edges or textural inconsistencies. This conclusion is drawn from the geometric alignment and visual surface texture presented in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cap feature a detailed engraving of a vintage map that is evenly distributed across its surface, with no blurred lines or inconsistent depth, and is it attached seamlessly to the top of the glass container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap on Image B showcases a finely detailed engraving of a vintage map. The lines are crisp, well-distributed, and display a consistent depth, indicating high-quality craftsmanship. It is seamlessly attached to the top of the container, providing a harmonious transition between parts. This is evident from the visual precision and smooth attachment observed in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bronze gradient applied smoothly across the glass container and cap, with subtle variations in tone that simulate wear and light reflection, and no sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a bronze gradient that smoothly transitions across the glass container and cap. The gradient features subtle tonal variations that convincingly simulate wear and light reflection, without any abrupt color boundaries or artificial sheen. This analysis is based on the natural transition of hues and reflective qualities seen throughout the image.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branding text visible along the outer rim of the glass container, with consistent font size and spacing, and does it appear embedded into the surface without overlapping or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branding text on Image B is clearly visible along the outer rim of the container. It is presented with a consistent font size and spacing, appearing to be embedded directly into the surface rather than overlapping or floating. This is inferred from the embedded look and uniformity of text placement on the visually observed rim.",
