      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy still clearly visible as a circular object centered within the intended eye area, with white foamy textures extending outward like lashes without breaking the circle's outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifebuoy appears as the eye of a sand sculpture resembling a fish or marine creature. The orange circular object (lifebuoy) is placed where an eye would naturally be and retains a clear circular shape. Surrounding the lifebuoy, there are white foamy textures that mimic eyelashes. These textures extend outwards but do not interrupt the continuity of the circle's outline, maintaining the distinct appearance of an eye with lashes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the netting sections along the shoreline transformed into soft, undulating fin shapes with gradual transitions from mesh to organic form, lacking sharp angles or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, what appears to be netting from Image A is integrated into the fin shapes of the sand sculpture. These fins exhibit a smooth, undulating form with a gradual transition from a mesh texture to an organic shape. There are no visible sharp angles or pixelated edges, suggesting a seamless transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline curve smoothly into a continuous, rounded body shape with wave-like ridges embedded in the sand, without sudden kinks or flat regions disrupting the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoreline from Image A has been creatively reimagined into the rounded body of the sand sculpture. This body has smooth curves and wave-like ridges, consistent with a stylized marine creature. There are no abrupt kinks or flat areas that would disrupt the fluid transition of the form, indicating a harmonious and intentional design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sea-green markings distributed evenly across the sandy surface with soft, diffused edges and no visible pixels, overlays, or repeating patterns that suggest artificial addition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows sea-green markings on the sand sculpture's surface, particularly along the body. These markings are distributed evenly and have soft, diffused edges, blending naturally with the sand texture. There are no signs of pixelation, overlays, or obvious repeating patterns, which would typically suggest digital editing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eye (lifebuoy), fins (netting), and body (shoreline) align in a way that suggests a single, cohesive organism with logical proportions and no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lifebuoy serves as the eye, the netting as fins, and the shoreline as the body of a sand sculpture designed to resemble an aquatic creature. These elements are integrated thoughtfully, with each component logically proportioned and smoothly aligned, creating a cohesive and believable representation of a single organism. There are no components that appear out of place or misaligned.",
