    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red helmet and blue cap are cartoon-like features added to the paddle heads. These accessories appear to be proportionately sized to the paddles, covering just enough area to look natural. Additionally, the underlying rubber surface of the paddles seems to maintain its shape without visible distortion or warping, indicating that the accessories were applied without altering the base paddle image. This assessment is based on the visual integration of the accessories with the paddle heads.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles in Image B are rendered smoothly with consistent shading. No sharp edges or stitching lines are evident, and the colors and shadows are evenly applied, making the integration look seamless. The features look naturally part of the paddles, contributing to the coherent animated style of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a treasure chest with golden edges clearly applied to its perimeter. The gold trimming is uniform and continuous around the edges of the chest in the image. There is no evidence of the gold extending into the chest's interior or forming disconnected parts, which suggests that the application of the golden edge effect is deliberate and controlled.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble directed towards the paddles has a tail pointing specifically at them, suggesting a communication or interaction between the illustrated paddle characters. The positioning avoids overlapping with other elements of the image like the chest, maintaining clarity and preventing visual confusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background map in Image B showcases lines that are smooth and consistent, contributing to a cohesive aesthetic typical of cartoon or illustrative styles. There are no patterns of pixelation or aliasing present, and the stroke widths appear uniform throughout, indicating that the map was drawn with clean and consistent line work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paddles are depicted as characters, separate from any physical box support seen in Image A. They're playfully animated into a scene, with no need for handling slots or physical constraints. They are shown as part of an imaginative composition, thus freeing them from structural plausibility requirements.",
