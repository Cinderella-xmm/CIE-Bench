    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the shadows under and around the protruding clock consistent with its new 3D effect without creating artificial or inconsistent lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows are essential in conveying the 3D effect of the clock. The shadow angles and diffusion suggest a realistic source of light coming from the upper left, consistent with the perspective. This matches common expectations for shadow casting, where objects protruding from a surface will have shadows corresponding to light direction, ensuring the lighting looks natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the circular shape of the clock remain undistorted and geometrically sound after being altered to appear as if it protrudes from the wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular clock in Image B remains perfectly round, maintaining a clear geometric form despite its 3D effects. The edge of the clock and the clock face remain smooth and maintain consistent proportions, highlighting a credible and sound alteration process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details on the clock face been preserved, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation as a result of making it appear 3D?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the clock face possesses a smooth texture with fine details well-preserved, such as the sharpness of the clock hands. There is no noticeable pixelation or artifacts indicative of forced changes, ensuring the image maintains its resolution and natural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the clock's hands and markings retain their original clarity, style, and proportion, contributing to a natural and credible appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the clock are distinct and sharp, preserving their original style and proportions. The alignment and orientation are consistent with a clock functioning optimally, providing a credible depiction without distortion or loss of clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited clock appear to naturally integrate into the wall with a realistic thickness and depth, maintaining visual plausibility within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the clock skillfully integrated into the wall with convincing depth and thickness. The shadow and light interaction contribute to this effect, affirming a plausible 3D representation within the context of the scene by simulating genuine protrusion.",
