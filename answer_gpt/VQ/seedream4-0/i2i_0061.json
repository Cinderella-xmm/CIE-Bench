      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the watercolor effect applied across the image retain the structural coherence of the skater's pose and the ramp's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect simplifies the details yet maintains key structural integrity. The skater's pose remains coherent with the arms outstretched and the bent knees, showing movement and balance. The ramp still appears intact with its slope and defined edges. This indicates the watercolor conversion preserves the form's essential structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors used for the ground and background buildings free from unnatural textures and artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the ground and background buildings are rendered with watercolor-style brushstrokes and softened colors, contributing to the image's artistic look without introducing strange textures or digital artifacts. The effect seems intentional and does not distract from the image's overall aesthetic and coherence.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the skater’s body and clothing retained their proportions and physical rationality after applying the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skater's body and clothing in Image B are still proportionate and logically rational, mirroring how they fit together in real life. The limbs, torso, and clothing still make sense visually, maintaining realist anatomical structure though rendered in a stylized manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes remain discernible after the watercolor treatment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the watercolor effect simplifies the image, the core details of the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes appear somewhat less sharp yet still recognizable. The color block style retained in these areas allows viewers to distinguish these elements, maintaining their identity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the shapes and lines of the skater’s hands remained ergonomic and natural under the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the watercolor-styled Image B, while details are softened, the skater's hand shapes and poses appear organic and consistent with natural hand positions. The lines capture the essential ergonomics despite the lack of granular detail, indicating that the watercolor effect hasn't distorted their form.",
