      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tessellated tiles forming the sausages follow an elongated and curved arrangement, resembling the typical shape of a Vienna sausage. The tiles are arranged linearly along this curve without significant distortion or odd straightening, indicating that the overall shape of the sausages is preserved to align closely with their original depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green tiles are placed in a manner that captures the essence of lettuce leaves, featuring a ruffled, non-uniform edge and a layered appearance, much like natural lettuce. The tiles avoid blocky alignment, maintaining a sense of organic fluidity that mimics the original lettuce shape.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The egg shape in Image B is represented with a circular white tile boundary and an orange-yellow yolk that is centrally placed in relation to the white area. However, the yolk is represented with multiple tiles and doesn't have an exact circular form as Image A's yolk does, so it doesn't perfectly mirror the original proportions and orientation of the egg.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arrangement of the mosaic tiles tend to replicate the layout of the elements from Image A, with the sausages, salad, and egg placed in relative positions. However, the layout does not appear to be centrally or symmetrically balanced around any specific central point of a plate. Moreover, the spacing and proportion do not seem perfectly equal between the components.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass tiles in Image B show uniform edge definitions, clear reflections, and consistent color shading. The delineations between each tile are distinct, and reflections appear to contribute to a subtle visual effect, without any noticeable artifacts like blurring or jagged lines.",
