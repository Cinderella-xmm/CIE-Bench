      "question": "Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modification transforms sections of the building into a robot-like structure with appendages resembling arms. These appendages, formed from the building's balconies and other architectural elements, appear to have been carefully crafted to maintain consistent proportions. The joints transition smoothly from the core structure to the appendages without abrupt angles or jagged edges, which is typical of a well-executed mechanical design. Considering common mechanical aesthetics and functional designs for robotic limbs, the implementation shows a dedication to proportion and continuity, avoiding awkward bends that would detract from the realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's windows have been modified to include glowing panels that simulate technological interfaces. These panels maintain a uniform distribution, integrated into window positions, which suggests careful placement in respect to the original structure. The light emission appears to blend uniformly with surrounding surfaces, avoiding any harsh edges or pixelation that would suggest a poorly executed digital overlay. The choice of soft glow and precise alignments ensures harmony with the existing architecture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, circuit-like patterns are visible, enhancing the mechanical theme of the building's transformation. These circuits are strategically placed on structural lines such as edges and corners, supporting the visual narrative of functionality and complexity akin to modern robotics. The lines maintain consistent thickness and color, adhering tightly to plausible mechanical design principles rather than appearing as random or fragmented overlays that would disrupt the continuity of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dynamic parts of the structure, including the arm-like extensions, convincingly connect to the main body of the building, according to realistic engineering design principles. They exhibit visible mechanical links that suggest feasible pivot points, vital for suggesting function and mobility in robotic adaptations. There are no signs of floating or misaligned components, which would be evident if the components lacked logical attachment or seemed impractically positioned in terms of engineering and design logic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the buildingâ€™s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot-like structure demonstrates exposed gears that are positioned at junctions where mechanical forces would logically be transferred, emphasizing the functional aspect of the design. These gears are scaled proportionately considering the overall dimensions of the modified building, contributing to a balanced aesthetic and realism within the mechanical transformation. They align well with surrounding elements, neither appearing randomly oversized nor spatially misaligned, which adds to the seamless integration of the building's new mechanical form.",
