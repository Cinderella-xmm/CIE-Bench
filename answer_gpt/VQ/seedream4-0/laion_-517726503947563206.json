    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the edited ship with a crystal-like hull, having an iridescent appearance. The surface of the hull appears smooth and exhibits a consistent translucency with color shifts, without any obvious blocky or repeated patterns. Common knowledge about crystal structures would anticipate natural variations in translucency and color, supporting this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ship's windows have been transformed into gem-like shapes. These faceted shapes are depicted with sharp edges and consistent depth, reflecting light in a way that mimics natural gems. This aligns with common perceptions of gemstones having precise facets for optimal light reflection.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The deck surfaces in Image B exhibit structured pathways made of crystal elements. They are continuous, without any visible floating elements, cracks, or abrupt transitions, which suggests a cohesive crystalline transformation maintaining a seamless appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The superstructure in Image B is depicted as angular and faceted crystal forms, maintaining clean edges and correct proportions. There are no signs of warped or collapsed geometry, indicating a successful transformation into the crystalline form, matching expectations for solid crystal structures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been edited to appear more minimalistic, with distant islands softened but still present. The transition between the water and the sky is smooth, with consistent brightness across the scene, avoiding any visual mismatches or breaks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface, with no parts appearing to float or having a misaligned base. The ship maintains proper scale relative to the water and horizon, indicating a coherent integration into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examination of the ship in Image B, the crystal surfaces are clear of repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects. The crystal textures and edges appear sharply defined, suggesting a high-quality synthesis without digital artifacts.",
