      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystalline hair of the water spirit follow the natural downward trajectory of the original waterfall, maintaining smooth, continuous flow lines that align with the surrounding rock contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the crystalline hair of the water spirit seems to correspond to the path of the waterfall in Image A, with a gentle and sophisticated flow that adapts to the natural contours of the rocks around it. The visual representation cleverly enhances the original vertical flow with smooth continuity and integrates into the environment without disrupting its natural slope.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminescent blue hue of the water spirit evenly distributed and softly blended into the surrounding gray and dark rock surfaces without sharp edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent blue hue of the water spirit in Image B is evenly distributed around the spirit form, although there are portions where the glow appears slightly more pronounced against the darker rocks, suggesting a slight deviation from a purely smooth blend. Some edges of the spirit show luminescence transitioning without sharp edges, but not entirely devoid of stronger contrast where the blue meets darker areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine-like appendages have consistent leaf shapes, spacing, and textures that match the surrounding vegetation, and do they grow naturally from the spiritâ€™s body without floating or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the vine-like appendages from the water spirit show coherent integration into its design, with leaf shapes and textures consistent with nearby vegetation. However, discrepancies appear in spaced vine extensions that deviate slightly from the natural growth pattern and may seem somewhat afloat. The design cleverly attempts natural assimilation but is hindered by artificial spacing.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing basin reflect light in a way that matches the direction of the falling water and surrounding environment, showing coherent wave patterns and no flat or uniform glow that contradicts natural light behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing basin in Image B effectively captures and redirects light, mimicking the dynamics of light reflection found in a natural water body. The basin exhibits concentric wave patterns that correlate with the spirit's emergence from water, accurately approving light direction from both spirit and environment with variance, ensuring non-uniformity that aligns with natural light behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystalline surfaces of the spirit composed of clear, defined facets with realistic light refraction and shadowing, avoiding pixelation, smudging, or repetitive patterns that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, careful examination of the crystalline surfaces of the water spirit reveals well-defined facets that effectively capture and refract light, creating shadows that mimic real-life crystal structures. This design avoids evident pixelation, smudging, or repetitive digital patterns, instead showcasing a refined and intricate portrayal consistent with realistic gem qualities.",
