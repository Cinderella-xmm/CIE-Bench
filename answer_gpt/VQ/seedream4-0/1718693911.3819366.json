    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the cat’s body are delineated by continuous and uniform bold lines that clearly follow the natural silhouette, commonly seen in digital art or illustrations. The absence of distortion or gaps in these lines supports the purposeful artistic style used in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses have a flat orange color, lacking any reflection or gradient, which aligns with the artistic style that emphasizes flat colors and uniformity in illustration. The shape and position seem consistent with Image A, likely retaining its location on the cat's face.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sky, ocean, and sand background composed of solid color blocks with stark divisions, typical in illustrations without blended or natural gradients. This creates an abstract effect in place of textures or natural transitions seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The harness in Image B uses a smooth gradient fill, which contrasts with realistic fabric textures. Shadows under the cat are composed of gradient colors, characteristic of stylistic shading techniques in digital illustrations, as opposed to realistic light-based shading in photographic images like Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B predominantly uses bold colors such as red, blue, and yellow for rendering major elements, a common illustrative technique to achieve a striking and vibrant aesthetic. However, examining details such as the harness, there appear to be additional tones, suggesting the presence of other colors beyond the primary palette.",
