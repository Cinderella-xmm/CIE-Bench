      "question": "Does the chibi-style elephant maintain its identifiable traits like tusks and large ears without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style elephant is a cartoonish representation, which means features like tusks and large ears are stylized but still recognizable.

      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the elephant's skin accurately represented in the chibi-style 3D rendering without any loss or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style elephant is designed to be smooth and simplified, which is typical in cartoon renditions. While the texture is not detailed like a real elephant's skin, it aligns with the chibi aesthetic. Therefore, the lack of realistic skin texture is a stylistic choice, not an unnatural appearance.",
