    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the animal consist of small, uniformly sized glossy ceramic tiles arranged in a consistent pattern that follows the contours of the original form without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal's body is covered with small, uniformly sized ceramic tiles. The tiles are glossy and organized in a consistent pattern that follows its contours, reminiscent of mosaic art. There is no visible misalignment or gaps between the tiles, indicating high attention to detail in the arrangement. This observation relies on a general understanding of mosaic tile work, which typically aims for uniformity and precision.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes composed of precisely shaped tiles forming distinct white sclera and black pupils, maintaining their original size and position relative to the snout and head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are created using precisely cut tiles: distinct white sclera and black pupils are evident and maintain their original size and position relative to the snout and head, as seen in typical animal representations. This is based on the common design approach where eyes retain consistent attributes for recognition and expression purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the stripes across the body maintain uniform width and spacing, with clear transitions between vibrant orange and deep black tiles that match the original pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the stripes across the body with a consistent width and spacing. The transition between vibrant orange and deep black tiles is clear, matching the pattern that resembles typical tiger-like markings. This is in alignment with the usual expectation for maintaining visual consistency in patterned tile designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the animal a textured sandy platform with visible granular detail and subtle moisture variation, providing a tactile contrast to the smooth mosaic tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal stands on a textured sandy platform, which shows visible granular detail. This creates a contrast to the smooth surface of the mosaic tiles on the animal, adding realism and depth to the image. The presence of moisture variation is typical in images depicting beach scenes, where sand often appears with textures reflecting varying moisture levels.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the animal smoothly contoured with no jagged edges, distorted shapes, or missing tiles that would suggest structural inconsistency or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs and joints of the animal are smoothly contoured and fully tiled, without any jagged edges or missing tiles. This smooth contouring is indicative of the attention to detail often found in high-quality mosaic work, ensuring a seamless appearance without structural inconsistencies.",
