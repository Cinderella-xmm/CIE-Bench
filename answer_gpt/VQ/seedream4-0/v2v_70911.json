      "question": "Does the crack on the Axe container appear natural and maintain the structural integrity of the container without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Axe container has visible cracks on its surface. These cracks are designed to give the appearance of the container breaking open, which aligns with the intended surreal or fantastical effect of the image. Considering their exaggerated nature, they do not appear natural in the context of a structurally sound container, as they suggest significant damage that might compromise integrity. Cracks like these are interruptions in the smoothness and continuity of a real object's structure, which would usually be smoother and without such visible damage unless intentionally stylized for an artistic or conceptual effect.",

      "question": "Does the miniature nebula inside the container blend naturally with the interior of the container and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebula in Image B is vibrant and highly stylized, taking up the full opening of the container. It is visually distinct from what would normally be expected inside such a product container, suggesting intentional design for an imaginative presentation. While the colors and brightness are striking, they do not blend naturally with the container, as nebulae are typically found in space, highlighting a contrast between the fantastical space element and the ordinary product packaging. This stylistic choice is aimed more at capturing attention rather than maintaining realism.",

      "question": "Are the cosmic dust and gases within the nebula detailed and textured, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the nebula is rich in color, featuring reds, pinks, and whites, with a detailed spiral structure that resembles common artistic depictions of galaxies or nebulae. The image resolution appears high, maintaining clarity and texture within the swirl of cosmic elements, and no obvious pixelation or unnatural artifacts are visible. Overall, the nebula is presented with enough detail to appear high quality and visually appealing.",

      "question": "Does the size and shape of the nebula fit naturally within the container's opening, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebula fills the opening of the container as seen in Image B, and is deliberately exaggerated beyond what can realistically fit inside such a container. The nebula's expansive display transcends the boundaries of the container's opening, contributing to a fantastical presentation rather than a natural fit. Structural consistency is not maintained in realistic terms due to the nature of nebulae and the size limitation of the container, which is part of the design's intent to surprise and captivate rather than maintain credibility.",

      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues in the nebula consistent with the label design and contribute to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors within the nebula—fiery reds and energetic pink hues—are consistent with the label's design tones. This color harmony integrates well aesthetically, linking the contents visually to the outer design elements. However, the term 'natural appearance' might be misleading, as while colors are harmonized, the nebula itself is far from a natural product element. The consistency lies in the thematic color match rather than natural realism. Thus, the image achieves internal color consistency, though not necessarily a natural appearance overall.",
