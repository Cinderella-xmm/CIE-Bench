      "question": "Does the characterâ€™s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is depicted in a cartoon style, which typically features smooth lines and exaggerated proportions. Nonetheless, the face maintains symmetry with clearly defined facial features such as the nose, eyes, and mouth. Natural proportions are kept throughout the design, showcasing smooth contours without distortion. The features are well-aligned and consistent with cartoon art styles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the book in a precise geometric form with accurate proportions that resemble real-world books. The pages are evenly aligned, without any visible warping or distortion. The edges and thickness of the pages are consistent, complying with typical characteristics of books, ensuring realistic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeves are illustrated with a fabric-like texture and natural draping patterns expected in textile behavior. The folds and lighting are consistent with gravity, maintaining realistic shadow depth and textile contours. This gives the depiction of sleeves plausible appearance consistent with fabric drapery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The button filigree details in Image B are well-designed, showcasing clear, smooth rendering without any artifacts such as jagged edges. The integration is seamless, and the reflections are consistent with button design, showcasing high-level detail retention in a cartoon style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the library shelves are artistically reimagined as a wooden frame with consistent wood grain visible throughout. Edge alignment and depth cues are maintained, ensuring spatial logic without broken geometry, preserving visually coherent wooden texture layout.",
