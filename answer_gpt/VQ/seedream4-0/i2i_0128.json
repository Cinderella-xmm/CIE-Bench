      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard seamlessly blend with the surrounding environment, avoiding any unnatural glow or oversaturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard appear vivid and intense. They provide a strong contrast with the otherwise darker surroundings, creating a distinct visual effect. However, examining the interaction between the neon light and the rest of the image, the lights do not appear oversaturated or excessively bright, implying an appropriate intensity that blends well with the scene. The neon glow does not disrupt the overall coherence of the image. Thus, the lights are well integrated without any unnatural appearance.",

      "question": "Are the glowing fingertips free of unnatural textures, keeping the hands' structure realistic and preserving the natural texture and curvature of the fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing fingertips have a subtle neon glow due to the reflected light from the keyboard. The fingers maintain a natural look, with realistic curvature and texture, and the glow does not appear to introduce any distortion or unnatural textures. This is indicated by the smooth gradient of light and the consistency in skin detail, preserving the realistic appearance of the hands.",

      "question": "Does the keyboard retain its original shape and functionality, with no visible distortion or breaking of keys despite the addition of neon lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the neon lighting effect is prominent, especially on the keys, there is no visible distortion or alteration in the shape and form of the keyboard keys. They appear well-defined and consistent with the expected shape and arrangement of a normal keyboard. The addition of neon lighting does not compromise the structural integrity or functionality, as observed from the maintained layout and dimensions.",

      "question": "Have the details on the laptopâ€™s surface and key caps preserved their sharpness, with no blurring or pixelation caused by the added neon effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of neon lighting, the surface of the laptop and the individual key caps remain sharp and clear, demonstrating that there is no significant blurring or pixelation induced by the neon effect. The details, such as the shapes of the keys and the laptop's edge, are preserved, indicating the image's clarity despite the additional lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the blue-purple neon lights on the keyboard interact correctly with the rest of the scene's lighting, creating believable reflections or shadows where appropriate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue-purple neon lights provide a realistic interaction with the scene by casting appropriate glows and reflections on nearby objects, such as the fingers and the laptop's surface. This indicates a correct application of lighting techniques, aligning the neon lights accurately with environmental elements. The lighting's consistency with shadows and reflected colors on the hands and laptop lends authenticity to the scene.",
