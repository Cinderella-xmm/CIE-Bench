        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gem-studded scepter held by the character appears to be proportionally accurate and well-sized relative to the hand.

      "question": "Does the velvet cape exhibit natural draping behavior with realistic folds and shadows, and does it avoid unnatural intersections or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet cape in Image B shows a natural draping behavior with folds that follow the flow of the fabric. The shadows cast by these folds enhance the realism of the cape, suggesting weight and texture. The cape appears to be grounded on the character's shoulders and does not exhibit any unnatural intersections or floating segments, which supports the image's consistency and quality.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rolling hills and distant castle are smoothly integrated into the scene. The lighting provides a uniform glow that ties the scene together, with shadows falling naturally on the landscape. There are no glaring sharp edges or inconsistencies in color transitions, contributing to a cohesive environment.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's right hand in Image B holding the scepter is accurately depicted. The fingers are properly shaped, with correct joint alignment that reflects realistic hand anatomy. The skin texture is consistent, and there are no signs of deformation or extra digits, presenting a precise and natural representation.",
