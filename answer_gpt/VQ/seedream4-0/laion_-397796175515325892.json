      "question": "Are the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines smooth and continuous without jagged breaks or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's spire and rooflines are depicted with smooth and continuous lines as part of an illustration. This smoothness is typical of digital artwork where the emphasis is on clean, precise lines rather than the unevenness that might occur in a photograph (such as Image A) due to structural details or lighting. The edges appear intentional and uniform, indicating design consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the left and right halves of the church’s façade mirror each other exactly, causing any misalignment in window positions or wall contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's façade seems well-balanced, with symmetry being a key aspect of the illustration style. This style often emphasizes harmony and balance, avoiding misalignment typical in real-life discrepancies seen in photographs. Therefore, the halves of the façade are likely mirrored exactly, avoiding any noticeable misalignment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the metallic gold accent on the spire have a uniform, reflective appearance without clashing textures or unnatural glow spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accent on the spire has a uniform color and appearance characteristic of digital illustrations. The reflective appearance is controlled and looks consistent, without clashing textures or glow spots typical in real-life material photography. The illustration maintains a streamlined look, characteristic of artistic rendering.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the height of the spire proportionally balanced with the width and height of the church’s main body, avoiding extreme vertical stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spire maintains a proportion that appears realistically in balance with the main body of the church. Artistic illustrations typically preserve or purposefully exaggerate certain architectural features, but in this case, there seems to be no extreme vertical stretching, indicating proportional balance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the celestial background blend seamlessly with the top edge of the church and surrounding sky, without abrupt color shifts or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The celestial background in Image B is seamlessly integrated with the top edge of the church. The starry sky is consistent throughout the panels, transitioning smoothly into the space around the structure without abrupt shifts or disjointed elements. This is consistent with digital artwork where layers are carefully composed.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the window frames, arch designs, and roof tile patterns still visible and clearly defined in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames, arch designs, and roof tile patterns are defined clearly within the constraints of the artistic illustration medium, which focuses on stylized detail rather than photographic precision. The patterns are intentionally drawn as part of the building's depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {

      "question": "Is the artwork fully contained within the matte black frame, with no visible clipping or stretching at the borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the church artwork fully contained within the matte black frame of the triptych. The borders are clean without any clipping or stretching, as the illustration is designed to fit perfectly within the provided frame spaces, ensuring the entirety of the artwork is visible.",
