    "Question": "Q1: Does the character maintain its structural consistency as a chibi version, with no disproportionate or overly exaggerated body parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi style, which naturally involves exaggerated head size compared to the body, a stylistic choice commonly used for chibi characters.

There are no visible disproportionate or overly exaggerated features beyond what is typical for a chibi design.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the shell-shaped base seamlessly integrated with the keychain, avoiding any evident artifacts or unnatural boundaries?",

    "explanation": "Image B shows the character standing with both feet firmly on the shell-shaped base, suggesting a stable and balanced stance.
