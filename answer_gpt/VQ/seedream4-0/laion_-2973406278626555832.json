    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1 features a laboratory background which should visually integrate with the figure in the foreground. Consistent lighting and depth alignment mean the shadows, highlights, and scale must match to avoid elements appearing out of place or disconnected. The lighting in Panel 1 appears uniformly distributed, and the laboratory items and background are proportionate and reasonably aligned with the foreground figure, suggesting there are no floating or disconnected elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B's Panel 1, the positioning and grip around the vape device should be natural, with the fingers comfortably wrapped around it. The angle and proportion of the device appear consistent with a realistic hold, and the fingers seem naturally aligned without signs of distortion or unnatural compression/stretching.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To evaluate the device's visual quality in Panel 1 of Image B, check for glass clarity, reflection consistency, and clear labeling. The vape device's glass appears transparent and displays reflections that add to the realistic appearance; labeling is legible and lacks pixelation or blurring, avoiding any unnatural highlights that could detract from realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 in Image B is dedicated to illustrating the internal structure of the vape device. The coil placement, liquid positions, and airflow path should respect logical engineering principles. The arrangement shows the coil above the liquid, with the airflow path depicted as continuous and realistic without broken lines or improbable geometry that would suggest error in the construction illustrations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating text placement involves ensuring bubbles or labels don't obstruct significant visual areas, such as clothing features, and must be easy to read without forced position. In Image B, the text bubbles and labels appear carefully placed to avoid obstruction and are aligned for an intuitive reading direction, maintaining clarity without clipping parts of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 and Panel 3 of Image B, the hand grip around the vape device should appear anatomical, indicating natural joint bends with all five fingers correctly formed. The fingers show a realistic bend and proportional length, with no visible deformities that would suggest unnatural fusion or elongation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is there a clean boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, with no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between photographic elements and illustrated panels in Image B should exhibit smooth boundaries without conspicuous seams, outlines, or color discrepancies. The boundaries appear sharp and consistent, facilitating a cohesive transition between photographic and illustrated components with no apparent mismatches.",
