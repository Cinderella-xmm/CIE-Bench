    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden wand have smooth, reflective surfaces with consistent lighting and shadows that match the surrounding environment, and is it properly connected to the reel and the fisherman’s hand without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden wand exhibits a reflective surface that is consistent with the lighting and shadows of the environment. The wand is properly attached to the reel and the fisherman’s hand, maintaining a seamless connection without any visible gaps or distortions, suggesting good integration into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the hat and plaid shirt visibly enhanced but still consistent with real fabric appearance, with no pixelation, stretching, or broken patterns in the weave or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the textures on the hat and plaid shirt do not display any signs of pixelation, stretching, or broken patterns. The fabric appearance remains consistent with reality, suggesting that the enhancement maintains a realistic representation of woven fabric.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the magical ripples originate from the tip of the wand and spread outward in continuous, concentric patterns that interact naturally with the water surface and reflections, without floating or disconnected wave segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magical ripples clearly start from the wand’s tip and travel outward in orderly concentric patterns. The interaction with the water surface is natural, with waves integrating seamlessly within the reflections without any floating or disconnected segments.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame positioned around the image with correct perspective, consistent texture, and shadows that align with the scene’s lighting, and do the embossed pine tree details appear three-dimensional without distortion or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wooden frame correctly positioned in alignment with the scene’s perspective. The texture and shadows of the frame are consistent with the lighting in the image, and the pine tree details appear appropriately three-dimensional and free of distortion or clipping.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the fisherman’s hands show five fingers each with natural joint positioning and skin texture, and is his facial structure preserved without distortion in both the original and reflected image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fisherman’s hands clearly display five fingers each with realistic joint positioning and natural-looking skin texture. The facial structure in both the original and its reflection is preserved adequately without visible distortion, aside from the intentional face blurring.",
