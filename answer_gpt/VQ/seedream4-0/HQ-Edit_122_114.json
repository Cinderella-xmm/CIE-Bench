      "question": "Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the cogs and gears appear systematically arranged, and their alignment and interlocking results in a continuous mechanical design. This impression is formed since each cog meshes with another without visible gaps, maintaining harmony in their geometric continuity. By combining this observation with knowledge of mechanical design, which often requires interlocked parts for operational coherence, the conclusion is that the arrangement in Image B adheres to these principles.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper pipes are visibly laid over the roof edges with consistent depth, and their design follows the typical route of plumbing or mechanical installations where pipes are securely attached. The thickness is uniform without abrupt changes, and their trajectory does not manifest any unrealistic suspensions or bends, reflecting believable mechanical installation knowledge.",

      "question": "Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic plates on the stork are neatly arranged to mimic the bird's anatomy, specifically the contour and shape of its wings and body. The arrangement avoids overlap or gaps that could compromise the anatomical coherence. The plates appear segmented to allow for articulation, aligned with the possibility of mechanical movement akin to real feathers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical joints on the stork's neck, wings, and legs are designed to match the articulation points found in real birds, where movement is naturally expected. They aren't distorted or awkwardly positioned, suggesting a thoughtful understanding of biomechanics, which ensures the alignment of mechanical parts with anatomical function.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The integration of mechanical elements with the wooden house in Image B reflects proportional harmony, as the size of the cogs and pipes are appropriately scaled to fit within the dimensions of the structure, maintaining balance visually. Additionally, no components appear suspended or unsupported, ensuring that the integration respects both mechanical design and architectural coherence.",
