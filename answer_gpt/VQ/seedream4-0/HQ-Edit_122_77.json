      "question": "Do the vine-like tendrils follow the natural contour of the head without floating or breaking apart at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine-like tendrils extend seamlessly from the head and follow its natural contours. They appear well-integrated into the scene as they don't seem to break apart or float unnaturally. This gives the impression that the tendrils are part of the figure's adornment, suggesting a strong design intent to have them flow and align with the head's surface.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the blur over the face area, Image B shows laurel leaves and flowers embedded within the hair so that they naturally integrate into the overall composition.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emerald green tunic displays realistic fabric folds and shading, reflecting the movements and stance of the figure.

      "question": "Are the twisted olive trees and marble fragments positioned at a plausible distance from the subject, with correct perspective and no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts twisted olive trees and marble fragments positioned in a manner that respects perspective. The elements maintain proportional distance relative to the subject and environment; thus, they appear firmly grounded, without misalignment or floating, contributing to a cohesive scene setup.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows on the subject in Image B are coherent with the ambient light source in the background. The natural diffused light appears to affect both the subject's attire and the surrounding elements, resulting in consistent shading and reflections that harmonize with the scene, thus contributing to a realistic depiction.",
