    "Question": "Q1: Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures are finished in a reflective gold color, which commonly indicates a smooth and polished surface. To judge smoothness, look for uniformity in surface texture without abrupt interruptions or digital noise. The figures in Image B appear to be uniformly reflective, suggesting no digital artifacting or unnatural textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central glass structure is characterized by a clear and green-tinted panel that should realistically transmit light and remain sharp along its edges for it to appear authentic. The panel exhibits continuous edges, indicating no digital errors or abrupt color transitions at the boundaries that would suggest a poorly rendered image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text \"Savanna Essence\" clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, one should observe the clarity and alignment of the text \"Savanna Essence\" on the base of the cheetah figure to ensure it's sharply defined. It should be centered and along the same plane as the base, without signs of digital blurring or misalignment, which might have occurred during editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",
    "explanation": "The figures in Image B are expected to match the original anatomical posture, implying consistency in limb positioning and torso alignment. By observing the figures, one can conclude from their symmetry and alignment with the original figure's position that no anatomical deviations such as limb elongation or compression have occurred.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, symmetry in alignment can be judged by examining the positions of the two cheetah figures in relation to the central glass façade. Furthermore, consistency in shadow direction and surface reflection indicates alignment with the lighting, as shadows should logically extend from the same angle. The symmetrical placement and uniform shadowing observed support correct alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
