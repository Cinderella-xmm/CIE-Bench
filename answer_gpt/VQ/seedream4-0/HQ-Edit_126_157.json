      "question": "Does the boat exhibit consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns and no repeating or unnatural surface artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat appears to have textures that mimic aged wood with visible grain patterns. The visual cues suggest an intended artsy appearance, resembling wood carvings with intentional patterns, rather than organic textures. The grain patterns are consistent throughout the boat's surface, although they have a stylized, carved look. Observing closely, the consistency and smoothness suggest artistic representation rather than natural aged wood particles as seen in authentic material. Therefore, the design is purposefully stylized with no apparent unnatural surface artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered with smooth pastel blue gradients that transition naturally without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hills are depicted with smooth pastel blue gradients, exhibiting gentle transitions between different shades. The absence of sharp boundaries or pixelation in these gradient transitions suggests an intentional design for a soft, artistic backdrop that is coherent and visually pleasing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small, clear droplet-like etchings on the water surface that resemble ripples without disrupting the reflection or causing visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays deliberate etchings on the water surface that resemble droplets or ripples. These etchings are small, consistent, and do not disrupt the reflection or cause visual distortion. They appear as part of the artistic design intended to mimic the texture of water with slight ripples.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a hand-carved wooden frame surrounding the scene with realistic texture, depth, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frame surrounding the scene is depicted with hand-carved style, evident from the detailed patterns around its edges. This frame exhibits realistic texture and depth, illustrating structural coherence typical of carved wood designs. The frame completes the artistic representation, enhancing the depth of the overall scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills arranged in layered 3D cutouts with correct spatial depth and no misalignment or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the scene with a layered 3D effect, where elements like the boat, water, and hills are organized in a manner that reflects a correct spatial depth. The arrangement suggests a deliberate emphasis on dimensionality without misalignment or floating artifacts, maintaining a coherent visual structure.",
