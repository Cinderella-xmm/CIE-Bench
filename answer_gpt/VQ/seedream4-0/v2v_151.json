      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger in Image B is depicted with smooth textures and consistent styling indicative of 3D cartoon modeling. The details such as the tiger's stripes, facial features, and the consistent shiny texture of the hat and skateboard suggest a well-executed design without any glaring textures or detail issues. The smooth gradients and consistent lighting enhance the visual credibility of the character. Based on these observations, the structural integrity and detail preservation are maintained effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the whimsical park backdrop with soft pastel hues, cherry blossom trees, and rose petals appear photorealistic and integrate naturally with the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop of Image B features cherry blossom trees, a flower-lined path, and scattered rose petals, all rendered in soft pastel hues. While these elements are beautifully stylized, their integration with the chibi-style cartoon tiger follows a consistent stylistic theme rather than a photorealistic approach. The environment complements the cartoonish character but does not strive for photorealism as the tiger and the background maintain a cohesive cartoonish aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the romantic floral arch in the distance enhance the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral arch in Image B, adorned with flowers, complements the scene by providing depth and context to the park setting. It is consistent with the whimsical and colorful theme of the scene, enhancing the romantic and peaceful ambiance. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistent elements that disrupt cohesion, ensuring a visually seamless integration with the rest of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style 3D cartoon tiger holding the skateboard realistic and does the action of holding the skateboard appear physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger is stylized in a chibi manner, characterized by a larger head and smaller body, which is common in cartoon design. The tiger's short arms, typical of a chibi style, are holding the skateboard. While not anatomically realistic, the design is plausible within the stylized cartoon context and does not appear awkward. The skateboard is proportionate to the tiger, supporting the plausibility of the action.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a cohesive scene where all elements, from the cartoon tiger to the park's background, share a complementary style and thematic color palette. The smooth rendering, consistent lighting, and lack of visible artifacts contribute to an authentic appearance in the context of cartoon artistry. The elements blend harmoniously, ensuring a natural and seamless composition.",
