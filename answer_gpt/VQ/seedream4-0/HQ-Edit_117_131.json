      "question": "Does the pastel purple fur with teal accents maintain natural fur texture and gradient transitions across the body, particularly on the tail and back, without visible color blocking or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish manner, which usually involves a more simplified approach to texture and color compared to naturalistic depictions like in Image A. The purple fur with teal accents shows a smooth transition of colors, characteristic of a cartoon style, rather than the varied and intricate textures found in natural fur. In this context, the color transitions appear deliberate as part of an artistic choice, not unnatural smoothing or color blocking. The style matches typical cartoon characteristics.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the backpack positioned correctly on the squirrel’s back without deforming its posture or causing unnatural bulges in the fur, and does it display consistent material texture and shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon squirrel features a backpack that appears to be integrated smoothly with the body, maintaining the overall posture and shape of the squirrel. There are no visible deformations or unnatural bulges in the fur where the backpack intersects, which is a common technique in cartoon illustrations to avoid unnecessary complexity. The backpack also seems to have a consistent cartoon material texture and displays shadowing that fits the environment lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glasses positioned symmetrically over the squirrel’s eyes with proper reflection details and soft shadows, and do they not distort the eye area or appear disproportionately large?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glasses in Image B are placed symmetrically over the squirrel’s eyes, and their size seems proportionate within the context of a cartoonish character. They appear in alignment without causing any distortion of the facial features. Since cartoons often exaggerate features for expressive effect, their size and fitting ensure they do not overpower or distort the eye area, and the reflections and shadowing are suitably illustrated and typical for the style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the integration of the squirrel into the new forest background seamless, with no visible edge artifacts, mismatched lighting, or floating elements around the feet and tail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the squirrel is digitally illustrated within a forest scene, and both the character and the background share the same art style. There are no visible edge artifacts or mismatches in lighting; the entire composition shares consistent lighting, which is critical in cartoon illustrations to create a unified scene. The feet and tail appropriately connect and shadow the ground, suggesting good integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cartoonish flowers and mushrooms positioned at plausible distances from the squirrel, showing correct occlusion and depth cues, and do they have consistent textures and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish elements like flowers and mushrooms are strategically positioned to establish a sense of depth in the scene, a common technique in cartoon art. Correct occlusion is apparent, as elements that should be in front or behind others in perspective are accurately displayed. The textures and shading of these elements are uniform, matching the cartoon's stylistic cohesiveness, which aids in the overall spatial perception.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the title banner positioned above the squirrel at a reasonable height, with legible text and soft shadows that match the scene’s lighting, without overlapping key elements like the squirrel’s head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner is placed above the squirrel, at a height that does not interfere with the main focus, which is the squirrel itself. The text on the banner is clear and legible, aiding in conveying the message of the scene. Shadows match the scene's lighting, providing additional depth without overpowering the primary subject or any critical components of the illustration, such as the squirrel’s head or other elements.",
