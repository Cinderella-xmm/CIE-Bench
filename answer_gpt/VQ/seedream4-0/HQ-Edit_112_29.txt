    "Question": "Q1: Does the ship retain its original structural shape and proportion when rendered as part of a spherical globe, without visible warping or stretching of the hull or sails?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ship inside the glass dome maintains its fundamental structure and proportions, resembling closely the ship depicted in Image A. There is no evident distortion or warping; its hull and sails appear to be portrayed accurately without being affected by the spherical shape of the globe. The ship fits within the dome naturally, suggesting careful design to avoid unnatural stretching.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and does the wooden base display natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings without pixelation or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B demonstrates a high level of transparency, allowing the viewer to see the ship and surrounding elements clearly, while capturing reflections that enhance its realistic appearance. The wooden base beneath the dome exhibits detailed engravings of a compass design. The wood grain appears natural and continuous, with no visible signs of pixelation or repeated textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the sea creatures clearly visible beneath the ship, properly scaled, and positioned in a manner consistent with underwater motion, without appearing floating unnaturally or distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sea creatures beneath the ship are well-defined, with appropriate scaling relative to the ship's size. Their positioning suggests natural underwater movement, aligning with the currents around the ship. There is no evidence of them appearing to float unnaturally or being distorted, indicating careful attention to their integration within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the sails exhibit fine fabric details such as wrinkles and weave patterns that align with the lighting direction and do not show unnatural seams or repeating patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays sails with intricate details that include visible fabric texture, such as wrinkles and weave patterns, which correspond with the direction of the lighting. These details enhance the authenticity of the sails without showing any unnatural seams or repeating patterns, suggesting a high level of detail in the rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the internal clouds smoothly shaped and distributed within the dome without clipping into the ship or glass surface, and do they have soft edges and luminous quality consistent with being lit from above?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds within the dome have a smooth and flowing shape, distributed evenly in the space around the ship without intersecting its structure or the dome's glass surface. Their edges are soft and they exhibit a luminous quality that aligns with the overhead lighting, contributing to a visually pleasing and realistic atmosphere.",
    "answer": "Yes"
