      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi style inherently features a larger head in proportion to the body to achieve a cute effect in design. The facial features remain intact and stylized in a simplified manner. The curls of the hair maintain their rounded and voluminous appearance, which fits the stylized proportions of the chibi design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the black outlines uniformly thick and cleanly separated from internal details such as hair, skin, and armor engravings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi keychain features bold black outlines that are characteristic of enamel keychains. These outlines are consistent in thickness and clearly define the boundaries between different elements such as the hair, skin, and armor engravings, providing a strong separation of details.",

      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armor of the chibi figure appears glossy and smooth, with reflections represented as clean highlights. The color transitions across the armor's surface are even, and there is no visible pixelation or repeating patterns, which is typical for high-quality enamel coloring used in accessories.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the design of the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate on the chibi figure is symmetrical and well-defined, with precise edges. There are no noticeable geometric distortions, maintaining the integrity and aesthetic symmetry of the armor represented.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver chain is attached to the top of the chibi figure's head, an appropriate and logical point of attachment for a keychain. The links in the chain are uniformly shaped and appear physically connected, creating a realistic representation of a chain keychain.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a dark texture that is consistent and smooth, suggesting a velvet-like material. It lacks bright reflections or unnatural gradients, maintaining uniformity across the background surface.",
