    "Question": "Q1: Does the kawaii enamel pin design retain the basic structure of the amphitheater, such as the tiered seating and arches, without introducing distortions like broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the enamel pin design clearly retains the basic structure of the amphitheater, which includes the tiered seating and arches. The elements are stylized with colorful enamel sections, but this does not distort the geometric structure. The design retains the curvature of the seating and alignment of the arches, indicating that no fundamental distortions have been introduced. Based on this analysis, the basic structure is preserved.",
