      "question": "Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which is the edited image, the brown LEGO bricks are used to construct the body of the dresser. However, due to the nature of LEGO bricks, which are square or rectangular, achieving complete evenness in spacing and perfect alignment is challenging when creating curved surfaces. As a result, there are visible steps and some micro-gaps in the arrangement of the bricks, which contrasts with smooth surfaces in traditional wooden furniture like that in Image A. Therefore, the surface texture is not completely smooth or devoid of irregularities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front panels of the dresser are constructed using LEGO bricks to simulate a herringbone marquetry pattern. Due to the limitations of the standard shapes of LEGO pieces, the pattern appears somewhat pixelated and lacks the fluid continuity that you would expect from real woodworking. This leads to broken lines and irregular segment connections that are caused by the inherent nature of using square bricks to form complex patterns. In comparison, Image A's genuine marquetry features a continuous and highly detailed pattern which is difficult to replicate exactly with LEGO.",

      "question": "Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative gold borders are imitated using LEGO bricks. Due to the bricks' angular nature, it is difficult to achieve the fluid, curved lines present in the detailed inlay of Image A. Instead, Image B shows sharp angles and interruptions in the border flow as a consequence of sticking to a grid-like structure inherent in LEGO construction. The segmented build contrasts with the smooth, elegant curves of traditional craftsmanship seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side panels and cabriole legs are formed using a combination of sloped and standard LEGO bricks. While certain slopes allow for approximation of curves, the result still includes visible steps and a more angular appearance typical of LEGO structures, which contrasts with the seamless curves present in dedicated woodworking seen in Image A. The transition between segments is not completely smooth due to the alignment of individual bricks, leading to an angular profile.",

      "question": "Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top of the dresser is constructed with gray LEGO tiles. These tiles are designed to fit together without gaps when arranged properly. The top appears even, with tiles sitting level and closely fitted to the sides, suggesting no major misalignment or gaps in where it meets the body of the dresser. This indicates a relatively flat and clean assembly of the top surface.",
