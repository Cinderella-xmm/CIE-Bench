      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly retain their natural texture and pattern without any visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the butterfly are constructed in a pixelated, block-like style, which is characteristic of a digital, 3D model rather than a natural texture. The pixelated design is a clear deviation from a natural butterfly's pattern, which is usually smooth and contains intricate detail. This suggests that the wings do not retain the natural texture and pattern expected of a real butterfly.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the butterfly's body and wings consistent with its natural form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly maintains a symmetrical design similar to actual butterflies, with widely spread wings and a distinct body. Despite being pixelated, the proportions seem consistent with a real butterfly's shape. In Image A, the proportions and shapes show the butterfly's natural form with smooth curves and intricate detailing, while Image B mimics this symmetry and proportion although in a blocky, pixelated manner.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and shading on the butterfly in the 3D model appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shading adhere to a realistic style, showing reflections and shadows that give the butterfly depth and dimensionality. Image A displays natural, soft lighting on the butterfly, highlighting its texture and depth. Though Image B has a different texture, the lighting seems consistent and falls naturally across the butterfly, similar to the natural lighting in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the patterns on the wings and the texture of the body, been preserved without any loss or distortion in the 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns and textures on the butterfly's wings are presented in a simplified, blocky manner due to the pixelated style of the 3D model. Although it is visually appealing, this style inevitably loses the fine details and nuanced textures found in natural butterfly wings as seen in Image A, which displays detailed patterns and smooth texture.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and placement of the butterfly in the 3D model appear visually plausible and coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned similarly to Image A, with its wings spread out and placed on the edge of a wooden surface. This positioning aligns with a plausible and coherent presentation within the scene, consistent with realistic butterfly positioning. Despite the pixelated style, the butterfly remains visually plausible and coherent within its environment.",
