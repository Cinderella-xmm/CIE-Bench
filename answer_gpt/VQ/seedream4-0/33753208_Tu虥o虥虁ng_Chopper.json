    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dragon’s body follow the exact winding route of the original dirt path from the foreground to the summit without altering its course or creating unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body is clearly a large, winding figure occupying much of the hillside where the path is located in Image A. The path in Image A is a simple dirt path, while the dragon in Image B coils and bends in a serpentine fashion, which may not strictly adhere to the direct path line seen originally. This indicates that some alterations to the natural course of the path have been made to accommodate the form of the dragon, thus creating additional curves and bends.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald and orange markings on the dragon’s body smoothly rendered with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or mismatched shading compared to the surrounding terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the dragon's scales and colorations are rendered in vivid detail, with emerald and orange hues that blend smoothly into the environment. There are no visible signs of pixelation or misalignment with the surrounding natural landscape, such as jagged edges or unmatched shading, which would indicate poor integration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the twisting horns positioned at the dragon’s head near the summit aligned with the hill’s contour and free from clipping into nearby trees or appearing disconnected from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon’s head with twisting horns is positioned near the top of the ridge, aligning well with the hill's contour. The horns extend upwards smoothly without intersecting or overlapping with any surrounding trees. They appear connected to the dragon's body without signs of clipping or disconnection.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the jade-colored eyes show realistic depth and reflection, and are they proportionally sized and positioned within the dragon’s head without appearing pasted or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dragon's eyes as having a vibrant jade color that appears to have depth and natural reflection, indicative of realistic rendering. They are proportionately sized relative to the dragon's head and are correctly positioned, showing no signs of being mismatched or artificially pasted in place.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the mossy tendrils extending from the dragon’s neck seamlessly integrated with the nearby vegetation, showing consistent texture and growth direction without sharp boundaries or unnatural clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy tendrils are depicted as naturally growing from the dragon, extending towards the nearby vegetation. They are seamlessly integrated with the natural greenery of the hill, displaying a consistent texture and logical growth pattern that matches the surrounding environment, without any sharp or unnatural delineations.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the dragon’s head positioned at the correct elevation along the ridge, rising naturally from the hillside without appearing unnaturally elevated or detached from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the dragon’s head in Image B is in a natural rising posture from the hillside, blending well with the topography of the ridge. The elevation appears logical and does not give the impression of the head being unnaturally elevated or disjoined, thus maintaining coherent and realistic placement.",
