    "Question": "Q1: Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's limbs and torso are depicted in a stylized format, but they maintain a proportional relationship consistent with human anatomy. The arms are attached to the torso at the shoulders in a typical manner, and the overall proportions of torso to legs and arms are balanced. This suggests a natural articulation of joints, even within the stylized representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a cartoonish rendition, where textures are typically simplified. However, the tuxedo and fur jacket display a differentiation in their textile render through shading and contour lines, which simulate the appearance of fabric and fur, giving a sense of depth and detail suitable for stylization. This aligns with the common artistic approach in stylized illustrations to suggest texture under simplified conditions, maintaining physical plausibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the linear background design incorporates the FIA logo and sponsor names, displayed without distortion and in a legible manner. Despite simplification, the logos and text maintain the correct form and spacing, making them distinguishable and clear.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold ribbon-like border surrounding the stamp is closed and consistently thick without disruptions. It is shaped evenly to frame the stamp neatly, ensuring a tidy and complete appearance. This is in accordance with typical design principles for decorative elements in illustrations, providing a unified and finished look.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
    "explanation": "The embossed logo on the envelope in Image B is depicted with subtle shading and highlights that convey a sense of depth and texture appropriate for an embossed relief. The shadows are soft, enhancing the three-dimensional quality without appearing flat or overly artificial, aligning with typical design treatments to portray embossing on surfaces in stylized illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stamp casts a shadow that aligns with the light source and perspective of the surrounding scene, giving the appearance of attachment to the envelope's surface. The shadowing and positioning contribute to a sense of depth, making the stamp look like an integrated component of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both individuals are depicted with five fingers on each hand. The hands are stylized but maintain natural shapes and proportions that align with typical hand structure, without any deformations or missing digits. This careful attention to anatomy, even in a stylized format, retains the typical features of human hands.",
    "answer": "Yes"
