      "question": "Does the unfurled scroll form of the map maintain smooth, continuous curvature without jagged edges or distorted grid lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unfurled scroll form of the map is designed to look like an aged nautical chart unfurling over the ocean. Upon closely examining the curvature of the scroll, it maintains a smooth and consistent form, representing a classic scroll map style without any apparent jagged edges. The grid lines appear to be evenly drawn and follow the curvature naturally without distortion, suggesting a seamless integration into the overall vintage map aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spokes of the ship's wheel evenly spaced, structurally intact, and consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the original compass material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the ship's wheel's spokes are evenly spaced around the center. They maintain a consistent thickness that matches the metallic texture of the rest of the wheel and are similar in appearance to the compass shown in Image A, suggesting they share the same material and design theme. This implies that the ship's wheel is structurally sound and exhibits a coherent visual style with the original compass material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of the explorers are depicted along the map's red dotted line, which represents a travel path. The silhouettes are small and proportionate to the scale of the map. They are distinctly placed as to not overlap with key geographical labels or contours of continents, ensuring that the visual representation does not interfere with reading the map's details. This placement maintains clarity and aligns with historical travel routes along the map.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography aligned with the vintage aesthetic, free from pixelation or blurring, and positioned so that it does not obscure major elements such as the compass or continental outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in Image B is designed to complement the vintage appeal of the map, using a font style that aligns well with this theme. The text is clear, avoiding pixelation or blurring, and is strategically positioned near the top and bottom, ensuring it doesn't obscure crucial map elements like the compass or the outlines of continents, maintaining visual hierarchy and readability.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red dotted lines in Image B represent exploration paths on the map. These lines are continuous and clearly delineated without unnecessary overlaps. They carefully navigate through the map, aligning with plausible exploration routes known in historical contexts without intersecting prominent landmasses or significant graphical symbols, illustrating attentive design in path plotting.",
