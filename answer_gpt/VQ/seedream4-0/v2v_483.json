      "question": "Does the man's face maintain natural proportions and avoid distortion after being converted into a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the face has been converted into a 3D cartoon style. This involves simplifying and exaggerating certain features to fit the chibi or animated aesthetic. Generally, 3D cartoon styles retain the proportional balance of key facial features (like eye positions, mouth, and nose placements), though they may be exaggerated for effect. The style aims for artistic rather than realistic portrayal while maintaining believability in the proportions.",

      "question": "Are the textures and details of the hand holding the fan natural and free from artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the fan is rendered in a smooth, polished 3D cartoon style typical for animated characters. Such styles tend to avoid detailed skin textures and instead present clean, uniform surfaces. This aligns with common depictions in 3D animations where hands are more stylized than realistic but are free of visual noise or unintended artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the fan appear to interact naturally with the environment, without introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan is rendered as a simplified 3D model, consistent with the overall aesthetic. It appears to be proportionately structured and positioned in the hand. There are no visible glitches or distortions that would disrupt the perception of the fan as a physical object within the cartoon environment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the birthday cake and its candles retain a natural appearance and avoid obvious artifacts after the style conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cake and candles in Image B are stylized to match the 3D cartoon environment. Despite this stylization, the cake's shape is smooth, and the candles are appropriately shaped and positioned on top. The flames, though simple, are consistent with typical cartoon depictions. The transition to this style does not result in obvious artifacts or distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the balloons and candles in the festive-themed backdrop blend seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons and other backdrop elements are integrated into a festive scene typical of 3D cartoon settings. The balloons are glossy and rounded, fitting the party theme, and the candles add to the ambiance without appearing out of place. Their presence complements the focus of the image without introducing visual discord, maintaining overall scene consistency.",
