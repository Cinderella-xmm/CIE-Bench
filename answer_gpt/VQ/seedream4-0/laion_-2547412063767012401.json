    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure's armor in Image B appears to be designed to fit snugly against the natural contours of the human body, maintaining proper proportions. The elements such as the shoulder and chest plates follow a coherent geometric pattern and do not seem to exhibit any distortions or breakages. The armor design enhances the natural structure without interrupting the flow of the human form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the ocean-themed armor on the rightmost figure’s jacket smooth and continuous without visible tiling or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor textures on the rightmost figure in Image B are visually cohesive and continuous, with no abrupt pattern repetitions or misaligned textures that would suggest tiling. The blending of different sections of the armor is smooth and consistent with a natural design theme, which implies an effective texture application.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the right hand of the rightmost figure have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and joint curvature, even with armor applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rightmost figure's right hand in Image B appears to have five fingers. However, the visual details are obscured by the armor, making it difficult to clearly discern natural finger spacing and curvature. Without clear anatomical detailing visible through the armor, confirming this is challenging.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sky gradient from the horizon upward smooth and free of color banding or abrupt transitions between orange, blue, and purple hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky gradient is analyzed to be smooth, with a harmonious transition of colors from orange near the horizon to blue and purple higher up. There is no evident banding or harsh transitions between these hues, suggesting a well-rendered sky gradient without visual disruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the typography at the bottom of the image clearly legible, properly aligned, and textured with ocean-spray effects without repeating patterns or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in Image B is prominently displayed, legible, and well-aligned across the image's bottom. The ocean-spray texture applied to the text adds an effect that blends naturally without obvious pattern repetition or overly sharp edges, maintaining a thematic consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ocean creature motifs on the armor of the leftmost figure small, integrated, and positioned in a way that does not distort the armor’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean creature motifs on the leftmost figure's armor in Image B are designed to be detailed and decorative additions without interrupting the overall form. These motifs appear to be well-integrated into the armor's design, maintaining proportional balance and avoiding any distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows of the figures fall forward onto the rocks in alignment with the sun’s position behind them, and are the silhouettes sharp and unbroken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the figures fall appropriately on the landscape, aligned with the backlit setting sun. These shadows logically move forward onto the rocks, and the silhouettes of the figures are sharp and complete, matching the light source arrangement.",
