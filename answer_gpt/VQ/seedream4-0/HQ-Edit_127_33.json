        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the topiary structures have been transformed into large, mystical figures with vine-like textures. These figures maintain smooth, continuous surfaces that appear organic and fitting with the surreal theme. The textures mimic natural vines and tree bark, demonstrating a fluid design without noticeable distortion or pixelation, which suggests an effective integration into the scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features vine-like paths that wind through the garden in a fluid manner. These vine paths are seamlessly integrated into the landscape, visually connecting the different elements of the garden.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, butterfly-like creatures appear at varying depths throughout the scene. They are scaled appropriately according to their distance from the viewer, maintaining a sense of perspective. The edges are soft, matching the ambient lighting, which helps them fit naturally within the garden setting.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral crowns in the edited image are placed atop the heads of the large, vine-textured topiary figures. The crowns are positioned with consideration of natural attachment points that seem logical given the flowing design of the figures. The petals appear well-aligned, with no indication of floating or misalignment, contributing to the overall harmonious design.",
