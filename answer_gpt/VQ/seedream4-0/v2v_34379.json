      "question": "Do the shrunk vegetables retain their natural texture and fine details without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the vegetables, particularly the cauliflower and broccoli, appears less fresh and detailed compared to what would be expected for raw vegetables. The vegetables on the left side appear somewhat spoiled or wilted, with a less appealing texture. The roasted broccoli on the right, while generally intact, displays significant browning, indicating visible alterations in texture due to the roasting process. These observations, combined with common knowledge about how fresh vegetables should appear, suggest that the texture is not optimally preserved.",

      "question": "Are the shapes of the shrunk vegetables proportionate and physically plausible, avoiding any unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli and cauliflower largely retain their natural shapes. The pieces of broccoli and cauliflower are recognizable and maintain a realistic form. The roasted broccoli on the right, despite being browned, does not display any noticeable distortion in shape that would make them physically implausible. Therefore, based on this observation and knowledge of typical vegetable shapes, they appear proportionate and naturally distorted.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shrinkage preserve the natural colors and material appearance of the vegetables without introducing any artificial tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the vegetables have diminished slightly. The fresh cauliflower and broccoli appear less vivid and more yellowish-brown, indicating some deviation from their natural colors, possibly due to overexposure to heat or age. The roasted broccoli on the right shows an intensified brown color, typical of roasting. These colors are consistent with common knowledge about roasting processes, yet the fresh vegetables do not display their freshest natural tones, suggesting a failure to maintain the natural color fully.",

      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement of the shrunk vegetables consistent with the original structure, maintaining visual credibility within the dish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spatial arrangement of vegetables in Image B appears logical and maintains the structure set in Image A. The cauliflower and broccoli are arranged in a manner that suggests they were initially distributed uniformly across their respective dishes. The arrangement does not show disruption or inconsistency within the context of baked dishes, maintaining a credible presentation per culinary standards.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the edges and geometric shapes of the shrunk vegetables remained intact, avoiding any broken or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of both the roasted and fresh vegetables remain largely intact. There is no evident fragmentation or unnatural appearance along the edges of the vegetables. The cauliflower and broccoli in both dishes retain their geometric integrity, following the natural contours expected of such items. Thus, they seem intact and without broken edges.",
