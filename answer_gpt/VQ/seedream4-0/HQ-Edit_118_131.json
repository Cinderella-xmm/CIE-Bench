      "question": "Are the added gears and copper accents seamlessly integrated into the silver surface of the teapot without visible texture inconsistencies or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added gears and copper accents on the teapot appear to be smoothly embedded within the intricate design of the silver surface. The textures of the silver and copper are visually consistent, with no abrupt or awkward transitions that break the illusion of a unified surface. This seamless integration suggests careful attention to the merging of different materials in creating a cohesive look, which is well reflected in the absence of visible texture inconsistencies or discontinuities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome appear transparent and smoothly contoured without geometric distortions or artificial edges that break the illusion of a real glass enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a curved glass dome that encapsulates the teapot and accessories. The glass is rendered with a clear, transparent appearance, showing smooth contours without any distortions. The absence of jagged or artificial edges enhances the illusion of real glass, as it faithfully follows the natural curvature expected from such enclosures. The dome appears well-constructed, maintaining a realistic appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden floorboards and scattered tea leaves rendered with realistic textures and proportions, and do the tiny silver utensils appear appropriately scaled and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden floorboards exhibit detailed grain and texture, mimicking realistic wood. Their proportions are consistent with what one would expect in a platform supporting objects. The scattered tea leaves on the boards are varied in size and appear naturally distributed. The silver utensils are finely detailed, appropriately scaled, and harmonize with the teacup's intricacy, reinforcing the scene's realism.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the moss accents naturally distributed along the base edge, with soft, organic texture and no signs of unnatural clustering or color mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss accents in Image B are dispersed along the base edge of the wooden platform. They display a soft, organic texture that mimics real moss, with harmonious coloration matching natural moss shades. Their placement avoids unnatural clustering, contributing to a believable image where the moss seamlessly accentuates the base without standing out inconsistently.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam effect emerging from the elephant's trunk appear as a smooth, translucent vapor with natural diffusion and no jagged edges or artificial glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows steam emerging from the elephant's trunk, characterized by smooth diffusion and a translucent quality. The vapor lacks jagged edges or exaggerated glow, appearing consistent with natural steam. Its gradual dispersion enhances the realism, resulting in a credible steam effect that gently integrates into the scene's ambiance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the vine-like metalwork elements consistently shaped and positioned around the dome, following natural curvatures without intersecting the glass unnaturally or creating inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine-like metalwork elements exhibit consistent shaping and positioning around the glass dome, following natural curvatures. They are arranged in a way that prevents unnatural intersections with the glass, maintaining the integrity of both materials. The shadows are consistent and do not display anomalies, contributing to an integrated and harmonious design.",
