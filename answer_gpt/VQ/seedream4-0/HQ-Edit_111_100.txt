    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire surface of the LEGO statue display uniform brick textures with no visible patches of residual wood grain or inconsistent material transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue appears to be constructed entirely out of LEGO bricks, as indicated by the distinct rectangular shapes typical of LEGO. The surface shows a consistent brick texture throughout the statue. There are no visual indicators of any residual wood grain textures or transitions to other materials. Given the precise and consistent brick pattern, it is reasonable to conclude that the surface is uniform.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed carvings on the headdress, chest plate, and belt represented by small, precisely placed LEGO bricks that preserve the original patterns without loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows that the headdress, chest plate, and belt are constructed with LEGO bricks. However, given the limited resolution of detail achievable with LEGO bricks compared to the finer carving detail typically seen in non-LEGO statues, there is a loss of intricacy in these areas. Thus, the patterns are not preserved in their original detailed form.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms, legs, and torso of the LEGO statue maintain natural human proportions with correctly scaled joints and limbs?",
    "explanation": "The statue in Image B is stylized due to being made from LEGO bricks, which inherently limits anatomical accuracy and natural proportions. LEGO models often don't replicate human anatomy precisely, and in this case, the limbs and joints are blocky rather than naturally scaled, reflecting the limitations of LEGO in representing realistic human forms.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both hands of the LEGO statue have five distinct fingers with natural finger positioning and no signs of merging or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the statue appear to be constructed from larger LEGO bricks, which restricts the ability to create detailed and distinct fingers. Typically, LEGO figures or models do not feature realistic hands with all five fingers separate, especially in larger models. The fingers are likely merged or stylized without natural positioning, typical of LEGO constructs.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue centered on a flat white pedestal with realistic shadows and reflections that align with the lighting direction in the gallery?",
    "explanation": "The statue in Image B is indeed centered on a flat white pedestal. The lighting in the gallery casts shadows and creates reflections consistent with the lighting setup, which strikes from above, appearing realistic and maintaining consistency with the environment shown. Thus, the scene presents a coherent and believable setting with proper shading and alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
