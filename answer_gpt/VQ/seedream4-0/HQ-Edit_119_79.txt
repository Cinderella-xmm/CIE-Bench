    "Question": "Q1: Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's shape is transformed into a contiguous mass of crystals. The structure still maintains the original pose and proportions of the cat depicted in Image A, with its body, legs, and sitting posture clearly recognizable. There are no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form, as the crystal construction emulates the general silhouette and alignment of the feline body. This preservation of form demonstrates a successful translation from a fur-covered cat to a crystal version without distorting its anatomical integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
    "explanation": "The emerald crystal eyes in Image B are placed symmetrically within the face, mirroring the position of the cat’s eyes in Image A. They match the size and shape from the original image, with a reflective quality that aligns with their intended gem-like nature. The positioning and proportions are consistent with the original facial structure, suggesting a faithful adaptation in the transformation process.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's crystal front paws rest firmly on the wooden block, consistent with how the original cat's paws are placed in Image A. The hind legs also support the body logically without any indication of floating or disconnect. The transformation to crystal doesn't interfere with the physical placement or the logic of weight distribution, thus maintaining continuity with the original pose.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
    "explanation": "The surfaces of the quartz and obsidian crystals in Image B exhibit realistic textures that showcase variations in translucency and reflectiveness. These qualities mimic natural gemstones, with detailed shading and edge definitions that align with different crystals. No pixelation or unnatural smoothness is noted, corroborating a polished and authentic gemstone appearance. The transformation focuses on detail, which enhances the realism of the crystal depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden block retains its original texture, color, and lighting as seen in Image A. The consistency in these elements suggests that no alteration was made to the block itself. Furthermore, the shadows cast by the crystal cat are logically aligned with its position, illustrating proper interaction with the light sources without creating gaps or distortions below or around the block. This maintains the scene's overall cohesive appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
