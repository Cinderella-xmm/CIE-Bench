    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut is depicted in a stylized, illustrative form. Despite the simplification typical of illustrations, the helmet and suit segments are smooth and maintain geometric consistency with recognizable forms, such as rounded edges and connected segments. There are no jagged or broken edges apparent, which are typical artifacts of poor edits. This indicates a deliberate choice to maintain consistency while simplifying details for clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a clean illustration style instead of detailed textures, so there is no texture in the traditional sense. However, the simplicity of the design does not exhibit any unnatural repetition or artificial patterns. The suit’s color and smooth design appear intentionally simplified, focusing on clarity and stylistic coherence rather than physical texture simulation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gold accents are present primarily around specific elements such as connectors and sections of the ISS. They appear confined to these areas without bleeding into other parts, maintaining distinct separation from adjacent colors. The artist's use of gold accents serves a decorative purpose and is isolated effectively without interference or color bleed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronaut’s limbs or the station structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, an arrow is shown pointing toward the ISS, indicating intended movement. The arrow is clearly placed and directed, without overlapping the astronaut's limbs or distorting the structure of the ISS. It serves its functional purpose of indicating direction while maintaining clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Step 1: Prepare -> Step 2: Navigate -> Step 3: Operate' is positioned along the bottom edge of Image B. It does not cover critical visual elements such as the Moon or ISS, preserving the focus on the main illustration. The text is clear and readable, without any distortion or shadow effects, supporting the didactic nature of the image.",
