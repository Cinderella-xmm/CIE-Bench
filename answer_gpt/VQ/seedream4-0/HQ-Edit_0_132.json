      "question": "Do the three figures retain anatomically correct body proportions and natural hand shapes (with no more than five fingers per hand) after being stylized as ink-painting poets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are stylized in the ink-painting manner typical of traditional Chinese art. Despite the stylization, their body proportions appear balanced and natural, adhering to the traditional aesthetics of such paintings. The hand shapes are depicted with accurate anatomy and do not exhibit more than five fingers per hand. This observation is consistent with common artistic practices in ink paintings where the human form maintains recognizable anatomical correctness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the willow branches and lotus leaves rendered with smooth, flowing brushstrokes that preserve their natural form and do not exhibit jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The willow branches and lotus leaves in Image B are rendered in a traditional ink-painting style, characterized by fluid and continuous brushstrokes that mimic the flow and grace of nature. The brushstrokes are smooth, capturing the natural forms without jagged edges or texture artifacts. This style stays true to the aesthetics of ink paintings, where smooth transitions and flowing forms are emphasized.",

      "question": "Does the mountain background feature soft, layered ink-wash gradients that blend naturally with the surrounding mist and sky without sharp transitions or artificial blur effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain background utilizes the ink-wash technique common in traditional Chinese landscape paintings. The gradients are soft and layered, allowing the mountains to blend seamlessly into the mist and sky. This method avoids sharp transitions and maintains a natural gradient typical of ink wash paintings, thus creating a harmonious integration into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the arm and hand positions of the figures show natural joint alignment and fluid motion, with no bent or missing fingers or unnatural limb extensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arm and hand positions of the figures in Image B exhibit natural joint alignment and fluid motion, which is indicative of the serene and harmonious gestures commonly associated with Tai Chi or similar postures. There are no bent, missing fingers, or unnatural limb extensions visible, suggesting attention to anatomical details even within the stylized context of ink paintings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ink-style elements (figures, willows, lotuses, mountains) harmoniously integrated into the scene with consistent lighting, shadow, and depth cues, and do they avoid appearing detached or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ink-style elements such as figures, willows, lotuses, and mountains are well-integrated within the scene. The consistent use of lighting, shadows, and depth cues contribute to the cohesive and unified appearance of the painting. Each component appears naturally positioned within the landscape, adhering to the aesthetic standards of ink paintings where elements blend to create a unified composition without seeming detached or out of place.",
