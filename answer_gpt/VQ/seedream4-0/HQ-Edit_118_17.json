      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the stave church have clear, smooth surfaces with realistic reflections and no visible distortion or warping of the church beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case surrounding the stave church is visually smooth and clear. The surface lacks significant distortion or warping based on the visible reflections, suggesting a realistic representation of glass. World knowledge about glass observations contributes to the analysis, as clear glass typically shows minimal distortion of what is within it.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the layered clouds in the background panel translucent and softly blended, showing depth without blocking or distorting the mountain range behind them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds appear to be somewhat opaque and feature a distinct visual style that does not suggest translucence. They seem to be part of an artistic representation on the background panel, which means they may slightly obscure the view of the mountains behind them due to their opacity and style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the small coniferous trees near the base of the church properly scaled, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the larger trees in the surrounding forest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the small coniferous trees are visually consistent in style with their larger counterparts surrounding the scene. However, they appear smaller in scale in relation to the larger trees nearby. The spacing is limited due to the effect of the glass case boundary, suggesting they are not evenly spaced as typical forest spacing would dictate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountains and sky in the background use a consistent muted palette that complements the dark wood tones of the church without creating jarring color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains and sky exhibit a muted palette that employs earthy tones, subtly blending with the dark wood tones of the church. This results in a harmonious visual transition without any color contrasts that would disrupt the aesthetic flow. World knowledge about compatibility between earthy tones aids in the judgment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the footprints on the snowy path subtle, evenly spaced, and aligned toward the entrance of the church, without appearing artificial or overly pronounced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the footprints on the snowy path exhibit light impressions consistent with realistic travel. They appear subtle, evenly spaced, leading directly to the church entrance. They do not exhibit features that would make them appear artificial or overly pronounced, indicative of realistic traversal. World knowledge of how footprints typically appear in snow reinforces the judgment.",
