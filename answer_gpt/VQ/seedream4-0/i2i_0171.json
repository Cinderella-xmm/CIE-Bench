      "question": "Do the skis appear naturally detached from the skier with no visible artifacts or unnatural distortions in their shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis attached to the figurine are positioned in a way that complements the skier's posture, suggesting movement as if the figurine is in a skiing position. The skis maintain a natural curve and alignment relative to the skier's legs, which is consistent with how skis are typically designed. There are no visible artifacts or distortions affecting the integrity and natural shape of the skis. In Image A, the skis are similarly well-positioned, maintaining anatomical correctness to real-life skiing equipment. Thus, comparing both images, Image B preserves the natural appearance and function of the skis.",

      "question": "Does the magnetic snow powder base integrate seamlessly into the snowy landscape without introducing unnatural textures or breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is placed on a round base covered with snow-like material. This base visually mimics the snowy landscape but is distinctly separate by its defined edge, which truly is a design typical for small figurines. The snow powder on the base does not disrupt the surrounding snowy background but rather complements it as a miniature representation of the bigger scene. It achieves a natural integration within the context of being a display piece. Therefore, the base does not break the structural consistency of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the skier's facial features and body proportions accurately preserved in the figurine form, avoiding any distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Excluding the blurred face, the figurine in Image B represents the skier with body proportions that appear consistent and proportionate to typical human anatomy. The limbs, posture, and overall stance of the figurine resemble natural human proportions, maintaining the essence and position seen in Image A. The facial features are not detailed, which hints at a stylized representation typical in figurines, but the body proportions do not show any distortions.",

      "question": "Do the packaging illustrations match the visual style and natural appearance of the skier and mountain environment without introducing any unnatural elements or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B features an illustration of the skier that is consistent with the visual presentation of the actual figurine and the snowy mountain theme. The colors, style, and depiction of the skier align with the photograph of the mountainous environment, creating a cohesive visual experience. The illustration does not introduce any unnatural elements or artifacts that would disrupt the harmonious representation of the skiing theme.",

      "question": "Are the skier's hands, ski poles, and posture anatomically correct and visually credible compared to the original image, with no unnatural shapes or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's hands and ski poles are positioned to mimic a skiing action, reflecting a realistic and dynamic posture. The hands grip the poles appropriately, and the overall stance matches the skier's functional movement in skiing. When compared to Image A, which shows a live-action depiction of skiing, the figurine maintains credible anatomical correctness and offers a visually believable interpretation of skiing posture. There are no unnatural shapes or distortions in the figurine's representation.",
