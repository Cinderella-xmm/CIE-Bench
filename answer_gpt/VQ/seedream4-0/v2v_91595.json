      "question": "Does the mechanical eye seamlessly integrate with the camera's original form without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera has been modified by integrating a mechanical owl that includes glowing mechanical eyes where the camera lens would be. The eyes are crafted in a precise manner with gears and intricate designs that fit into the lens slot of the camera. The integration is done skillfully, preserving the detailed texture and fine details akin to high-quality mechanical elements. They do not appear unnatural or out of place in the context of the camera's existing design. Therefore, the eyes enhance the design rather than detract from it.",

      "question": "Do the copper feathers appear naturally integrated with the camera's casing, maintaining the overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, copper feathers are added around the mechanical owl on top of the camera. These feathers are made of a shiny, metal-like material and are artistically positioned to blend with the mechanical aesthetic of the owl and camera. They are integrated into the camera casing at the edges and do not cause visual tension or appear as if they have been awkwardly added. Instead, they enhance the steampunk aesthetic while maintaining the camera's authenticity and expansiveness.",

      "question": "Are the gears and springs within the battery compartment depicted in a way that preserves the structural consistency and visual credibility of the camera?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals gears and springs inside the battery compartment, replacing the standard electronic components seen in Image A. Despite these additions, the interior maintains a consistent structural appearance, similar to a well-crafted steampunk device. The positioning, size, and intricate detailing of these components uphold the visual integrity and credibility of an alternative mechanical camera structure.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the camera and the clockwork owl elements create a visually credible and coherent scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clockwork owl atop the camera that naturally blends with its body. The owl's design, with mechanical eyes and copper feathers, aligns with the steampunk theme and complements the camera body with gears in the battery compartment. These additions are harmonious with a coherent theme, maintaining the device's structure and presenting a believable mechanical marvel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the added elements, such as the mechanical eye and copper feathers, avoid distortion and maintain a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added mechanical elements such as the eyes and feathers maintain proper proportions that align well with the original dimensions of the camera. The owl's features have been scaled to match the camera's size without appearing oversized or distorted, ensuring a natural aesthetic without compromising physical rationality or visual flow.",
