      "question": "Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marbled ceramic finish on the vases is visible. The pattern looks smooth and natural, simulating the randomness typically seen in marbling, without any evident breaks or repeated textures. This conclusion is drawn from the observation of the swirling marbling patterns that appear naturally varied across the surfaces, resembling authentic marble material.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On examining Image B, the branding decals are placed on the vase's top, visible and harmonious with the curvature. They seem proportionally sized and aligned, which is critical for maintaining brand visibility and attractiveness on rounded surfaces. The decals do not seem distorted, helping maintain a polished appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold leaf accents on the vases in Image B show variations in color and shine typical of metallic foil, with visible highlights that indicate a light source and definition along the edges. This suggests a realistic representation consistent with how actual metallic foil appears when applied to curved surfaces, capturing light and creating a dynamic look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide a visible cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box that directly reveals the internal petal arrangement of the vases, so this aspect cannot be accurately assessed or compared. Without such a reference, it's not feasible to determine if there's a geometric mismatch or layering accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography on the packaging box in Image B is clear and legible. The spacing between letters appears consistent, and there are no visible blurring effects or unwanted shadows that would obscure or affect the readability. This neat presentation ensures the branding is easily recognizable and aesthetically pleasing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, the vases are symmetrical and proportionate, featuring an organic petal design. Comparing this with Image B, the vases also maintain a consistent shape and size, with no visible signs of stretching or compression. They uphold their overall symmetry, reflecting faithful adherence to the original design dimensions and form.",
