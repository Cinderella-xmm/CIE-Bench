    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the fabric folds of the woman's dress clearly defined and consistent with natural draping behavior, without unnatural smoothing or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric folds of the woman's dress are intricately modeled and clearly defined, resembling the natural behavior of flowing fabric. The texture and ambient shading contribute to a realistic look, avoiding any unnatural smoothing or pixelation effects. This can be visually assessed by observing the detailed creases and the way light interacts with the fabric, corresponding with expectations based on real-world fabric draping.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral and curvilinear motifs in the background remain continuous and symmetrical, with no visible breaks or misalignments in the decorative framework?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and curvilinear motifs present a continuous design without breaks or misalignments. Such decorative frameworks typically emphasize symmetry and harmony, which is visually represented here by the consistent flow of the motifs and their seamless integration into the overall design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold trim along the perimeter of the image evenly applied, with consistent thickness and reflective properties that match the surrounding lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold trim in Image B appears evenly applied, maintaining consistent thickness throughout its circumference. This is expected in designs featuring perimeter trims as it contributes to a balanced aesthetic. The reflective properties of the trim are coherent with the image's lighting conditions, showing signs of well-managed illumination effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the womanâ€™s right hand maintain a natural position with five fingers properly aligned and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's right hand is positioned naturally with five fingers properly aligned, similar to real anatomical positioning. This reflects the usual expectations for hand rendering where alignment and proportionality are key for realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors throughout the image uniformly balanced, with no sudden transitions or patches of unnatural saturation that suggest layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are uniformly balanced, with smooth transitions and harmonious integration across different sections of the image. There is no abrupt change in saturation values, suggesting no layering errors like unsightly patches or unnatural color transitions, which contributes to an overall cohesive aesthetic.",
