      "question": "Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the tiger's face are noted for their precision and clarity. The lines exhibit uniform thickness, which lends the design a polished, clean appearance. Additionally, there is an absence of pixelation or broken lines which could suggest poor rendering. This suggests a deliberate, high-quality digital editing process, contrasting with Image A where textures appear fur-like and more intricate.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the stripes and whiskers are designed with strong geometric symmetry, enhancing the stylized nature of the mask without distorting the tiger's face. These elements remain proportionately consistent, reinforcing the harmonious balance typical of deliberate artistic design. By contrast, Image A's naturalistic textures allow slight asymmetric variances typical of more realistic depictions.",

      "question": "Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono panels are distinctly structured into layers with defined, clean edges. This separation contributes to an organized appearance, indicative of thoughtful design. The lack of overlapping or floating elements points to careful digital manipulation ensuring coherent presentation. Image A displays a more natural flow of fabric, emphasizing texture over layered structure.",

      "question": "Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases gold foil elements that consistently reflect light. They effectively blend with the floral design, providing a harmonious integration without any jarring highlights or disruptive fragments, indicating skilled digital contrasting. In Image A, the floral patterns do not incorporate gold elements, focusing instead on fabric texture and coloration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the panels are meticulously aligned with the structural seams and edges of the attire, implying secure attachment and coherence. The digital edit ensures these panels do not err in positioning, thus appearing as part of a seamless garment design. In Image A, the garment is portrayed as a traditional kimono without noticeable detachable panels.",
