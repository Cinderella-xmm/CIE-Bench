      "question": "Is the text 'flyaway' added below the painting seamlessly integrated into the image without disrupting its authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'flyaway' is located below the painting in the center of the image. The font style and color appear to be chosen to complement the existing decor and lighting, giving it an integrated look. The text does not seem out of place or artificially imposed upon the surface, suggesting that it aligns well with the overall aesthetic. Thus, it does not disrupt the authentic appearance of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the handwriting of 'flyaway' appear natural and consistent with what one would expect on a postcard-style image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'flyaway' appears in a cursive, handwritten style that is often associated with personal, artistic touches seen on postcards or art prints. This font style complements the visual aesthetic of the image, which features a serene landscape painting. Such script fonts are typical in environments aiming for an artistic or personalized look, thus appearing natural in this context.",

      "question": "Has the addition of 'flyaway' caused any visible artifacts or unnatural textures around the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon closely observing Image B, the text 'flyaway' is neatly blended into the wall space beneath the painting, consistent with the surface texture and lighting of the surrounding area. There are no visible inconsistencies, pixelation, or disruption of textures that indicate the addition of the text has been poorly edited. Therefore, there are no artifacts or unnatural textures present.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the text 'flyaway' maintain proper proportion and not cover any significant part of the painting or adjacent objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'flyaway' is positioned below the painting and above the wooden cabinet. It is sized appropriately, maintaining proportion with the other elements in the scene without overshadowing the painting or interfering with the adjacent decor. This placement ensures the text complements rather than detracts from the overall visual composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image still visually coherent and balanced after adding the text 'flyaway'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of 'flyaway' in Image B is placed centrally below the painting and above the cabinet, ensuring that it aligns with the existing design elements. The aesthetic flow from the potted plants and painting remains undisturbed, allowing the room's decor to remain harmonious and visually balanced. This text addition enhances the image while keeping consistency with its style and atmosphere.",
