      "question": "Do the enhanced flowers exhibit vivid but natural color gradients and soft, detailed textures without visible artifacts like oversharpening or color smearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers are depicted with a range of colors that transition smoothly and with clarity, suggesting a natural color gradient. The textures appear soft and detailed, indicating no excessive sharpening or color smearing, which would otherwise distort the natural appearance of the flowers. Comparing this with general expectations for high-quality images, these visual properties align with the characteristics of vivid but natural floral representation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel and watering can exhibit surface characteristics typical of metal, such as subtle tarnish and natural-looking reflections. These textures contribute to the authenticity of antique metal objects, avoiding unnatural glossiness or distortion that might suggest modern or digital artifacts. This observation aligns with world knowledge of how antique metal objects appear visually.",
