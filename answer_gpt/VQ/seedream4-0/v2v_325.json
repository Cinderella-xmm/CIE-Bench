      "question": "Do the chibi car mascots retain their original car shapes and colors without any noticeable distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi car mascots are designed to appear cartoonish, which inherently alters their original shapes to give them a rounded, playful appearance with expressive faces. While they retain their vivid colors similar to the original cars in Image A, the modification to a chibi style introduces distortion from their realistic forms. Therefore, although the colors are preserved, the shapes are intentionally altered for a stylized effect.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into chibi mascots incorporates an illustrative style rather than realistic texturing present in Image A. The cars display simplified textures, characteristic of playful mascots, which deviates from the original car's detailed textures and features. This stylistic choice is natural in the context of chibi design but introduces unnatural artifacts compared to realistic detailing.",
