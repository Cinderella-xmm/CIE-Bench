      "question": "Do the textures of the bronze sculpture accurately represent the casual clothing and relaxed poses of the individuals without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze sculpture captures the essence of casual clothing and relaxed poses through the texture and shaping of the figures. The texture mimics the folds and fall of fabric, as well as the natural posture of the individuals. Since no unnatural artifacts are present and the poses seem naturally replicated in a bronze medium, we assess that the textures are accurately represented.",

      "question": "Does the bronze sculpture of the white SUV maintain its original structure and proportions without any visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpted SUV appears to maintain the original vehicle's structure and proportions. The shape of the hood, the wheels, and other visible parts align well with the characteristics expected from a typical SUV. Without any evident warping or disproportion, the sculpture preserves the vehicle's integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the gentle waves and sandy beach depicted in the bronze diorama with natural undulations and without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the waves and sandy beach have been transformed into a bronze diorama. The natural flowing lines and the smoothness of the beach scene transition into the bronze form without evident unnatural textures. The area maintains the essence of natural undulation that one would expect from an ocean meeting a beach.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands and facial expressions of the individuals in the bronze diorama retain natural shapes and details without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and hands appear crafted with due attention to detail, capturing the natural curves and gestures of human anatomy appropriately in bronze. Since bronze sculpture naturally lacks facial expressions due to material constraints, this part cannot be assessed. However, the hands seem to retain their expected shapes without obvious distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition of the bronze diorama, including the placement of the individuals and the vehicle, match the original scene without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a well-composed diorama where the placement of the individuals and vehicle is consistent with Image A. The positions match, with no evident inconsistencies or shifts in their relative arrangement. This careful placement ensures the diorama remains true to the original scene.",
