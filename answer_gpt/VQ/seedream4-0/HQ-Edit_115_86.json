      "question": "Does the tutu maintain a balanced, layered structure with no visible warping or collapsed sections that suggest digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tutu in Image B visually maintains a well-balanced structure, with a clear depiction of layers that show a consistent and smooth appearance. The gradients in the tutu and the detailing with sparkles are distributed evenly, showing no signs of digital distortion. The logical analysis involves recognizing the uniformity in shape and distribution of elements in the tutu as depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glitter elements seamlessly blended into the tutu and bodice, showing natural variation in size and brightness without pixelation or unnatural clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glitter elements appear to be an integral part of the tutu and bodice, with variations in size and brightness that seem natural for an illustration. The seamless blending is achieved by the consistent art style that gives an even distribution and integration without any visible pixelation or clumping. Logical reasoning involves understanding that a consistent art style would not typically show pixelation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background gradient smooth and continuous, with no visible banding or abrupt color shifts that separate it from the subjectâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a smooth gradient with no visible banding or abrupt shifts in color between the ballerina and the background. This smooth transition implies careful design where the silhouette is clearly highlighted against a continuous backdrop, typical of high-quality illustrations. The reasoning is based on observing the perfectly graduated color blending.",

      "question": "Are the blank message areas fully opaque and aligned with the image plane, with no visible edge artifacts or texture disruption beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blank message areas in Image B are designed to appear fully opaque and perfectly aligned with the horizontal and vertical image planes. There are no visible edge artifacts or disruptions in texture beneath them, which is evidenced by the clean and uniform surface continuity across the image, indicating well-rendered regions appropriate for placeholder texts. This conclusion is drawn by evaluating the clarity and sharpness of these sections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the floral motifs along the borders stay within the frame boundaries and maintain consistent scale and orientation without intersecting the ballerina or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral motifs are positioned along the border as decorative illustrations. They maintain a consistent scale and orientation, fitting within the overall design and they do not intersect the ballerina or the floor. This suggests a balanced composition with carefully confined decorative elements. The reasoning involves checking the spatial relationships and overlaps present in the image.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands show exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or fused digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the ballerina in Image B depict exactly five fingers each, with a natural spacing and curvature that is typical of human anatomy. The hands are shown in a graceful pose consistent with ballet positions and do not show additional or fused digits. This conclusion is made by analyzing the anatomy as portrayed in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are both feet positioned correctly on pointe with natural arches and toes, and is the supporting leg aligned to sustain the posture without unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both feet are illustrated on pointe with the correct shape and structure typical of ballet dance. The arches and toes appear naturally defined, and the supporting leg shows proper alignment to sustain the depicted ballet posture. The reasoning is based on comparing the pose to standard ballet positions and verifying anatomical accuracy.",
