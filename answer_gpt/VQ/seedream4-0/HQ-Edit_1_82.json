      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast is depicted with natural and anatomically correct limb postures.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sequins appear aligned with the design of the leotard, adding visual interest without disrupting or clashing with the overall outfit. The sequins remain uniformly distributed across the leotard, avoiding clusters or overlaps that would look unnatural or inconsistent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The triptych artwork in Image B is designed such that each panel fully contains the depicted gymnast and the balance beam, ensuring key elements like the gymnast's head and beam are not split or awkwardly truncated by panel borders. This careful boundary positioning maintains the integrity of the visuals.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dark walnut frame in Image B is depicted with even texture and depth, surrounding the artwork consistently. It fits flush to the surface, without casting odd shadows or exhibiting translucency, which ensures it complements the artwork rather than distracting from it.",
