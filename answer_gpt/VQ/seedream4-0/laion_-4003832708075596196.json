      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed trunk sections into arms and legs follow natural joint-like curves and avoid sharp, unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree's trunk is altered to resemble arms and legs for the characters. These limbs flow seamlessly, appearing rounded and curved similar to natural joints in real limb structures. The absence of any sharp angles or unnatural bends contributes to a cohesive and smooth transformation from tree structure to human-like limbs, with cartoonish fluidity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaf-shaped heads composed of intact maple leaves with visible veins and gradient coloring, and do the facial features (eyes, mouth) sit naturally on the surface without distorting the leaf shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Maple leaves in Image B creatively serve as heads with basic facial features like eyes and mouths that are integrated naturally into the leaf's surface. The leaves maintain their integrity, displaying consistent outline shapes suggestive of maple leaves. However, veins and gradient coloring typical in natural leaves are absent, simplifying the design to match the cartoon style. Yet, the facial elements don't distort the leaf shape or anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the hats and scarves rendered with the same flat, vector-style design as the rest of the image, and do they have consistent edge lines and no visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hats and scarves are illustrated adopting a flat, consistent vector art style that matches the other components of the image. The edge lines are smooth and consistent, adhering to the overall artistic theme, lacking any texture discrepancies or artifacts. This design coherence ensures the elements are visually integrated within the design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all added elements (limbs, faces, accessories) colored exclusively within the original orange, yellow, red, and brown spectrum, with no unexpected or contrasting hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes a controlled color palette, mainly consisting of autumnal shades: orange, yellow, red, and brown. All elements, including limbs, facial features, and accessories adhere to this color scheme, contributing to a harmonious visual that aligns with the seasonal theme without introducing contrasting hues.",

      "question": "Do all anthropomorphized tree characters and their accessories lie completely within the brown rectangular border without extending outside its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, all tree-based characters, including their accessories such as hats and scarves, are contained entirely within the confines of the brown rectangular border. This alignment ensures the main subjects do not break out of the intended composition framework, keeping the design orderly and neat.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles placed near the characters without overlapping leaves or limbs, and do they have consistent line thickness and transparent fill matching the illustrationâ€™s style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Text bubbles in Image B are strategically placed close to the anthropomorphized tree characters, avoiding overlaps with leaves or limbs. Their design maintains a consistent line thickness, relatable to the illustration style, featuring a transparent fill that prevents obstructing visual elements, thus maintaining stylistic consistency.",
