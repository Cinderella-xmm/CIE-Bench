    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the headdress displays a detailed brass and copper texture that appears smooth and reflective, maintaining a consistent appearance throughout the visible parts. The transitions between the mechanical and traditional elements seem seamless, with no noticeable noise or patchiness. This suggests a high level of attention to detail in maintaining uniformity across the textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical and horizontal stripes in the nemes headdress appear aligned and evenly spaced. Despite the addition of mechanical components, such as gears and pipes, the original pattern of the headdress remains intact without any noticeable bending or misalignment. This indicates careful integration of additional elements to preserve the headdress's original structure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical wings in Image B are symmetrically positioned on both sides of the head, with carefully defined edges and joints. The emerald accents are integrated into the structure, providing a cohesive design. The careful placement and connection of these elements suggest a thoughtful design ensuring that they appear attached and integral to the overall composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clockwork designs in Image B are detailed and clearly delineated over the collar, with elements such as gears and pipes positioned thoughtfully. The steam exhaust pipes are attached at plausible angles, appearing functionally integrated without overlapping or clipping into other visual components. This indicates that careful consideration was given to maintaining clarity and spacing among the elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vapor emanating from the steam exhaust pipes is depicted as translucent with a soft diffusion that mimics realistic steam. There are no sharp edges, pixelation, or artifacting observed, which implies a high-quality rendering of these effects, maintaining an illusion of natural dispersal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis specifically excludes the blurred portion (face), so we cannot assess the alignment or anatomical correctness of the features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Details concerning these features are entirely obscured, preventing evaluation.",
