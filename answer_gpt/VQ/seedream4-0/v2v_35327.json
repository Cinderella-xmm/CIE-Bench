      "question": "Does the gold banana appear naturally integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the gold banana has been edited to transform into a golden polyhedron, losing its original banana shape. The integration appears seamless with the blue figure holding it, without visible artifacts or unnatural textures, suggesting careful editing to ensure consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the liquefying textures applied to the blue figure natural, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the blue figure has undergone an artistic transformation with liquefying textures. The edit gives the figure a realistic gloss and flow characteristic of fluids, with detailed contours and sheen maintained, which achieves a natural and complete surreal effect according to the surreal style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the fantastical background maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, without any broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surrealistic background features swirling colors and shapes that are consistently executed without broken geometric shapes or unexpected textures. The fantastical elements are cohesively integrated, maintaining a credible surreal aesthetic.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of elements in the surrealist-style painting maintain visual credibility and avoid any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The second image is deliberately designed with surreal elements, including a dripping effect and floating shapes. The composition cleverly balances the unusual elements while maintaining visual credibility and avoiding distortions, which is vital for surrealist artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the banana retain its natural appearance, with the correct number of fingers, natural lines, and textures conforming to ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the hand has shifted from holding a banana to holding polyhedron shapes. Despite the shift, the hand maintains the correct number of fingers and an ergonomic grip, though altered in color and context to fit the surreal scene. Given the hand's anatomical consistency, it retains a natural appearance.",
