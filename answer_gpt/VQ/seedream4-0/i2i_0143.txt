    "Question": "Q3: Do the shadows and lighting effects on the parking meter match what would be expected in a desert setting under bright sunlight?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the parking meter shows a high contrast, typical of bright sunlight. The sun flare at the top of the meter matches the intensity one would expect in a desert environment. The shadows are directed and soft, resembling the effects of sunlight in an open and sunny setting. This suggests the lighting application is consistent with a desert scenario.",

    "Question": "Q5: Does the parking meter appear naturally placed in the desert highway setting without looking misplaced or awkward?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the unusual concept of a parking meter being situated on a desert highway, the image integration itself is natural. Visually, the meter's robust positioning and consistent lighting contribute to a cohesive scene, without any awkwardness or signs of poor editing.",
