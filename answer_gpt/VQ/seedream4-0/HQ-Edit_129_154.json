    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown on the owl's head maintains well-defined edges and consistent geometry, similar to other metallic elements in the image. There is a homogeneity in the metallic surface, reflecting light uniformly like the teapot's lid in Image A. The consistent and smooth appearance suggests no distortions or broken geometry in the transformation from the teapot lid.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation from teapot spout to owl beak is visually smooth and continuous. The beak's surface appears consistent with the incident light reflections characteristic of metal, and there are no visible cracks or unnatural textures. Comparing this to the original teapot spout in Image A reveals the preservation of surface continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handle transforms into an owl's tail, maintaining a smooth curve consistent with the body. The tail's formation aligns well proportionally, reflecting a coherent integration with the owl's metallic texture without abrupt angles. The handle's original curve in Image A helps achieve this smooth transformation with consistent alignment.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical eyes in Image B are symmetrically placed on the owl's head, reinforcing balance in its design. The eyes exhibit a soft glow without causing halos or color bleeding, and the visible cogs integrate seamlessly with the owl's metallic feathers. The metallic surface's texture is consistent across the owl, mirroring the original metal consistency found in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden branch displays rich wood texture with visible grain patterns, maintaining natural shadows and depth that harmonize with the metal owl sculpture. This depth and texture consistency is distinct from the flat surface of the wooden table in Image A, highlighting effective integration into the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features detailed engravings mimicking metallic feathers, showing consistent layering and directionality. There is no pixelation or loss of detail, effectively transforming the intricate teapot engravings from Image A into coherent feather patterns. The detailing matches the metallic surface's overall harmony.",
