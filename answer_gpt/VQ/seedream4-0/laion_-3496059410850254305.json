      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar's shape has been preserved with minimal distortion as it is integrated into the armored figure. The body of the guitar maintains its overall outline, suggesting that the original shape remains largely intact in the edited image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the wood grain pattern of the guitar, while integrating metallic elements around the figure. There is no clear indication of artificial tiling or unnatural reflections disrupting the wood grain on the guitar body, which suggests consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines representing the guitar and its texture seem to be consistently aligned and follow the guitar’s curvature. There are no visible interruptions or misalignments with the structural elements depicted.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the strings are visually intact and continuous, maintaining a taut appearance as they align with the contour of the guitar and the figure. They do not exhibit kinks or floating segments, indicating a seamless integration.",
