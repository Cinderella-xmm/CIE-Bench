      "question": "Is the surface of the unicornâ€™s body uniformly smooth and reflective, resembling a glazed ceramic finish without patches of residual fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's body appears smooth and reflective, which is characteristic of a glazed ceramic finish. The surface lacks any visible fur texture, achieving a uniform smoothness typical of porcelain or ceramic sculptures. This is consistent with the appearance of a manufactured object rather than a living, textured creature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mane and tail composed of thin, curved porcelain-like structures that follow the natural flow of the original hair and are securely attached to the head and base of the tail without floating or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane and tail consist of structured, flowing, and curled shapes that exhibit a porcelain-like appearance. These elements adhere seamlessly to their respective places on the unicorn, emulating the natural flow seen in the original, but in a solidified, sculptural form. There are no signs of disconnection or inconsistency in their attachment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the horn form a continuous, symmetrical spiral shape made of reflective metallic material, originating from the same position as the original horn and maintaining proportional size relative to the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horn in Image B is depicted with a continuous and symmetrical spiral made from a reflective metallic material. This spiraled design is typical in ornamental and styled objects, appropriate for a unicorn figure. It emerges from the same position as in Image A, maintaining relative proportions in accordance with the size of the unicorn's head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned on a flat, subtly textured stone base that contrasts with the original forest floor, with no visible remnants of trees, dirt, or foliage in the immediate surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn stands on a distinctly flat and subtly textured stone base. This contrasts sharply with the outdoor forest floor of Image A, where no similar natural elements like trees, dirt, or foliage are visible. The presence of an indoor setting eliminates outdoor elements, reinforcing the sculpture's placement on a simple, artificial base.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the sculpture soft and directional, casting subtle highlights on the glazed surface and porcelain curls, consistent with indoor gallery illumination rather than outdoor moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is soft and directional, casting subtle highlights across the unicorn's glossy surface and structured porcelain curls. This type of lighting is consistent with indoor gallery environments. Unlike the moonlit atmosphere in Image A, this setting provides controlled illumination that emphasizes the artistic and display aspects of the sculpture.",
