      "question": "Do the textures and materials of the baseball and glove appear natural and consistent in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, three separate views are presented: a top view, a side view, and a sectional view of a baseball glove with a baseball. The texture of the baseball in each view shows a realistic leather surface with visible seams and stitching, which is consistent with real-life appearance. The glove's leather texture is also consistent across views, showing the typical patterns and colorations of a baseball glove. The coherence in material appearance throughout these images suggests a realistic portrayal. Therefore, the textures and materials are depicted in a natural and consistent manner.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the baseball and glove accurate and maintain their expected size relationships in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the baseball appears to be the appropriate size in relation to the glove in each of the three images. The glove holds the baseball comfortably, as expected, considering its dimensions. In each view, the baseball fits within the palm section of the glove, consistent with how these items are used in reality (the glove should be able to securely hold a regulation-sized baseball). Thus, the proportions are accurately maintained, reflecting the expected size relationship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, around the baseball or glove in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outlines of the baseball and glove are smooth and well-defined in all views. There are no visible jagged edges or inconsistencies around the perimeters, and the transitions between the objects and their backgrounds appear smooth. This indicates that there are no obvious artifacts or signs of unnatural blending present. Thus, the edges and blending are handled well, with no apparent visual artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove look natural and consistent with the lighting conditions in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on both the baseball and the glove is consistent across the views. The shadows and highlights are placed in a logical manner according to a single light source, emphasizing the natural curvature and depth of the objects. The glove's leather and the baseball's spherical surface reflect light in a manner consistent with natural lighting. This coherence across three views suggests the shadows and highlights are natural and consistent with the lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout in each of the three views (top, side, sectional) logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The three views in Image B cover different aspects of the baseball glove and ball: a top view for an overview layout, a side view for showing the gloveâ€™s full opening along with the ball, and a sectional detail to focus on specific elements such as stitching. Each view is logically designed to highlight the function and design details effectively, mimicking common presentation styles for similar products. Hence, the composition is visually credible and logically represents the items.",
