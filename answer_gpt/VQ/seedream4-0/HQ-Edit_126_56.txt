    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows mountain shapes that are constructed using geometric forms, specifically triangles and trapezoids. The edges are sharp and the shapes are regular, indicating a consistent geometric representation. This is common when simplifying complex forms into abstract art, which often uses geometric shapes to convey recognizable landscapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted using simplified, consistent geometric shapes such as triangles. These forms are clean and maintain a uniform appearance across the image, reflecting a stylized, abstract depiction that does not feature fragmented or irregular branching, which is typical in minimalist or geometric art styles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the river with parallel lines that radiate towards the horizon, aligned with the direction of water flow from foreground to background. The spacing of these lines appears uniform, aiding in visualizing the flow direction naturally within the context of the geometrical landscape, a typical approach in abstract representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the river does not mirror the elements above it perfectly. While the geometric shapes provide an ordered structure, they do not reflect back the elements like in a natural setting or mirror image. In abstract art, perfect symmetry in reflections is often simplified or artistically altered, which is evident here.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color block boundaries are clear and defined without any signs of blurring or feathering. The geometric shapes have sharp edges indicating high precision typical in vector-style digital art, which contrasts with visible pixelation or blurred edges in less precise graphical work.",
    "answer": "Yes"
