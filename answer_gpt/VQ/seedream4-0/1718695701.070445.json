    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B, the preservation of shapes such as the nose and mouth can be inferred from the unchanged location of the whiskers extending outward from the lower part of the face. The realistic depiction in bronze suggests careful preservation of original features, and knowledge that sculptures typically aim to protect key details aligns with this observation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the bronze helmet aligns naturally with the head's curvature. Smooth transitions and the absence of visible gaps indicate thoughtful scaling and positioning. Knowledge of sculpture usually avoids misalignments supports this conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze glasses maintain a proper fit over the eyes, suggesting accurate placement akin to traditional spectacles. However, the reflection and transparency typical of glass are absent due to the solidness of bronze, which alters its optical properties.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The observed sculpture in Image B keeps the garment shape intact, smoothly transitioning through curved engraved lines that resemble original fabric textures. The positioning of the shoulder strap appears unaltered, hinting at a faithful conversion from textile to metal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble base in Image B is positioned directly beneath the sculpture. The steady contact points show no visible gap, which is typical for supporting bases designed to provide structural stability. Knowledge of traditional sculptural mounts supports this observation of proportional sizing and placement for stability.",
