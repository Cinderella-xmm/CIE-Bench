      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character's arm and hand are cartoonish and stylized, typically featuring claws or simplified hand shapes rather than human-like fingers. Cartoon shrimp characters often do not have fingers, which means they lack natural human curvature or spacing, and the attachment to the body takes creative license with anatomy. There are no five fingers, highlighting this stylization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cartoon depiction, where realism in texture and shadow may defer to the stylistic choices of cartoon design. The chef's hat on the shrimp doesn't show realistic fabric creases or a textured surface consistent with real-world materials but follows the simplified design often seen in cartoons. Shadows and textures are minimal or stylized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character is depicted gripping a lemon slice, but due to the stylization, finger curvature and spacing are not realistically portrayed as in human anatomy. The lemon slice does appear to maintain a somewhat realistic wedge shape and cartoon-like surface texture, but the shrimp's grip does not showcase a natural human hand's form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is an illustration showing the shrimp in motion with lines suggesting movement and herbs around it. Cartoon illustrations typically use motion lines to convey direction, and here they seem aligned with the shrimp's movement. Herb particles appear to disperse logically around the shrimp, enhancing the visual storytelling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an artistic interpretation with shrimp arranged atop a pile. While the styling is playful, the shrimp tails are layered and seem gravity-consistent, avoiding floating or disconnected appearances. The arrangement, while whimsical, aligns with the depiction of a stable stack.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is designed to be clear and legible, typical of comic or graphic styles. Text placements do not overlap important visual elements, enhancing readability. The stroke thickness and style are consistent, maintaining a coherent visual presentation throughout the panels.",
