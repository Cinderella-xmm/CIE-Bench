    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the woman's face and body maintain natural proportions without exaggerated or distorted features such as uneven eyes, misplaced limbs, or unnatural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is depicted in a stylized, animated form, which naturally lends itself to certain exaggerations in proportions typical of animation styles. However, given the context, her body proportions, such as the placement of arms and the flow of the hanfu, appear consistent with the stylistic choices typical of such illustrations, avoiding unnatural distortions. The limbs and body maintain artistic coherence without awkward or unnatural placements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress enlarged proportionally without breaking their natural shape or causing jagged edges, and do the gold highlights blend seamlessly into the fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the dress are depicted smoothly, retaining their natural shapes consistent with an artistic representation. The gold highlights appear well-integrated into the fabric, enhancing the design without creating edges or disruptions. This reflects a coherent artistic rendering typical of animated styles where pattern fluidity and color integration are critical for visual appeal.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the radiant hues applied to the dress appear smooth and evenly distributed without visible color bleeding, unnatural glow artifacts, or disrupted fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dress with a consistent and smooth color application, a key feature in animation where uniform color distribution is critical. The hues are richly applied without obvious color bleeding or texture disruption. The absence of glow artifacts and the smooth gradient flow ensures that the colors blend seamlessly, an expected outcome in professional illustration work.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the abstract bamboo shadows align with the existing light source and cast believable depth without appearing detached, inconsistent, or overlapping incorrectly with the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast among the bamboo show a thoughtful consideration of the light source, aligning believably with it. The shadows create a sense of depth that is consistent with the animated setting, and they do not exhibit signs of misalignment or errant overlapping that would break the illusion of spatial coherence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bamboo-shaped writing panel positioned naturally within the scene, with smooth edges and watercolor motifs that match the surrounding textures and do not exhibit harsh lines or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bamboo-shaped writing panel is embedded naturally into the scene. The edges are smoothly rendered, maintaining an artistic continuity with the surrounding bamboo textures. The watercolor motifs on the panel further harmonize with the scene, avoiding harsh lines, which ensures a soft transition into the background and context of the illustration.",
