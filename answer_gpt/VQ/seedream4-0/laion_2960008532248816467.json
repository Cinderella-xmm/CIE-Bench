    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon face features eyes and a mouth smoothly integrated into the tart's surface. The expressions are aligned and consistent with the surrounding custard, demonstrating a uniform art style typical of illustrations. There are no visible disruptions or jagged edges affecting the cartoon face.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest creatures lining the crust rim in Image B are proportionally scaled to match the tart's size, appear correctly positioned on the crust's curve, and are rendered with a soft and cohesive texture indicative of a stylized art approach, without pixelation or artifacts.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the path starts at the base of the tart and seamlessly continues into the forest background. This path maintains consistent shading and perspective relative to the other elements in the scene, showing continuity without sharp edges or segments that appear out of place.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tartâ€™s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foliage and flowers in Image B are placed around the tart with realistic spatial arrangement, incorporating soft shading that fits the cheerful and vivid forest scene. There's no overlapping or clipping onto the tart, preserving scene coherence.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, Image A features standard cheese tarts, while Image B showcases a tart with cartoon additions. The tart in Image B maintains its foundational shape and structure, with no evidence of destructive edits or distortions. The alterations are additive (artistic face), respecting the tart's form.",
