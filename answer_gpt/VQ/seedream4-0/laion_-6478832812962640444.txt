    "Question": "Q1: Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a boot with a shiny metallic finish, where the areas that traditionally have stitched embroidery on leather boots have been transformed into smooth metallic surfaces. The reflective properties appear uniform, with no visible seams or interruptions in texture, indicating consistent application across the areas previously decorated by embroidery.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the heel design of the boot features a distinct stepped structure, which appears well-aligned with the boot's sole and shaft. The edges of the heel are sharp and geometrically precise, consistent with the high-quality reflective metallic surfaces, indicating careful alignment and structural coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
    "explanation": "The patterns on the boot in Image B feature crisp and well-defined geometric lines that follow the contours of the boot without any visible distortion. This design choice maintains the original shape of the boot, ensuring the outline looks natural and proportional without swelling or compression.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a boot with a metallic finish that consistently reflects light, producing uniform specular highlights. The consistent gloss and absence of digital irregularities indicate that the image does not suffer from over-processing, maintaining a realistic appearance of the metallic surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
    "explanation": "The profile of the boot in Image B retains a natural and proportionate shape, with each element – toe box, ankle, and shaft – reflecting standard boot proportions. There is no apparent elongation, compression, or asymmetry, which would disrupt the boot's functionality and aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
