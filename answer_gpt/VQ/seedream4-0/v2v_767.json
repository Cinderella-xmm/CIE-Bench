      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the creature added to the image appear naturally integrated with the temple and surrounding jungle, without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature, which resembles a temple integrated with animal-like features, such as a claw and tail, is positioned seamlessly with the temple structure. The textures and shading correspond well with the environment, suggesting an organic union without any jarring transitions or visible artifacts that detract from the overall scene. The color palette remains consistent with the rest of the image, enhancing the illusion of natural integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature's design reflect the temple's shape and textures accurately, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature, designed with elements of a traditional stepped pyramid temple, mirrors the architectural style of the temple. Its body seems to be a continuation of this structure, maintaining the geometric regularity and architectural motifs of the temple. The integration of appendages like claws does not appear to disrupt the temple's structural coherence, as they are blended into the same texture and style.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature's feet visually consistent with the temple's architectural details and natural elements, without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb features intricate designs reminiscent of the architectural detailing seen on the temple, maintaining consistency with its aesthetic. The colors and patterns on the orb are harmonious with the surrounding elements, ensuring that it does not stand out in an unnatural way. Additionally, the fine details of the orb are well-preserved, consistent with the level of detail found elsewhere in the image.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the creature and the custom-designed orb maintain the scene's overall authenticity and natural appearance, without disrupting the harmony of the jungle and temple setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has successfully integrated a fantastical creature that complements the temple's form without detracting from the natural aesthetics of the jungle scene. The creature's design aligns with the theme and appearance of ancient temples, contributing to the setting's authenticity. The natural textures and muted color palette ensure that the additions blend in well with the lush, detailed jungle backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the creature's invented name and elemental type displayed clearly beside or beneath it, without interfering with the visual quality or introducing any distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature's invented name and elemental type are presented in stylized text at the bottom of Image B. This information is arranged in a subtle, non-intrusive manner that complements rather than competes with the visual elements of the scene. The text matches the overall aesthetic and does not disrupt the image's visual quality, maintaining the scene's cohesion.",
