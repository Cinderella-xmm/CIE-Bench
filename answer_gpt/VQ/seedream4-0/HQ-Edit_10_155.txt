    "Question": "Q1: Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome surrounding the lantern appears to be transparent and smooth. The reflections and inside contents are clearly visible, indicating the glass is free of distortions or cracks. There are no unusual reflection or refraction patterns disrupting depth perception. Conclusion is drawn by observing the clear visibility of the inside elements through the dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows an arrangement of ceramic tiles at the base, and these appear to be uniformly sized and clearly defined. The color transitions are smooth, and there are no obvious signs of blurred or misaligned edges. This analysis is based on visual examination of the pavement's details, confirming its consistency and clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the textile merchants and their canopies are proportionately small relative to the lantern, which is expected for a diorama-like setting. The shapes and textures appear realistic, without signs of being stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused. This conclusion is derived from the relative size and distinct separation of figures and the lantern.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
    "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B have fronds that are appropriately shaped, and their bases appear rooted to the ground. Shadows created by the lantern's light source are consistent with the overall lighting, enhancing the realism. There is no indication of flatness or detachment, which suggests the elements are naturally integrated with the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the dome displays a textured and weathered appearance with variations in tone and depth. It does not exhibit uniform patterns or digital artifacts that might imply over-processing. The close inspection of the base's surface and the subtle color gradations confirm this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
