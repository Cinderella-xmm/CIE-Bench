      "question": "Is the treasure chest still geometrically intact and proportionally consistent with its original form when placed on the newly added weathered map background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest appears consistent with its geometry and proportions from Image A. It fits well into the map background without distortions. The visual cues indicate a coherent integration by preserving the structural design seen in the original image. When comparing with Image A, the chest retains its shape and proportions, showing an effective placement onto the map background.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ropes bordering the map maintain a natural appearance, with fiber textures and realistic coil shapes visible. They have not been stretched or distorted, appearing intact and consistent with rope characteristics. Image A features similar rope textures, reinforcing the accurate portrayal in Image B.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents symbols and text with proper alignment, fitting well within the weathered map theme. They appear cleanly rendered, with no noticeable jagged edges or color bleeding. The integration suggests precision in design and depth matching the visual style.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the compass rose displays a metallic sheen and shadowing characteristic of the lighting seen around the coins and gems. The visual cues show alignment with the surrounding elements, reflecting understanding of metallic properties and lighting effects. Comparatively, Image A illustrates similar lighting and shadowing techniques, supporting consistency in Image B.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea monster motifs in Image B are seamlessly blended into the map background. Line thickness and shading are consistent, fitting well with other ink drawings.
