      "question": "Does the 3D voxel-style model of the mouse retain a natural texture similar to the original mouse's fur without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse is represented in a 3D voxel style, characterized by a blocky and pixelated design, which doesn't aim to mimic the natural texture of an actual mouse's fur. The style is inherently unnatural, using geometric shapes that lack the softness and detailed texture of real fur. Therefore, the model does not retain a natural texture similar to the real mouse.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the mouse's body parts in the 3D voxel-style model consistent with its original form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the mouse in Image B, its body parts such as head, ears, and legs are proportioned in a way that mirrors the original form in Image A, but are simplified into voxel blocks. Despite the style being different, the proportions appear to match the original mouse's general anatomy and are not distorted or deformed in a way that disrupts physical rationality.",

      "question": "Do the edges and surfaces of the 3D voxel-style mouse model appear smooth and coherent, without any jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D model in Image B is constructed in a voxel style, which is inherently blocky and characterized by distinct cubes or pixels. This style produces clear edges and surfaces as a stylistic choice, rather than smooth, continuous surfaces. However, there are no jagged or broken shapes inconsistent with the cohesive voxel design.",

      "question": "Does the interaction between the 3D voxel-style mouse model and the smartphone look plausible and realistic, without any unnatural positioning or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D voxel-style mouse model is placed near the smartphone, similar to Image A. The alignment and shadow placement appear consistent with the expected lighting and spatial arrangement, offering a plausible interaction between the mouse and the smartphone within the stylistic constraints.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the mouse's features, such as whiskers and eyes, preserved in the 3D voxel-style model without any loss or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D voxel-style model in Image B simplifies the mouse into blocky components, which means fine details like whiskers and eyes are represented in a minimalistic manner. While the eyes are distinctly represented as black pixels, the whiskers are present but recreated with voxel sticks. The detail is not the same as in the original image, reflecting a stylized alteration rather than degradation.",
