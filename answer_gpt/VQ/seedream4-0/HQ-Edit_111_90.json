      "question": "Are the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the transformed necklace clearly defined and free from geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the necklace appear intricate and detailed. The gemstones are symmetrically aligned and the metal patterns exhibit a refined structure, indicating precision and lack of distortion. The visual analysis shows that the patterns maintain high clarity and symmetry, which suggests that they are free from any geometric distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original scaly texture and smooth curvature as it emerges from the mossy bank without sudden breaks or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the snake tail emerging from the mossy bank. The texture appears consistent with what is expected of snake scales, showing uniformity across its length. The curvature of the tail is smooth, without any abrupt changes or bends, which supports the notion of a natural and uninterrupted form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually transparent with consistent reflections and refractions across its surface, showing no jagged edges or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is depicted as transparent, allowing clear viewing of its contents. The surface exhibits consistent reflections and refractions indicative of a high level of visual realism. There are no visible jagged edges or digital artifacts interfering with the dome's clarity, suggesting high-quality rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the emerald pond display natural water surface details such as subtle ripples and reflections, and are the silver leaves evenly shaped with consistent metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the emerald pond with water surface details like subtle ripples and reflections that suggest natural water movement. Additionally, the silver leaves surrounding the pond are uniformly shaped with consistent metallic highlights, presenting a coherent and realistic appearance without irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ornate branches supporting the chandelier proportionally sized and shaped to resemble natural plant structures without angular breaks or unnatural joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B support the chandelier and are artistically designed to resemble natural structures. They flow smoothly without angular breaks, and the shapes maintain a realistic aspect, adhering to the proportion and curvature typical of plant branches seen in nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the new elements (pond, leaves, branches, dome) properly overlap and interact with the original necklace and snake tail without floating disjointedly or violating depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates the pond, leaves, branches, and dome with the original necklace and snake tail. These elements interact seamlessly, respecting visual depth and spatial relationships. There are no signs of disjointed placement; each component relates and overlaps naturally, maintaining visual depth cues effectively.",
