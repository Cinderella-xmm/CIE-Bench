      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shell-like body of the creature have consistent curvature and smooth surface transitions without visible cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's shell-like body appears to be closed and naturally curved with smooth surface transitions. This is evident from the uniform spiral pattern and lack of visible distortions or misalignments in its structure. The visual cues, along with world knowledge about shells and spiral organisms, suggest that the body is consistent without visible imperfections.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the coral-like spires distributed organically along the back of the creature, with varying heights and irregular shapes that resemble natural coral formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coral-like spires on the creature's back in Image B exhibit varying heights and shapes, which is characteristic of organic coral formations. They are placed in a seemingly random yet balanced manner, mimicking the randomness observed in natural growth patterns of coral reefs. This assessment is based on the comparison with known coral structures in nature that are irregular and diverse.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing sea guardian spirits emit soft, diffused light that originates from their bodies and does not produce sharp halos or isolated bright spots outside their forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing sea guardian spirits on the creature exhibit a soft, diffused glow, with light gently emanating from their bodies instead of forming sharp halos or isolated bright spots externally. Considering the way light is often handled in artistic depictions where it appears smooth and entwined with the subject, the glow here seems to be integrated naturally with the spirits, providing a seamless visual transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flow smoothly in the same direction as the original wake, with colors transitioning gradually from warm orange to deep red matching the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature appears to flow in a consistent direction with the original wake from Image A. However, instead of transitioning from warm orange to deep red, the glow transitions through cooler tones such as blue and turquoise that are not typical of the sunset colors seen in the original sky. This mismatch suggests a deviation in color harmony.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature cast a faint shadow on the water surface beneath it, and are its illuminated parts consistent with the direction of sunlight from the setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadow effects in Image B do not appear to be consistent with the direction of sunlight given by the sunset in the background. There's no clear indication of a shadow cast on the water beneath it, nor do the illuminated parts of the creature seem to align uniformly with the expected light direction from the setting sun, leading to inconsistencies with natural shadowing and light logic.",
