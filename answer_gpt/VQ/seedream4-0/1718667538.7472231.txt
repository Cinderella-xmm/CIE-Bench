    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the tiger's face are noted for their precision and clarity. The lines exhibit uniform thickness, which lends the design a polished, clean appearance. Additionally, there is an absence of pixelation or broken lines which could suggest poor rendering. This suggests a deliberate, high-quality digital editing process, contrasting with Image A where textures appear fur-like and more intricate.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono panels are distinctly structured into layers with defined, clean edges. This separation contributes to an organized appearance, indicative of thoughtful design. The lack of overlapping or floating elements points to careful digital manipulation ensuring coherent presentation. Image A displays a more natural flow of fabric, emphasizing texture over layered structure.",
