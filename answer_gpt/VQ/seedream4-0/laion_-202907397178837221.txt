    "Question": "Q1: Do the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers align precisely with the original building outlines, showing no distorted edges or misaligned blocks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers have been edited with pixel patterns, likely intended to give them a futuristic or digital appearance. The buildings retain their structural outline from Image A, indicating a deliberate placement of these patterns. The lack of distorted edges or misaligned blocks suggests careful editing. Given that the pixel patterns appear neatly aligned with the building outlines, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the angular digital circuits forming the trees connected logically from base to tip, with no floating or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trees have been transformed into angular digital circuits, resembling a network flow or motherboard layout. Using world knowledge, logical connections in circuits should flow smoothly and continuously. The image shows a cohesive circuit pattern from base to tip, aligned with the understanding that digital circuits should not have floating or disconnected elements. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the neon lights along the bridge run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels without gaps or incorrect bends?",
    "explanation": "Neon lights in digital or futuristic edits typically emphasize continuity and clean lines. Analysis of Image B indicates that the neon effects are consistently applied along the bridge, adhering to its structure without breaks or unnatural bends. This approach is consistent with maintaining visual integrity and technological aesthetics. The answer is therefore Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are all skyscrapers in the skyline uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, with no partial or missing conversions?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases pixel-patterned facades applied to skyscrapers, creating a uniform luminous effect across the skyline. Upon examination, each tower in the skyline has undergone this conversion, with none appearing only partially altered or entirely missing the transformation. This uniformity fits the typical style of digital edits, leading to the answer Yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the window grids on the buildings, the individual beams of the bridge, and the foliage of non-digital trees still clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the pixel and neon edits are prominent; however, due to heavy digital alterations, features such as window grids on buildings, beams of the bridge, and foliage detail have been obscured. The visual clarity and distinct visibility of these elements are not upheld post-editing, indicating distortion. The answer to this is No.",
    "answer": "No"
