      "question": "Does the shell maintain its original pattern and texture without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell has been transformed into a part of the character design, resembling a backpack. It no longer maintains the detailed texture and pattern typical of a real tortoise shell seen in Image A. Instead, it has a stylized appearance, which is common in character designs to fit an aesthetic theme, such as the chibi character style portrayed here. The original realistic texture and fine details are sacrificed in favor of a more simplistic and cartoonish style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added clothing items and accessories such as glasses, sketchbook, and footwear integrated seamlessly without causing any distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added clothing items and accessories in Image B, including the glasses, sketchbook, and shoes, fit well with the character's design. They maintain a uniform style and color palette that complements the character's aesthetic. The accessories do not introduce any distortions or textures that would appear out of place in a stylized illustration. This coherence suggests careful integration into the character design.",

      "question": "Do the long legs of the turtle appear structurally coherent and physically rational, avoiding any unnatural bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's legs are extended in a stylized manner typical of certain animation styles, specifically exaggerated features in chibi or cartoon designs. Although they do not match the natural proportions seen in Image A, where a tortoise's legs are short and fit its body, within the context of stylized illustration, the legs appear coherent and intentional. There are no signs of unnatural bending or awkward/stretch marks, indicating a deliberate artistic choice.",

      "question": "Are the small accessories like the scarf or designer bag proportionate and well-placed, contributing to the overall natural appearance without introducing any artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small accessories, such as the scarf and designer bag in Image B, are thoughtfully rendered in proportion to the character. They are placed in a manner that feels intentional and appropriate for the style. The accessories do not introduce visual artifacts or inconsistencies, which contributes positively to the character's cohesive look.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the solid background color consistent and harmonious with the characterâ€™s color scheme, enhancing the visual plausibility without any gradient or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid color that complements the character's warm color scheme, consisting mainly of browns and beiges. The absence of gradients or textures is typical for stylized character designs, focusing attention on the main subject. Therefore, the background enhances the visual coherence of the image without any unnecessary artifactual details.",
