      "question": "Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe appears to have naturally flowing fabric, which drapes around the seated figure smoothly. The folds of the robe follow the body's contour logically, without showing any signs of unnatural stretching or awkward clumping. This observation is consistent with common artistic practices in illustrations, where fabric is depicted with a degree of realism in terms of its natural flow.",

      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized illustration, where the seated figure's limbs and joints are rendered in a simplified and stylized manner. Despite the stylization, the limbs appear proportionate and the angles of the joints seem natural, reflecting an understanding of basic anatomy, ensuring no distortions or awkward proportions, even in an artistic context.",

      "question": "Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure features a stylized depiction commonly found in artistic illustrations, which often include enlarged eye features to emphasize expression or style. Even so, these facial features integrate harmoniously within the overall composition, ensuring the face maintains an appropriate balance and coherence without causing distortion to surrounding facial features.",

      "question": "Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) utilizes watercolor techniques, showcasing soft, blended transitions in the reflections of the mountains and lakes. These transitions lack sharp edges and are consistent with natural, gentle brushstroke artistry typical of watercolor paintings, enhancing the serene and artistic feel of the illustration.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a neat application of the lilac-edged border. This border is uniformly applied around the scenes within the image, maintaining consistency and avoiding any overlap or obscuration of the depicted scenery. This uniformity reflects a meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that the border complements rather than detracts from the visual content.",
