    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's limbs are clearly depicted with a cartoonish style. The zig-zag motion lines are a common artistic element in illustrations to convey movement or action. Despite the stylization, the limbs are proportionally similar to human anatomy. The arms and legs do not show any unnatural bends or distortions, indicating a careful illustration that maintains human anatomical consistency while adding dynamic elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spacesuit has an artistic embellishment with celestial motifs. The texture and shading appear uniform, blending well with the illustrated material of the suit. The motifs are part of a consistent pattern that fits the style and does not show any visible seams or artifacts, indicating well-executed integration into the illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the astronaut standing on a stylized version of the moon surface, which is consistent with the artistic design of the image. The ground under the astronaut's feet appears correctly aligned in terms of depth, scale, and perspective. There are no visible gaps or misalignments between the boots of the astronaut and the moon surface, maintaining the intended illustration coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
    "explanation": "This question cannot be fully addressed as the face is blurred in the image, which prevents evaluation of facial proportions or feature alignment. Typically, a well-illustrated face would have symmetrical features and defined lines, but the blurring precludes such analysis in Image B.",
    "answer": "N/A"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the space-themed border is evenly aligned around the edges of the image. It does not overlap or cut into any of the main elements, such as the astronaut or the background space scene. The texture of the border simulates card stock, providing a consistent appearance without evident repetition, maintaining visual integrity and aesthetic quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
