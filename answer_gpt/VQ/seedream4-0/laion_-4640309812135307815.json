      "question": "Does the transformed bottle maintain the same elongated vertical silhouette as the original dress, with no compression or stretching of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed bottle exhibits an elongated, vertical silhouette, maintaining a similar form to the original dress in Image A. The dress in Image A featured a fitted design that extended from the bodice to the floor, creating a vertical and elegant silhouette. This essence is preserved in the bottle shape in Image B, with the added resemblance of a flared bottom similar to a dress train. Therefore, the silhouette is maintained without significant compression or stretching.",
