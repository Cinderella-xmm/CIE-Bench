      "question": "Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and roof supports are stylized, with elements reflecting an Art Deco influence, characterized by sharp, clean, and angular edges. The geometric precision and metallic look suggest a deliberate design choice for consistency without any warping or fracturing. Art Deco design typically emphasizes symmetrical and geometric patterns, contributing to the clean appearance of these structural elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants are depicted with a strong Art Deco style, focusing on symmetrical and repeating geometric patterns. This style often features repeated motifs arranged meticulously to maintain balance and conformity. The depiction doesn't include irregular spacing or fragmented shapes, consistent with the geometric and stylized nature of Art Deco.",

      "question": "Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces are rendered to simulate metallic gold and silver, typical of Art Deco style, showing a consistent sheen and reflection. This style often incorporates metallic colors to highlight luxury and opulence, achieved here with precise color application that avoids bleeding and includes detailed texture work to maintain the integrity of the metallic look.",

      "question": "Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the windowâ€™s structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are drawn with smooth, flowing outlines above the horizon, fitting an artistic representation. The window frames exhibit bold, angular lines that fit within the rigid, geometric design principles characteristic of the Art Deco style. These architectural elements maintain their structural integrity within the visual theme, ensuring alignment without any breakage.",
