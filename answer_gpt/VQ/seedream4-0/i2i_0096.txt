    "Question": "Q1:Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is seen at an angle that includes both a frontal and a side view. The structural integrity appears consistent across these perspectives, showing no abnormal deformations. The proportions are realistic and in alignment with typical sofa construction, where the back, seating area, and arms maintain coherence in size and placement. This assessment is assisted by understanding standard sofa construction where such harmony is desirable for aesthetic and functional purposes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The fabric texture and details on the sofa in Image B appear consistent and uniform across both views. From the scene, the material looks like what would be expected of a high-quality sofa, typically smooth and retaining detail under varying light angles. This uniformity indicates consistent image quality with no unnatural smoothing or degradation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the placement and alignment of the cushions and sofa legs are plausible and consistent across both the frontal and side perspectives. Common sofa design logic is represented, where cushions complement the structure and legs provide firm support. The logic reflects everyday furniture layout, ensuring that the pieces are cohesive and realistic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light and shadow effects applied to the sofa and surrounding areas are consistent and appear realistic. The light source from the window influences these effects, suggesting a coherent theme in lighting conditions, adhering to principles of light behavior such as diffusion and reflection over surfaces, maintaining a natural aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the artwork and wall present a natural and believable appearance from both views. The painting retains its shape and vibrancy, and the wall remains uniformly textured and aligned with common interior design standards. Such consistency is typical and expected in maintaining room aesthetics, supporting realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
