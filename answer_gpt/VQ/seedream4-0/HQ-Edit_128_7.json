      "question": "Do the swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower maintain consistent geometric continuity without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the swirling cloud-like structures appear smooth and continuous, indicating a cohesive integration into the tower's design. There are no visible jagged edges or breaks that disrupt their form, highlighting a consistent geometric flow. This aligns with natural physics and aesthetics, suggesting they were designed to seamlessly blend into the structure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the luminescent runes aligned with the wood grain and carving details, and do they emit light without creating unnatural halos or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent runes are seen glowing on the crystalline structure rather than being aligned with wood grain or carvings, unlike in wooden structures. The runes emit a consistent glow with smooth edges, avoiding any unnatural halos or pixelation. This suggests attention to detail in the edited design to maintain the mystical ethereal appearance commonly associated with luminescent symbols.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shimmering crystal spires reflect light naturally, showing subtle variations in transparency and surface highlights consistent with real crystal under daylight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal spires in Image B appear to reflect light naturally, consistent with real crystal properties. They display subtle transparency and highlight variations, which mimic how real crystals would behave under direct sunlight, showcasing a realistic crystallographic quality.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing celestial orbs centered and securely attached to the tips of the spires, maintaining proportional scale and alignment with the architectural axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the glowing celestial orbs are well-positioned at the tips of the crystal spires. They appear centered and proportionate, aligning with the spires' architectural axis. This precise placement ensures the visual harmony and balance of the image, adhering to architectural norms.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the silver spiral trees maintain three-dimensional volume and proper shadowing, appearing solid rather than transparent or two-dimensional?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows silver spiral figures which, while not trees, appear as artistic elements with depth. They have volumetric qualities and appropriate shadows, providing the perception of three-dimensionality and solidity. The design avoids a flat or transparent appearance, enhancing the visual depth within the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ghostly bird apparitions semi-transparent with smooth feather outlines and consistent motion direction, without fragmented or duplicated body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird apparitions in Image B are semi-transparent, with smooth edge detailing that suggest their ghostly form. They all appear to follow a consistent directional motion across the sky, creating a unified and cohesive element in the image. There are no visible issues like fragmented or duplicated body parts that would detract from their representation.",
