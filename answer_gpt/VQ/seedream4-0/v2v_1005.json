      "question": "Do the facial features and accessories of the individuals appear detailed and clear despite the enlarged heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individuals have been transformed into cartoonish characters, resulting in a style that features simplified facial features and accessories. This is typical of such characters, which often have a more stylized and less detailed appearance compared to realistic images.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transition between the enlarged heads and the cartoonish bodies smooth and free from noticeable artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the enlarged heads and the cartoonish bodies appears smooth and consistent with typical cartoon character design, where exaggerated proportions do not show visible artifacts, maintaining a cohesive appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the individuals' bodies in relation to the log cabin realistic and consistent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts cartoon characters with enlarged heads and simplified bodies. While this style is common in animations and pop art, it is not meant to be realistic. The proportions are deliberately stylized, making them inconsistent with realistic depictions concerning the log cabin.",

      "question": "Do the clothing and equipment retain their natural textures and details without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and equipment have been transformed into a cartoonish style, which inherently simplifies and smooths out textures and details as part of its aesthetic, rather than maintaining the naturalistic textures seen in real-life representations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the individuals' bodies and the log cabin intact and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric shapes of the individuals' bodies and the log cabin are preserved within the cartoon style. The simplified and rounded forms typical of cartoon design are consistent and smooth, thus not appearing distorted within this context.",
