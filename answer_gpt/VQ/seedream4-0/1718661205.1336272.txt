    "Question": "Q1: Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays a LEGO representation of a military ship. The LEGO model appears to maintain the original shape and structural proportions quite effectively. LEGO pieces are known for their precise interlocking capabilities, and the ship’s structure reflects this consistency without noticeable distortions or misaligned bricks.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO ocean waves are constructed using varied heights and placements of LEGO pieces to create a textured effect. This technique captures the undulating nature of waves, signifying an attempt to mimic natural wave motion rather than being completely flat or rigid.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO model placed on a shelf, which is depicted with clear structural integrity and spatial coherence. The lighting and shadows on the shelf and model give depth cues that enhance the realism of the geometric arrangement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO model is constructed cleanly without observable artifacts like jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces. This ensures the illusion of a coherent and complete LEGO build is maintained.",
    "answer": "No"
