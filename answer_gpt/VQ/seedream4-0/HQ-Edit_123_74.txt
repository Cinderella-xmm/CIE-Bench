    "Question": "Q1: Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet appears slightly larger due to the stylized nature of the image, which features paper-cut visual effects. However, it maintains a coherent shape consistent with typical helmet designs. The helmet's placement on the head is realistic, as there are no visual cues indicating deformation or unnatural edges, maintaining a smooth integration into the overall image.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
    "explanation": "Image B features vivid red tones in the snowsuit that are consistent with the stylized paper cut aesthetic. While the texture is simplified in appearance, the color remains integrated with the visual style, avoiding glossiness or pixelation. The snowsuit's vibrant color is appropriate for the intended paper-like texture without disconnecting from the underlying material imagery.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow and tree outlines are stylized to resemble paper cuts, showing clear separation into layered shapes. The visual representation adheres to clean edges without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments, effectively illustrating the artistic technique of paper cut landscapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
