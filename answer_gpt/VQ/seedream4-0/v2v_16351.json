      "question": "Are the lockers in the background seamlessly replaced with mid-century modern showroom elements without visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of lockers, the background features sleek, wooden paneling with mid-century modern style elements like a neutral-colored couch and designer chairs. The textures and colors appear consistent with a showroom setting, without any visible artifacts or unnatural blending at the borders of these elements. The design is smooth and cohesive, making it a plausible replacement for the lockers.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jersey display is replaced by a contemporary couch and chairs, which are scale-consistent with the characters and the overall space.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in both images are engaged in what seems to be a discussion, with Arm gestures that suggest explanation or presentation.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and consistent with a modern showroom ambiance, providing even illumination across the room.

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the characters' clothing—consisting of sports jerseys and suits—remains unchanged. This includes the colors, designs, and textures of their clothing. The other elements like the background and jersey display are the only altered elements, keeping the characters visually consistent.",
