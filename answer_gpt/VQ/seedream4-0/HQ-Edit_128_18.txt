    "Question": "Q2: Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the animal footprints on the floor are arranged in a way that suggests a playful or decorative intent rather than an accurate representation of an animal's gait. The footprints do not form a continuous, logical path that would be consistent with an actual giraffe or similar animal movement. Instead, they appear more artificial or stylized, which is common in decorative room settings aimed at children.",

Moreover, there is subtle distortion of the toy's shape beneath the packaging, which aligns with how plastic wrap interacts with light and object shapes in reality. The details in the design suggest a realistic depiction of plastic packaging.",
