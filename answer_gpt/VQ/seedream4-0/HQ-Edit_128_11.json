      "question": "Does the enhanced chandelier retain its symmetrical structure and realistic crystal texture, with no visible distortion or irregularities in its shape or lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chandelier appears to maintain a clear symmetrical structure, with no visible distortion. The crystal texture is realistic, with light reflections consistent and natural, similar to what one would expect from a well-lit chandelier. This conclusion is drawn from the visual clarity of the symmetry and the characteristic luminous sparkle of the crystals.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the newly added patterns on the ceiling consistent in style and scale with the existing decorative elements, and do they blend seamlessly without creating visual breaks or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceiling patterns in Image B appear to be in harmony with the ornate style of the surrounding elements. The consistency in design and scale suggests seamless integration, as there are no visible breaks or stark edges that might contrast with the existing decorations. This observation is based on the stylistic coherence visible across the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouette figures in the audience retain recognizable human postures and relative spacing, avoiding unnatural clustering or elongation that would compromise spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouette figures in the audience in Image B maintain recognizable human postures and are spaced in a manner that avoids overcrowding or unusual elongation. This logical distribution mirrors typical audience arrangements in theaters, supporting the spatial logic observed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone evenly applied across all surfaces, maintaining visible texture differences between materials such as the wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling, without introducing muddy or oversaturated areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia tone in Image B seems to be evenly applied, offering distinct texture differentiation between the wooden stage, the piano, and the ceiling. No muddy or oversaturated areas are visible, suggesting careful application that preserves the visual integrity of varied material surfaces.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano appears correctly centered with an accurate perspective, displaying its intact legs and natural shadowing aligned with the chandelier's light source. The absence of deformation or floating appearance suggests the adherence to realistic portrayal observed.",
