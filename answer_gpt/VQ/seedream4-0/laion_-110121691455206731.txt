    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is anthropomorphized but does not have traditional facial features like eyes or a mouth. Instead, it uses arms to gesture, with speech bubbles for expression. This design choice ensures that the numerals and subdials remain unobscured and the metallic texture is unaffected, avoiding unnatural shading or edges around fictitious facial features.",
