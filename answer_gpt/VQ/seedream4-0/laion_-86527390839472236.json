      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a tall, rectangular silhouette with smooth, continuous vertical sides and no visible warping or collapsed edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an object with a tall, rectangular shape, and the vertical sides are smooth and continuous. The edges are straight with no signs of warping or collapsing. This can be concluded by observing the sharpness and alignment of the sides, which reflects a standard rectangular silhouette known for stability and symmetry.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the retractable handle replaced by a metallic spray nozzle that appears seamlessly attached to the top of the vessel, with no visible seams or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a metallic spray nozzle present at the top, which appears to be seamlessly integrated into the vessel's design. This observation suggests a well-designed alteration, as there are no visible seams or gaps between the nozzle and the vessel, indicating consistency in design aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are the fabric panels replaced with translucent purple-tinted glass that shows uniform translucency and clearly defined embossed linear patterns matching the original seam locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays translucent purple-tinted glass with uniformly distributed translucency. The glass exhibits embossed linear patterns, which are neatly defined. The observation of consistent structure and even integration of design elements suggests this transformation maintains the integrity of the original seam locations as described.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays decorative caps located at the corners of the base. They appear solid and polished with no visible mechanical parts. Their symmetry indicates careful attention to ensuring uniformity and aesthetic balance, reflecting similar characteristics as the previous wheels but with a decorative emphasis.",
