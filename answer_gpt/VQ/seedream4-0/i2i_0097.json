      "question": "Does the addition of the text “Master Chef” and “Final Round” appear naturally integrated without disrupting the overall visual balance of the plate and spoon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' are positioned above the plate and spoon, effectively utilizing the empty space without interfering with the central focus of the spoon and plate. The choice of bold, black font provides good contrast against the white background, aiding in seamless integration. This placement maintains the visual balance as the text is confined to the top, complementing the centered spoon and plate without overshadowing them.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is large enough to ensure easy readability while being appropriately scaled in relation to the central plate and spoon, maintaining a nice proportion with the entire image composition.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
