    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes and mouth appear to follow the design from Image A, maintaining similar positioning and proportions. The stylization in Image B keeps the essence of the original plush design, ensuring that these features are consistent. Image A, the original plush, has eyes and mouth placed centrally on the face, and this has been preserved in Image B despite the stylized cartoon rendering.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a simplified, cartoon version of the horse and its base.

While they retain the essential form and function seen in Image A, the proportions are not accurately consistent with the original mechanical structure due to stylization.",
