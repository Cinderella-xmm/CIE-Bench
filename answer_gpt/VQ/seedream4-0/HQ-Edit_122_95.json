      "question": "Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the saree appears to be translated into a mosaic format featuring the mosaic tiles or tesserae uniformly placed with consistent size and alignment. There are no visible seams or parts where the tiles are distorted, showcasing precision in the mosaic work which is characteristic of traditional mosaic artistry.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the building appears as a mosaic, and while the elements are represented in mosaic form, the overall geometry, including the arches and dome, retains straight edges and consistent curvature upon viewing. The structure is translated well into the mosaic pattern without any breaks or misalignment, hence maintaining its architectural coherence.",

      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and joint alignment, and no extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the hands depicted in a mosaic pattern show five fingers each. The fingers display natural spacing and correct joint alignment without extra digits or unnatural bending, maintaining a realistic portrayal within the constraints of mosaic art.",

      "question": "Are the floral motifs evenly distributed and proportionally sized relative to the surrounding architecture, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the mosaic-style edited image, the floral motifs are integrated into the design with even distribution. They are proportionally sized and do not appear to float or overlap incorrectly with the architectural elements, maintaining harmony within the image.",

      "question": "Does the golden backdrop exhibit smooth gradient transitions and subtle surface variations, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a golden mosaic backdrop. Although mosaic art might naturally have distinctions between tiles, the image efficiently shows smooth transitions and subtle variations without abrupt color changes, thus creating a visually consistent backdrop.",
