      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its structural integrity with no signs of distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter appears well-defined and consistent, without any noticeable distortions or irregular textures. Its structural elements like the dome top, coin slot, and display are clear and precise. Based on this visual information, the parking meter maintains its integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transition between the parking meter and the new desert highway background smooth and devoid of visible edges or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter is placed against a desert highway background. The transition looks seamless; there are no visible outlines or breaks indicating where the parking meter was digitally placed into the new setting. The light and shadows on the meter do not reveal any cut-out edges, which suggests a smooth integration with the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting effects on the parking meter match what would be expected in a desert setting under bright sunlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the parking meter shows a high contrast, typical of bright sunlight. The sun flare at the top of the meter matches the intensity one would expect in a desert environment. The shadows are directed and soft, resembling the effects of sunlight in an open and sunny setting. This suggests the lighting application is consistent with a desert scenario.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any irregular or unnatural shapes in the desert landscape that seem out of place or disrupt the scene's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desert landscape visible in the background appears typical, with a smooth transition from the road to the sandy landscape. There are no unusual or distorted shapes that seem out of place. The consistent appearance of the landscape supports the authenticity of the desert setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parking meter appear naturally placed in the desert highway setting without looking misplaced or awkward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the unusual concept of a parking meter being situated on a desert highway, the image integration itself is natural. Visually, the meter's robust positioning and consistent lighting contribute to a cohesive scene, without any awkwardness or signs of poor editing.",
