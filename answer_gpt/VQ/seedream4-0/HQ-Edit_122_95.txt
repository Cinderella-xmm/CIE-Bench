    "Question": "Q2: Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the building appears as a mosaic, and while the elements are represented in mosaic form, the overall geometry, including the arches and dome, retains straight edges and consistent curvature upon viewing. The structure is translated well into the mosaic pattern without any breaks or misalignment, hence maintaining its architectural coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
