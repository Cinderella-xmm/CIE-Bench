      "question": "Do the vertical towers now resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture and leaf coverage, without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical towers of the bridge have been transformed into what appear to be tree limb-like structures. They exhibit a natural bark texture and are covered with leaves, which gives them an organic and cohesive appearance. There are no visible seams or unnatural geometric distortions that would typically suggest a man-made structure, thereby successfully integrating a tree-like look into the design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches now formed into a continuous ribcage structure with natural curvature and spacing, free from broken or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the arches have been creatively reimagined into a ribcage-like structure. The ribs display a seamless natural curvature, suggestive of a cohesive skeletal form. The segments of these ribs align perfectly without breaks or misalignments, maintaining continuity and enhancing the appearance of an organic entity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the suspension cables been replaced with vine-like tendrils that show natural growth patterns, such as twisting or clinging, and do they blend with the forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the suspension cables are depicted as vine-like tendrils. These tendrils exhibit natural growth patterns typical of vines, including twisting and clinging to the tree limb structures. This change effectively blends the mechanism with the surrounding forest environment, creating a harmonious integration with nature.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bridgeâ€™s foundations now consist of moss-covered roots extending into the stream, with natural branching and tapering, rather than solid stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the bridge foundations appear to be composed of roots that are covered with moss. These roots demonstrate natural branching and tapering as they extend into the stream, replacing the original solid stone foundation with an organic appearance that integrates seamlessly with the forest setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bark-textured head structure with two glowing emerald eyes positioned at the top of the bridge, with the glow confined and not causing light bleed or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a structure resembling a head with a bark texture is present at the top of the bridge. This head features two glowing emerald eyes. The glow is contained within the eyes and does not create any spillover of light or unnatural highlights, maintaining a confined and effective illumination that complements the rest of the structure.",
