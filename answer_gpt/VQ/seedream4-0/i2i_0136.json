      "question": "Does the orange retain a realistic glossy texture without unnatural or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts an object with a very smooth, glossy surface that appears synthetic, rather than resembling the natural texture of a real orange. The surface lacks the dimpled, uneven texture typical of real oranges. Instead, it appears uniformly shiny and smooth, characteristics of a manufactured material like plastic, without any pixelated artifacts. Hence, while it has a glossy finish, it does not mimic the natural texture of an orange.",

      "question": "Is the stem of the orange well-integrated into the rubber keychain design, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object resembles a manufactured plastic keychain rather than a real orange. The stem is depicted as a simple green protrusion, differing significantly from the natural appearance of an orange stem. It looks more like a stylized version of a stem, with less detail and realism. Therefore, while it is well-integrated into the design as a keychain, it doesn't maintain a natural appearance akin to that of a real stem.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and shape of the keychain maintain a believable keychain structure, avoiding any distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a spherical object with smooth and regular geometry. The shape is consistent with a typical round object such as a rubber toy or keychain, without any strange distortions or disproportional elements. This makes it believable as a keychain. The design appears intentional and practical for a keychain structure.",

      "question": "Does the color of the orange keychain accurately reflect a citrus hue, contributing to the authenticity and visual credibility of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color of the object in Image B is a vivid orange, which is a typical color associated with citrus fruits like oranges. This ensures that the keychain keeps a semblance of authenticity and is easily recognizable as a representation of an orange. The hue is vibrant and matches commonly accepted color standards for an orange object.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the rubber keychain material and the orange's surface seamless, contributing to overall visual coherence and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is entirely synthetic, with a consistency in material appearance and glossy finish. It doesn't exhibit a transition from one material type to another, maintaining a cohesive visual experience throughout. This seamlessness in material appearance adds to the plausibility of the object being a designed rubber keychain.",
