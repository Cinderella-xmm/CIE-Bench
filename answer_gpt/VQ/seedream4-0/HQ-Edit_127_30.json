      "question": "Does the transformed violin body maintain consistent surface texture and lighting behavior with a high-quality engraved case, without unnatural sheen or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is showcased inside a case with a rich velvet interior. The surface of the violin appears smooth and glossy, reflecting light in a manner consistent with a well-polished instrument. The lighting is subtly diffused across the surface, indicating a professional finish without unnatural sheen. The velvet's texture in the case complements the reflective sheen of the violin, maintaining a high-quality appearance overall. Thus, the lighting behavior and texture are consistently aligned, showing no signs of a mismatch.",

      "question": "Are the gold accents on the chinrest and tailpiece seamlessly integrated with no visible seams, unnatural reflections, or color bleeding into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a violin with gold accents that appear well-integrated into the overall design. The chinrest and tailpiece with gold elements have clean edges and smoothly transition into the wooden parts of the violin, suggesting precision in overlay or manufacturing. There are no visible seams that could suggest poor integration, nor are there unnatural reflections or color bleeding that may distort the visual quality. Gold reflects light uniformly without being excessively bright or diffuse.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scripted font along the strings clearly legible, aligned with string curvature, and free from distortion or floating effects that suggest digital overlay errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scripted font visible in Image B is placed along the surface of the violin under the strings. The inscription is clear and legible, following the natural curvature of the instrument's body. The text does not exhibit any visual discrepancies such as distortion or unnatural alignment with the strings. This suggests that the font is intricately designed to match the surface, eliminating common digital overlay errors like floating effects or distortions.",

      "question": "Does the newly designed pedestal stand have proportionally correct legs and decorative elements that match the vintage aesthetic without appearing undersized, misaligned, or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal stand is ornately designed with a vintage aesthetic, featuring carved decorative elements. The stand appears proportionate in relation to the size of the violin case it supports. Its legs are suitably spaced, ensuring stability without appearing undersized or misaligned. The craftsmanship of the legs and decorative components adheres to the vintage design, suggesting they are well-conceived and structurally sound, fitting the overall aesthetic.",
