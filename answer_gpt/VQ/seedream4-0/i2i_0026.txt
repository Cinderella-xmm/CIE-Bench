    "Question": "Q1: Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the line art demonstrates consistent and natural body proportions and movements throughout the four frames. The stance and posture seem designed with an understanding of physical dynamics, reflecting realistic tennis movements. This consistency across frames provides a coherent representation of tennis action, as each frame transitions smoothly to the next, retaining logical proportions and positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket and ball are depicted in a minimalist line art style, which inherently lacks the detailed textures and details seen in realistic depictions. However, this style serves its purpose for clear and effective communication of the objects, although they do not retain the realistic textures found in more detailed imagery. This abstraction doesn't introduce artifacts, but it does mean loss of fine detail compared to a photograph.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, each hand position on the racket is drawn to reflect standard tennis grips used during play. The hand positions appear reasonable for capturing different phases of a tennis stroke, maintaining an ergonomic and realistic portrayal, complementing the depicted action sequences. There is no distortion suggesting improper grip; each frame represents proper handling technique for a tennis player.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a simplified monochrome backdrop which effectively focuses attention on the tennis player and their equipment, enhancing visual clarity by minimizing distractions. While fine details are not present due to the inherently simple line art style, the clarity and emphasis on movement and equipment are preserved without any observable distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the sequence of actions from preparation to follow-through in the clean line art style visually coherent and believable?",
    "explanation": "The sequence depicted in Image B clearly illustrates a coherent and believable progression from preparation to follow-through. Each frame builds logically on the previous, capturing an authentic sequence of actions typical in tennis. The use of clean line art aids in emphasizing continuity and fluidity, ensuring that the depicted movements remain understandable and believable.",
    "answer": "Yes"
