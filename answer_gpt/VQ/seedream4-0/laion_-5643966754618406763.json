      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tread patterns of the tires have been creatively transformed into armored segments that cover the back of a robotic armadillo-like creature. The detailed observation of Image B shows an even distribution of these patterns, which mimic the tread design while not showing any signs of repetitive or low-detail textures. The artistic reinterpretation effectively maintains the visual integrity of the tiresâ€™ tread, aligning with the theme of mechanical armor.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic joints appear to be meticulously integrated within the wheel openings, aligning well with the rim shapes. The connection looks structurally sound, with no visible gaps or physical inconsistencies. This suggests that the mechanical parts, including the suspension and joints, have been carefully designed to fit the dimensions and details of the original tire rims.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, the glowing eyes of the creature appear to be centered within their respective mechanical placements rather than wheel hubs. The light emission from these eyes is consistent and contained, without displaying halo effects or pixelation. There's also no excessive brightness that detracts from the overall image or causes an unnatural spill on nearby surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the antennae are not attached to the tire stack, but rather, they emerge from the head of the depicted creature. The antennae feature smooth, continuous geometry with proper attachment points, demonstrating no signs of floating or disjointed segments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image depicts a cohesive transformation of the tires into a singular robotic creature form, resembling an armadillo. There is a harmonious integration of all parts, with each tire serving a specific function (as legs) without any indication of missing, duplicated, or improperly scaled components. The result is a balanced and imaginative reinterpretation of the original items into a mechanical entity.",
