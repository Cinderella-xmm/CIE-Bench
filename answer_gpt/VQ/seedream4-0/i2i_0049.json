      "question": "Has the removal of the second zebra and grassland resulted in a clean transition without visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there doesn't appear to be any zebra or grassland to analyze for potential removal. Image B features a skier starting a race at a 'START' line. Because the context shows a snowy landscape, there are no signs of artifacts or unnatural edges related to grassland or zebra removal, ensuring the image is visually consistent and free of discrepancies. The answer needs to be based on the visible elements, which do not imply editing at the regions mentioned in the question.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the green gradient plane replacing the grass blend seamlessly with the zebra and ground, maintaining natural gradients and avoiding sharp contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we do not notice any green gradient or grass replacement. The image depicts a snowy environment with an individual on ski tracks. There are no green areas or zebras present; hence, there is no contrast or blending issue to evaluate. The scenery maintains a consistent look with its snowy background.",

      "question": "Is the zebra on the left intact and proportionally correct, with no signs of distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain any zebra to assess. Instead, we have the start of a ski race scene. Therefore, questions regarding distortion or proportionality flaws cannot be applied. All visible objects, including the skier and equipment, appear intact and proportionally accurate according to natural human and environmental shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the zebra's stripes and the ground's texture well-preserved, ensuring high-quality representation without loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no zebra present in Image B. The primary focus is on a skier and snowy terrain. The textures observed involve the snow and ski equipment, which appear to retain high quality with clear details like shadows and snow reflections, indicating a faithful representation of natural elements.",

      "question": "Does the final composition effectively convey a calm and solitary atmosphere without any elements disrupting the visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a singular skier at the start of a race, set against a quiet, snowy backdrop with sparse trees in the distance. This setting suggests a calm atmosphere, with minimal elements present to disrupt the scene's harmony. The absence of other racers or spectators adds to the solitary feeling.",
