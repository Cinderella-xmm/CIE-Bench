    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a drone with sophisticated design elements, including facial features that fit coherently with its angular aesthetic. The features harmonize with the crisp lines of the drone without any apparent texture artifacts or distortions. The facial detail integrates well with the overall design, which suggests careful editing to maintain a clean appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the rotor blade arms are well-proportioned and connected smoothly to the main body, maintaining functionality without showing distortion. This precise connection is crucial for a drone's aerodynamic efficiency, suggesting skillful editing that avoids any noticeable warping or structural irregularities.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spider-like legs appear to originate from logical positions where the landing gear would be, showing an understanding of structural positioning. The joints of these legs are continuous and intact, without any visible anomalies such as gaps or floating segments, indicating a meticulous and deliberate design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the drone illuminated in a manner consistent with the futuristic environment around it. The lighting effects on the drone and its reflections are well-tuned to match the chrome and glow of the cityscape, avoiding harsh lighting transitions and ensuring visual harmony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B is strategically placed near the face of the drone, featuring clear text that remains distinct from the surrounding mechanical and background elements. This thoughtful placement ensures readability and avoids any overlap, maintaining the integrity of the composition.",
