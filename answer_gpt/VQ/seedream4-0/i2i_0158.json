      "question": "Do the transitions between the front, left side, and rear views of the car appear smooth and free of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each view of the car (front, left side, rear) is presented independently, as opposed to the integrated view in Image A. By analyzing Image B, the transitions between these specific views do not exhibit any signs of visual anomalies, such as mismatched elements or abrupt changes in design features. Each view is developed to capture a natural aspect of the car from different angles, designed as separate entities without attempting to combine them into a singular composite view, thereby preventing potential transition artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the car parts consistent and logical across the three views without showing any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, each view (front, left side, rear) of the car maintains consistent proportions and logical angles, reflecting a harmonious design that is typical for such views. Common sense and knowledge about car design suggest that discrepancies would be evident if angles or proportions were inconsistent. In this case, each view maintains the expected symmetry and scale, reflecting correct proportions and angles, similar to those seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car's surface texture and material properties, like reflections and shine, appear uniform and realistic across all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is uniformity in the depiction of the car's surface texture, with consistent reflections and shine visible across all three views. The material properties of the car surfaces appear realistic, creating a uniform appearance that indicates high-quality renderings and consideration for real-world dynamics of light interaction with surfaces. This understanding aligns with common expectations of car materials and is verified by the presence of consistent visual cues present across all perspectives.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow effects consistent and correctly aligned across all three views of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the lighting and shadow effects are systematically applied across the front, side, and rear view of the car, indicating a consistent directional light source. Shadows fall predictably, matching the orientation and dynamics seen in each view, suggesting they have been rendered correctly and aligned logically based on an understanding of physics and lighting in car photography.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the background seamlessly integrate with the car without introducing any jarring inconsistencies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a minimal background that primarily consists of a white backdrop, designed to prevent any clash or distraction from the focus on the car. This choice removes potential artifacts or inconsistencies that could occur with a more complex background integration, as seen in Image A. The uniformity of the white background does not introduce incongruous visual elements, ensuring seamless integration with the car.",
