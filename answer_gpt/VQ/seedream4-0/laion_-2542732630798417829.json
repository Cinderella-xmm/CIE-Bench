      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile are depicted on the surface of the glass bulb. The smile and eyes are positioned on the outer glass and do not obscure the internal filament, allowing the viewer to see both the facial features and the filament structure clearly. This indicates that the facial features are drawn in a manner that maintains the transparency of the glass and visibility of the filament inside. Therefore, the eyes and smile are well integrated without causing distortion or blocking.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms extend from the sides of the bulb, each following the curvature of the bulb's shape. The lines from which they emerge are consistent and smooth, reflecting the natural outline of the bulb and cage. There is no visible disruption or jagged appearances, ensuring that the arms appear attached and congruent with the bulb's shape, preserving geometric coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metal cage surrounds the bulb with loops that are evenly spaced and symmetrical. The integrity of the cage is maintained, with all loops properly connected as they encircle the bulb, ensuring a uniform appearance without any section appearing to be missing or distorted. The symmetry and continuity of the cage indicate it is intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements in Image B interact with the bulb's light source, casting shadows and reflecting light in a manner aligned with the bulb's glow. The bulb's light illuminates the surrounding area, affecting surfaces and objects by casting shadows consistent with the directionality and brightness of the bulb. This realistic light interaction suggests accurate reflection and shadow casting in the background scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors across the glass, metal cage, and background are presented in a uniform manner, without visible stripes or color bands that would indicate uneven application. The tones are consistent and appropriate to their respective surfaces, avoiding oversaturation or any noticeable degradation in texture. This balanced application results in a visually harmonious image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text box and speech bubble are strategically placed away from the bulb's filament and metal cage, ensuring that they do not obfuscate critical parts of the bulb's structure. The positioning allows the text to be clearly visible and readable, avoiding overlap with significant visual components of the bulb's design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms in Image B extend from the bulb, positioned at natural angles that emulate the typical range of motion for limbs. They are placed without intersecting the glass or metal parts of the bulb in awkward or impossible configurations, maintaining coherence with the natural joint angles expected in animated or stylized representations. The arms follow a logical pattern of attachment and movement.",
