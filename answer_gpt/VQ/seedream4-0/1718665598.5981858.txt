    "Question": "Q1: Are the road sections composed of clearly defined angular shapes that align logically with the perspective and curvature of the original road, without floating or misaligned fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the road sections are composed of angular shapes, mainly triangles and quadrilaterals, that are aligned in a way that reflects the perspective of the original road. The shapes follow the road's curvature and maintain a coherent flow, with the yellow central lines extending logically. There are no floating or misaligned fragments observed, which indicates the editor has considered the perspective and alignment in this stylized representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the cloud formations consist of layered quadrilateral shapes that overlap in a way consistent with atmospheric depth, without abrupt edges or disconnected blocks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds are depicted using angular, layered shapes that are perhaps more stylistic than realistic. However, they maintain a sense of overlapping layers that suggest atmospheric depth, similar to how clouds might overlap in a natural setting. There are no abrupt edges that break the flow or disconnected blocks that would disrupt the continuity of the cloud mass.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the telegraph poles rendered as angular or geometric structures that maintain vertical alignment and proportional relationships between the pole and crossbars, without visible warping or structural collapse?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the telegraph poles are represented by straight, angular lines consistent with geometric design. These poles maintain their vertical alignment, and the proportional relationship with the crossbars is consistent. There is no visible warping or collapse, which suggests a deliberate effort was made to retain the structural integrity in the stylized format.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the tree canopies represented as solid triangular or pyramid-like shapes that sit naturally on the ground and do not float above the terrain or intersect with the road guardrails?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tree canopies are depicted as solid triangular shapes, giving them a simplified, geometric appearance. These shapes are positioned appropriately on the ground, neither floating nor intersecting with the road or its guardrails. This indicates that the design was executed with a focus on maintaining natural placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors across the road surface, sky, and surrounding vegetation uniformly distributed within the specified muted palette, without isolated bright spots, color bleeding, or textural noise?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used across the road surface, sky, and vegetation are part of a muted color palette, predominantly featuring greens and yellows with some neutral tones. This palette is uniformly applied across the entire image. There are no isolated bright spots that stand out or disrupt the cohesion, and the use of colors is consistent enough to avoid any noticeable color bleeding or textural noise.",
    "answer": "Yes"
