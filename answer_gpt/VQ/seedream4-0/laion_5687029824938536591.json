      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe clearly defined and aligned correctly, without warped edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the triangular overlay shapes are crisp and distinctly defined, maintaining their original alignment and position on the side of the shoe. There are no visible deformations or segments missing. This reflects the shoe's intended design, albeit with a wooden texture, ensuring that the overlay remains recognizable and intact. Hence, the structural integrity of these specific design elements has been preserved in the wooden rendition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wood grain lines flow naturally across the shoe's surface, following the contours of the panels and laces, without repeating or pixelated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wood grain lines on Image B appear to flow smoothly and naturally across the entire surface of the shoe. They elegantly follow the contours and shapes of the shoe's panels and laces, providing a realistic wooden texture. The grain patterns are consistent and devoid of any obvious repetition or pixelation, contributing to the seamless and authentic look of a carved wooden shoe.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the laces depicted as solid wooden strands with consistent width and proper threading through the eyelets, maintaining their original path and tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laces are depicted as wooden strands, each with a consistent width that mimics the appearance of traditional shoe laces. They are threaded appropriately through the eyelets, maintaining the original path and tension, creating a realistic transformation of shoe laces into wooden form. This consistency in design suggests a careful recreation in wood while preserving the shoe's original lace design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the darker and lighter wood tones create a clear distinction between the shoe's main body and highlights, such as the toe cap and midsole, without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shoe in Image B exhibits a range of wood tones that artfully distinguish the main body from highlights like the toe cap and midsole. These variance in tones are natural-looking, enhancing the sculpture's depth and form without any abrupt or unnatural color shifts, thus contributing to a visually appealing representation of the shoe in wood.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brand names and logos (e.g., \"Salomon\", \"Speedcross\", \"Contagrip\") clearly readable and accurately positioned on the shoe, with clean edges and no blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand names and logos on Image B remain clearly readable and are accurately positioned, similar to their appearance on a manufactured shoe. The edges of these texts are clean, without any signs of blurring or distortion. This level of detail preservation ensures that even in a wooden transformation, the branding elements remain prominent and clearly discernible.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the outsole feature deep, well-defined treads and a reinforced toe cap, with consistent depth and spacing that matches the original shoeâ€™s geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outsole of the shoe in Image B is crafted with deep and well-defined treads, which are consistent in depth and spacing, faithfully resembling the original shoe's geometry. The toe cap also appears reinforced, indicating that the treads were intricately carved to replicate the functional aesthetics of a shoe designed for traction.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden shoe placed on a clean, flat shelf with soft shadows beneath it, suggesting a stable and realistic display environment without floating or misaligned positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shoe is displayed on a clean, flat shelf. The presence of soft shadows beneath the shoe suggests a stable and grounded placement, emphasizing a realistic presentation. This shadows' orientation and diffusion make the shoe appear naturally placed, avoiding any floating or misalignment concerns, thereby enhancing its display quality.",
