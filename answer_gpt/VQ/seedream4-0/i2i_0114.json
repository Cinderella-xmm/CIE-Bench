      "question": "Does the modern man raising a glass appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the structural coherence of the original table arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man dressed in formal attire is standing beside the table in 'The Last Supper,' which is notably inconsistent with the setting. The original painting depicts seated figures participating in a shared meal, creating a coherent table arrangement. His presence introduces a disruption to the linear arrangement of the table, creating a visual inconsistency with the structure of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts visible around the modern man in formal attire that disrupt the natural appearance of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man's figure shows clear differences in texture and color compared to the rest of the painting. The original parts of the painting have a textured, old-master look with subtle color variations, while the modern man's attire appears flatter and more vibrant, which can create a noticeable discontinuity along the edges where he is integrated into the painting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the modern man in formal attire blend seamlessly with the artistic style of the original painting, maintaining consistent line work and shading without introducing visually incongruous elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artistic style of the original 'Last Supper' features detailed and delicate brushwork consistent with Renaissance art. In Image B, the modern man’s attire and vibrant styling starkly contrast with the softer, muted tones and detailed textures of the original painting, disrupting artistic consistency.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the addition of the modern man caused any distortion or damage to the geometric shapes of the table or surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the modern man in Image B does not seem to physically alter the geometric shapes and structure of the table or surrounding characters that are present in the original painting. The primary disruption is to aesthetic consistency rather than actual geometric distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the posture and action of the modern man, specifically him raising a glass, visually credible and consistent with the actions of others depicted in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the modern man is raising a glass, which is inconsistent with the actions depicted in 'The Last Supper,' where figures are engaged in a solemn historical moment without such gestures. His action introduces an element that is thematically and visually incongruent with the other figures’ poses and interactions.",
