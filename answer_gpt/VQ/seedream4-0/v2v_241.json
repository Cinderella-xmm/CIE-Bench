      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant maintain their current pose without any unnatural distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style models display exaggerated features typical of this style, such as rounded shapes and simplified anatomy. The horse stands on the elephant without visible distortions in their forms—such as bent limbs, unnatural stretching, or concavity—that would indicate deformation. Chibi design naturally emphasizes playful and cute characteristics rather than realistic proportions, thus conforming to expectations without resulting in incompatibility within their context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the photorealistic background of the grassy field and sky free from any artifacts or distortions introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a grassy field and sky background that appears to be consistent and without signs of editing artifacts such as unexpected color patches, pixelation, or distortion in clouds. The edited elements—the horse and elephant models—are distinct from the background, but no editing impacts are observable in the environmental features themselves.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the ornate photo frame blend naturally with the scene without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate photo frame outlines the scene of the chibi models against the photorealistic backdrop. The frame, while being a separate design element, does not visually disrupt the coherence of the scene nor introduces unnatural textures when considered alongside its surroundings. The frame's detail aligns with typical decorative object designs, not interfering with the background’s realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style 3D models of the horse and elephant preserved, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style models in Image B inherently emphasize exaggerated and simplified anatomy for an aesthetic effect. Within this context, both horse and elephant maintain coherent proportions relative to their style — rounded and symmetric, with neither appearing excessively altered in scale nor showing geometric distortions such as fragmented shapes. The models match the consistency expected from chibi designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D models retain fine details without any loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style models in Image B exhibit minimal surface detail due to the stylistic choice of simplification and smoothness, typical of such designs. While fine details like realistic textures are unnecessary for chibi designs, unnatural textures—like distorted surface patterns—are absent, maintaining the clarity of the aesthetic choices without introducing inconsistencies.",
