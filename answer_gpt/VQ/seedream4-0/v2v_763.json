      "question": "Does the transition between the realistic baseball field and the chibi-themed environment appear smooth without any noticeable breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing portal creates a clear boundary between the realistic baseball field and the chibi-themed environment. The transition is visually smooth, as the use of color and lighting effects create a seamless blend between the two worlds without any abrupt breaks or distortions. The portal acts as a cohesive element that connects the different visual styles, enhancing the smoothness of the transition.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the baseball player's uniform preserved naturally in the chibi-style depiction without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In a chibi-style illustration, certain details and textures are often simplified or exaggerated to fit the artistic style. Image B depicts the baseball player's uniform in a stylized, chibi manner, which inherently involves a departure from realistic detailing. Consequently, the finer textures and details of the uniform are not preserved naturally but are adapted to the chibi aesthetic, resulting in a simplified and cartoonish representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's body parts, such as arms and legs, remain consistent and credible in the chibi-style depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi style is characterized by exaggerated features, such as oversized heads and smaller bodies, which impacts the proportions and physical rationality of characters. In Image B, which showcases the player in a chibi style, the proportions are intentionally altered. The arms and legs appear short compared to the oversized head, disrupting the natural proportions seen in realistic depictions. This results in a playful yet unrealistic representation.",

      "question": "Does the glowing portal integrate naturally with the surrounding environment without introducing any unnatural artifacts or disrupting the overall visual appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing portal in Image B features vibrant colors and dynamic lighting effects that complement the grassy field, appearing as a natural and intentional addition to the scene. The portal smoothly bridges the realistic environment and the chibi world, without visible artifacts or disruptions. The use of lighting effects enhances its integration with the environment, maintaining the overall visual harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the viewer's hand being drawn into the chibi baseball realm look authentic and plausible without any unnatural distortions or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the viewer's hand reaching for the portal is depicted with realistic proportions, textures, and lighting, which contrast with the chibi world but maintain authenticity in the context of the hand's appearance. The interaction between the hand and the portal is visually coherent, without distorted perspectives or inconsistencies, lending the scene a sense of plausibility.",
