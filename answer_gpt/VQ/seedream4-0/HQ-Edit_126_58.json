    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the swan have been transformed into additional decorative features on the bottle, maintaining the look of frosted glass that harmonizes with the rest of the bottle. The visual cues suggest a uniform texture and translucency consistent with the original ice sculpture. There is no apparent seam or distortion visible, pointing to a seamless integration into the design, similar to how ice sculptures may appear pure and intact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck has been transformed into a glass stopper at the top of the swan-bottle. This design transition maintains the proportional shape and alignment with the body, displaying a smooth and rounded top typical for stoppers. The design does not feature any unnatural bending, jagged edges, or misaligned proportions, ensuring consistency with the original object's silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative elements in Image B, including pine branches and flowers, are thoughtfully arranged at the base of the bottle, appearing naturally anchored with the snowy platform, similar to traditional holiday decorations. The visual quality displays clear color definition and texture fidelity without signs of digital distortion such as blurring or pixelation. They appear well integrated, maintaining the harmony of the winter scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"Winter Glow\" text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Winter Glow' text is clearly visible on the bottle's surface. The alignment respects the curvature of the bottle, allowing for an undistorted view. The iridescent effect of the swan logo on the bottle appears consistent and smooth, without color fringes or digital artifacts, echoing the elegance expected from high-quality graphic designs.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the swan into a thematic perfume bottle while maintaining comprehensive structural coherence. The redesigned bottle preserves proportional alignment across its new features, including wings and neck-to-stopper transition, thereby avoiding any visual warping, stretching, or disjointed elements that could compromise the integrity and continuity of the elegant form.",
