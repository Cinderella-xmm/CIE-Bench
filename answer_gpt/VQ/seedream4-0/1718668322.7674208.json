      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the shoulder and chest armors visually exhibit a realistic metallic sheen. This is evidenced by the consistent reflection and shadowing visible on the armor, which suggests a depth appropriate for metallic surfaces. The light reflections appear natural rather than overly shiny or flat, which indicates a high level of surface detailing and accuracy matching real-world metallic objects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the joint areas of the armor following the natural contours of the anatomy, such as the elbows and knees. The joints look consistent with human anatomy, without signs of distortion or gaps that might render the armor impractical. This suggests a meticulous editing process where anatomical alignment was carefully considered.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the metallic hair strands flow smoothly and continuously. The color gradient transitions from blue to yellow are consistent and complementary, retaining their reflective properties throughout without any visible breaks or unnatural clumping. This indicates well-executed integration of metallic elements with aesthetic considerations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a background that presents a uniform gray tone, which matches typical studio settings designed for clarity and neutrality. No remnants of the original setting or inconsistencies in lighting are apparent, suggesting a thorough editing effort to ensure a seamless backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image reveals a high level of integration among its elements, with transitions between the armor and hair exuding smoothness. The consistent color tones and absence of mismatched edges or visible pixelation artifacts further indicate that the image has been carefully edited, maintaining harmony across all parts.",
