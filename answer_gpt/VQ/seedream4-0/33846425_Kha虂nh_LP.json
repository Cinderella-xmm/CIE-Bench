        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skirt has been enhanced to a more distinct and prominent lace pattern at the bottom. Observing the lace texture and pattern, it displays a consistent design without noticeable warping, tiling, or stretching. The lace appears to flow naturally with the skirt's overall shape, maintaining its integrity.",
