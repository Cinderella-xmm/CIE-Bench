      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure maintain a natural and coherent body structure without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure, as seen from the image, is characterized by its cartoonish proportions, which include a larger head relative to the body. This is typical in chibi-style art. In the edited image, the figure is standing upright without any visible distortions in limb or body structure, maintaining the expected proportions for such a design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi figures often exhibit large, expressive eyes and simple, cheerful expressions as key features of their design.
