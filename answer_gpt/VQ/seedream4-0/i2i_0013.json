      "question": "Does the subject maintain a recognizable likeness to the original person despite being transformed into an enamel pin style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the enamel pin design simplifies complex facial features, focusing on exaggerated key elements like the white hair and mustache, which are iconic characteristics of Albert Einstein. The pin accurately portrays these important identifiers, allowing viewers to recognize the character despite the stylized transformation. World knowledge helps identify these elements as distinctive features associated with Einstein.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image depicts an enamel pin where the shiny gold outlines are consistently smooth and clean, typical of well-manufactured pins which are designed to have polished edges. This detail is crucial for a visually appealing pin, enhancing the design’s aesthetic without distractions from pixelation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the subject retain its proper proportions and geometric shapes, avoiding any distortion or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image follows a stylized caricature design, common in enamel pins, which intentionally uses slightly exaggerated proportions like larger eyes and simplified shapes for expressive purposes. However, these artistic decisions are balanced, ensuring the overall construction does not appear distorted beyond this cartoonish style. The proportions are consistent within the context of the pin’s aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the subject's facial hair and hairline been preserved accurately in the enamel pin rendition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the enamel pin simplifies the details for manufacturing practicality, it effectively maintains the unique white hair and mustache that characterize the original subject, albeit in a less detailed and more abstract style. Fine details such as individual strands are not intricately preserved due to the nature of pin designs, but key elements are represented well enough to be recognizable.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays a neat, uniform white background typical for product images focusing on an object like an enamel pin. This choice enhances the visibility of the pin itself without any distraction from extraneous artifacts, ensuring clarity in presentation.",
