      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation of the dog is constructed using LEGO bricks and retains the recognizable features of a dog, such as its pose and facial expression. The structure appears well-constructed, with consistent brick patterns, indicating credibility in design without any distortions or artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gradient shading used for the sky and clouds preserve their natural appearance and depth without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky and clouds in Image B display a soft gradient that mimics natural sky conditions. This gradient appears smooth, and the clouds have realistic textures, ensuring depth and credibility without unnatural artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stop sign is constructed using LEGO bricks and is visually consistent with a real stop sign. The sign maintains its octagonal shape correctly, with proportional letters, confirming its physical rationality without distortions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the base and nameplate free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base and nameplate of the display in Image B appear smooth and polished, similar to real-world materials. The text on the nameplate is clear and well-integrated into the design, ensuring natural appearance and credibility without artifacts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosure preserve its authenticity and natural appearance, without introducing any visual distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube enclosure in Image B is depicted transparently and smoothly, resembling real glass. It shows reflections and clarity expected from a glass enclosure, maintaining authenticity without visual distortions or artifacts.",
