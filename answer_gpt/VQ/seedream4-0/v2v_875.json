      "question": "Are the edges of the palm tree and cactus seamlessly integrated into the Polaroid frame without visible artifacts or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree is positioned behind the Polaroid frame, and its edges are clean and well-defined, suggesting a seamless integration. Similarly, the edge of the cactus inside the frame appears smoothly integrated without any visible artifacts or unnatural breaks. This indicates that the editing connecting the frame with the background palm tree and cactus is executed seamlessly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style cactus maintain its original green color and texture, avoiding unnatural color shifts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style cactus in Image B presents a bright green color, which is typical for cacti, and it retains a consistent texture with well-defined details, such as spikes. There are no signs of unnatural color shifts or loss of detail, indicating it successfully maintains its original character despite being rendered in a 3D chibi style.",

      "question": "Does the human hand holding the Polaroid photograph appear anatomically correct with natural skin texture and no more than five fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the Polaroid frame shows a natural skin texture with an anatomically correct appearance. The hand visibly has just a thumb and index finger holding the frame, and while the other fingers are not explicitly visible, it does not appear to have more than five fingers, thus maintaining anatomical correctness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition where the 3D chibi-style cactus appears to break out of the Polaroid frame smooth and believable, without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style cactus appears to interact with the boundaries of the Polaroid frame by breaking out in a manner that looks smooth and believable. The transition does not display any distorted or broken geometric shapes, indicating a skillful integration of the 3D element with the 2D frame.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the palm tree, cactus, and the 3D chibi-style cactus align naturally with the light source in the image, avoiding any artificial highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows observable on the palm tree and cactus in Image B align well with the assumed light source, which appears to be coming from the top or slightly behind the viewer. The 3D chibi-style cactus also exhibits consistent lighting with appropriate highlights and shadows, showing no artificiality. This coherence suggests that the lighting across all elements in the image is handled naturally.",
