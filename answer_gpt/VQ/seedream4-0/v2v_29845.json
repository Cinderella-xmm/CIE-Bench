      "question": "Are the transitions between the man's clothing and the cow's fur smooth and free of unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the white coat and the cow's fur seems quite abrupt. The sleeves and hem of the coat end abruptly where the cow's fur begins, with no natural blending. The fur appears unnaturally positioned on the arms, which would typically not occur. This indicates a lack of a smooth transition between the clothing and fur, likely due to the editing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the combined figure, including the size of the horns relative to the body, appear physically plausible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the combination of the man's coat and the cow's body does not appear proportionally accurate. The horns are significantly large compared to the human component's body size, creating a disproportionate appearance. Given the dramatic size difference and inconsistent scale, the combined figure appears unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the details of the man's white coat and the cow's fur well-preserved and free from unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details of the white coat appear clear without any noticeable blurring or pixelation. Similarly, the cow's fur retains its natural detail, suggesting that the edit preserved these textures well. This implies that despite the combination, individual textures of the coat and the fur remain well-preserved.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the posture of the combined figure, including the positioning of the legs and head, appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the posture of the combined figure is awkward. The manâ€™s legs are natural for a human stance but appear fused with the cow's body, creating an unnatural stance overall. Moreover, the head with horns does not align with a typically human posture when combined with a cow body. This leads to an incongruous and unnatural posture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the combined figure within the scene, including its interaction with the grass and background, appear visually credible and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is placed on the grass in a way that is visually consistent with the setting, maintaining the natural perspective and shadowing between the figure and the background. Despite the unusual body combination, the figure's placement with respect to the grass and surrounding background does not appear distorted.",
