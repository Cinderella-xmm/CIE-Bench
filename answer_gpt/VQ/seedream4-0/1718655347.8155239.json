      "question": "Are the golden threads on the moon evenly distributed and seamlessly integrated into the circular shape without visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon appears as a circular embroidery with golden threads integrated into its form. The threads are arranged to enhance the circular shape without apparent breaks or distortions, showcasing meticulous design that maintains the integrity of a perfect circle. The uniformity in the distribution of the threads ensures that there are no interruptions or uneven sections, which helps preserve the seamlessness of the embroidery.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the interlocking geometric shapes on the mountain peaks align properly with the original ridge lines and maintain consistent scale and depth without floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents geometric shapes embroidered onto the mountain peaks. These shapes appear to be carefully aligned with the ridgelines, maintaining the coherence and flow seen in natural mountain formations. There are no noticeable segments that appear disconnected or floating, and the geometric patterns are consistent in scale, giving the embroidery a cohesive and orderly appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the embroidery patterns on the red trees aligned with their original positions and shapes, and do they display consistent thread density and direction without visible flaws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red trees have been embroidered in a way that matches their positions and general shapes as in a natural setting. The threads show a uniform density and direction that conveys a sense of movement and texture consistent with how tree foliage might appear in an embroidery format. There are no visible flaws such as gaps or inconsistent thread work, ensuring that the embroidery mimics a realistic visual.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the silvery-blue silk strands follow the natural curvature of the water body and show smooth transitions between sections without abrupt changes in thickness or direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embroidery representing the water body in Image B uses silvery-blue silk strands that fluidly follow the natural curvature of the river. The strands transition smoothly across different sections without abrupt changes in thickness or directional flow, which is crucial for maintaining the illusion of water movement and reflecting the natural dynamics seen in real water bodies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water all share a consistent artistic style and lighting response without creating visual dissonance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each element in Image B—moon, mountains, trees, and water—has been crafted in an embroidery style that adheres to a cohesive artistic vision. The use of similar threading techniques and color schemes across these elements ensures they respond harmoniously to light and share a unified aesthetic. This consistency prevents any visual dissonance and integrates the various components into a balanced and coordinated scene.",
