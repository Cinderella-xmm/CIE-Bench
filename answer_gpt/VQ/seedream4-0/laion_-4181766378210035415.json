    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base appear uniformly stacked, tightly interlocked, and aligned. The arrangement of bricks is consistent with the structure in a LEGO set, typically interlocking neatly without gaps. This demonstrates proper alignment, common in LEGO constructions where precision in fitting bricks is the norm.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the duvet consists of blue LEGO bricks, forming a consistent pattern without any floral design, which diverges from an intricate or irregular pattern expected from the original duvet's floral design. Instead, the smooth and consistent layout reflects uniformity in LEGO bedding rather than floral complexity. Hence, any comparison to floral patterns is irrelevant as LEGO bricks do not replicate the original detailed floral design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO headboard in Image B exhibits a curvature composed of individual LEGO elements that mimic a realistic LEGO arc. The construction illustrates a typical LEGO aesthetic, utilizing curves found in specialized LEGO pieces to facilitate gentle, realistic bends consistent with LEGO design ethos, without distortion or unnatural elongation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pillows in Image B are constructed with layers of LEGO bricks stacked to create a solid three-dimensional form, maintaining coherence and unity without floating or disconnected parts. This principle aligns with LEGO's interlocking nature, ensuring a stable and tangible appearance with proper layering that replicates pillow shapes.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows shadows cast by the LEGO bed aligning well with the directional lighting seen in Image A, maintaining consistency in shadow softening without any irregular or overly dark areas. The shadows correspond to the realistic lighting principles found in both LEGO and non-LEGO setups, showing natural illumination and shadow interplay.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates proportionality in the positioning and scaling of pillows, duvet, and headboard akin to the original bed dimensions found in Image A. From a design perspective in LEGO, proportions often replicate real-world dimensions accurately, maintaining fidelity in spatial arrangement and scale that echoes the original setup.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks possess a consistent matte texture typical of standard LEGO materials, devoid of glossiness, transparency, or pixelation. These elements reflect high-quality rendering, adhering to LEGO's design characteristics, where uniformity in material appearance is a standard.",
