      "question": "Does the dark velvet robe show realistic fabric folds and light reflection consistent with thick, heavy material, and do the golden embroidery patterns follow natural thread-like textures without pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe appears to have realistic fabric folds and the light reflection suggests a thick, heavy material, which is typical for velvet. The golden embroidery patterns are detailed and display natural thread-like textures without noticeable pixelation or jagged edges. These elements are indicative of high-quality, realistic editing.",

      "question": "Are the wooden shelves aligned with the original bookcase structure in terms of depth and angle, and do the books display consistent spine thickness, aging effects, and shadows that match the overall lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shelves appear well-aligned, reflecting a consistent structure with appropriate depth and angle typical of a bookcase. The books show consistent spine thickness, visible aging effects, and shadows that correlate with the lighting conditions in the room, contributing to a coherent and plausible scene.",

      "question": "Do the fingers wrap naturally around the quill and parchment without extra digits, unnatural bending, or gaps between skin and object, and is the parchment folded in a way that matches real paper flexibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The depiction of the fingers in Image B shows them wrapping naturally around the quill and parchment, with no extra digits or unnatural bending observed. There are no visible gaps between the skin and objects. The parchment appears to be folded realistically, consistent with the flexibility of real paper, which enhances the natural look of the image.",

      "question": "Is the inkstand positioned flush with the armrest surface, casting a soft shadow consistent with the light source, and does it have reflective metallic properties that match the surrounding environment without appearing flat or artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inkstand in Image B is positioned flush with the armrest, and it casts a soft shadow that aligns with the apparent light source, supporting the realism of the scene. The inkstand also exhibits reflective metallic properties, blending well with the environment and avoiding a flat or artificial appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the warm light source create soft gradients on the face, highlight the golden embroidery, and produce gentle shadows beneath the chin and arms, with no abrupt transitions or mismatched brightness levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warm light source in Image B creates soft gradients observable on the clothing, while the golden embroidery is effectively highlighted, enhancing its intricate design. Gentle shadows are noticed beneath the arms, contributing to a seamless transition with no abrupt changes or brightness mismatches, supporting the cohesive lighting of the scene.",
