        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the visual style is highly stylized, intended details are notably clear in the sunflower centers and hair as part of the design's intention. However, this intentionally abstract approach may not aim for realistic detail reproduction, focusing instead on stylization and artistic expression. Despite this, the stylization is executed without noticeable blurring or artifacting.",
