      "question": "Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the glass candle chamber shows consistent transparency and refractivity, akin to natural glass, with light clearly passing through and being refracted in a realistic manner. The embossed gold floral motifs are sharply defined without distortion, with natural shadows and highlights enhancing their clarity, exhibiting no signs of unnatural texture or artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the camel red hue of the glass candle chamber evenly distributed and visually harmonious with the surrounding silver and gold elements, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural saturation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camel red hue is evenly distributed across the glass candle chamber, providing a visually harmonious contrast with the surrounding decorative elements in silver and gold. The seamless transition of colors and the lack of abrupt shifts or excessive saturation confirm that the color is natural and well-integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the wooden lid accurately reflect the contour and curvature of the original teapot handle, and does it display natural wood grain and polish without visible artifacts or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden lid in Image B maintains a natural wood grain and polish, displaying subtle variances in color and texture typical of polished wood. The curves and contours match those of the teapot's handle, indicating accurate design replication, and there are no visible geometric distortions or artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned on the base in a way that aligns with the existing decorative elements, and does it lack jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast that would suggest digital insertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand logo on the base in Image B is well-aligned with the teapot's decorative elements. It is smoothly integrated with no jagged edges or any signs of pixelation. The contrast and color match seamlessly with the base's existing color scheme, indicating no apparent issues that suggest digital insertion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the newly added patterned fabric background exhibit consistent texture, proper lighting interaction, and seamless integration with the teapot's shadow and reflection on the surface below, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterned fabric background shows consistent texture and interacts well with the scenario's lighting, creating a natural environment with appropriate shadows and highlights. The shadows cast by objects, including the teapot, are realistically displayed, and reflections on the wooden surface are coherent, without visible seams or lighting inconsistencies.",
