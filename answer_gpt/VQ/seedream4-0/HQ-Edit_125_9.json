      "question": "Does the textured grain overlay appear uniformly distributed across the entire image without causing visible distortion or obscuring fine details such as the soccer ballâ€™s pentagons or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textured grain overlay gives a vintage feel and is applied uniformly across the image without significant distortion. The hexagonal and pentagonal patterns on the soccer ball remain clear and distinguishable. This uniform texture enhances the image without obscuring details, including the fabric lines on the player's uniform.",

      "question": "Are the enhanced reds in the jersey and socks vivid but still within natural color bounds, with no visible color bleeding into adjacent areas like skin or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reds in Image B are intensified, adding vibrancy to the jersey and socks. Despite the increase in saturation, these colors remain within natural bounds and do not bleed into adjacent areas, such as the skin tones or shadows on the field.",

      "question": "Are the houses and trees in the background reduced to simplified silhouettes without losing their basic structural form or introducing broken edges or floating shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements, such as houses and trees, maintain their structural form and do not turn into simplified silhouettes. The details are retained, keeping their realistic representation rather than appearing as abstract forms.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"Footy Legends\" placed across the bottom of the image in a way that does not block essential foreground elements like the soccer ball or the player's foot, and does it blend cohesively with the background without sharp edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Footy Legends' is strategically placed at the bottom of Image B, ensuring it does not interfere with or obscure critical elements such as the player's foot or the soccer ball. The text blends cohesively with the background, maintaining smooth edges and alignment.",
