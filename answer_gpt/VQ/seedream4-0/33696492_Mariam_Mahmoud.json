      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wing-shaped shelves formed from the original bookshelves smooth and continuous without jagged edges or missing segments, and do they feature leaf textures that blend naturally with the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original bookshelves have been transformed into wing shapes that visually resemble birds in flight. The wing-shaped structures appear to have smooth, continuous lines without jagged edges or missing segments. The textures are coherent with a leaf-like appearance, suggesting a natural blending with wood. This transformation indicates attention was paid to the continuity and visual cohesion of the shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hanging fungi occupy the same positions as the original lamps, have rounded caps and stems resembling real mushrooms, and display a soft glow without visible artifacts or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original lamps have been replaced by mushrooms with caps and stems typical of real fungi. The mushrooms are positioned in places likely similar to where the lamps were initially located. They emit a soft glow with no evident harshness or unnatural lighting, and the gradients appear smooth, indicative of well-executed lighting design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chair and stool replacements shaped like natural rocks with uneven surfaces and moss coverage that follows realistic growth patterns, and do they retain a size suitable for human seating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating arrangements are transformed into structures resembling natural rocks. They exhibit uneven surfaces with moss that appears to be growing naturally across them. Despite their rock-like appearance, these structures retain a size that indicates they are still functional as seating for humans.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the book-to-bird transformations show complete bird bodies with defined heads, wings, and tails, and do the feathers contain readable text fragments arranged in a natural pattern without distorted letters or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed birds in Image B have clearly defined full bodies with identifiable heads, wings, and tails. The feathers on these birds are part of the design transformation and are embellished with text. The text on the feathers is positioned in a way that appears natural, without noticeable distortions or irregular gaps. The text remains legible, suggesting a coherent transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the entwined branches forming the ceiling connected and interlaced in a natural way without gaps or floating segments, and do they cast shadow patterns that align with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling structure now consists of intertwined branches that consistently cover the area. These branches appear naturally interlaced without any floating or awkwardly disconnected segments. The shadows cast by the branches align with the directional light pattern seen in Image A, given the consistent shadow effects created by the sunlit scene.",
