      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear of the chibi-style skiers appear consistent with the original design and maintain their structural integrity without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style skiers wear outfits similar in color and style to the original image (Image A), featuring a red and blue jacket respectively paired with black pants. The backpacks and skiing gear, including poles and skis, are also consistent in design and care taken with details. Using common sense, the design of the chibi-style characters is expected to exaggerate certain features stylistically, making them appear consistent without unnatural distortions when assessing this type of character. In Image A, the outfit's material and appearance are realistic as expected in a natural human depiction while Image B stylizes these elements, ensuring the design intent of chibi characters is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the skiers' outfits, backpacks, and skiing gear preserved well, without any noticeable loss or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the outfits and gear in a chibi-animation style, smooth and cartoonish by nature, which does not typically hold high texture detail as seen in realistic depictions. The details have been adapted to fit the chibi style; hence the textures are intended to be minimal and simplistic rather than richly detailed, consistent with what is anticipated for such designs. In Image A, the realistic depiction includes more visible material texture and gear detail. Considering this styling, Image B holds enough detail to convey the necessary features of the clothing and gear without any unwanted artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snowy forest setting and the arrangement of environmental elements like trees and snow remain authentic and undistorted, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B the snowy forest setting is maintained; the arrangement of trees and the presence of snow cover appear consistent and naturally placed, depicting a peaceful winter scene without distortion. Image A similarly displays these elements in a realistic manner, ensuring the environment is portrayed authentically. Despite changes to the style for Image B, the environmental settings remain cohesive with typical atmospheric depiction expected in a winter, snow-covered forest setting, thus contributing to the sceneâ€™s authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style skiers' bodies relative to their surroundings physically rational and free from any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style characters in Image B are intentionally designed with exaggerated proportions like larger heads and rounded body features typical for this style, but fit well within the scene of a snowy path with correctly sized skiing gear that allows them to remain proportionate relative to the depicted environment. Image A's realistic proportions naturally align with a human's in this context, while Image B reflects standardized chibi proportions, maintaining geometric integrity without appearing distorted.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the skiers, the snowy path, and the surrounding forest, maintain visual credibility without any inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a coherent composition where the chibi-style skiers, the snow path, and the surrounding forest are arranged in a way that maintains visual credibility. The stylistic approach dictates certain exaggerated features but the layout and arrangement remain consistent. Compared to Image A, which portrays a realistic setup, Image B successfully applies its stylistic modifications maintaining an overall balanced scene without inconsistencies.",
