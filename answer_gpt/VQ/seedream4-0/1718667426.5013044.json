      "question": "Does the ogre's body have simplified yet coherent proportions with no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's body is designed as a cartoonish figure, which naturally simplifies and exaggerates certain features for stylistic effect. Despite this cartoonish style, the proportions are coherent with typical representations of animated characters, showing no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles. The limbs and joints are in positions that appear stable and balanced, consistent with common design principles for cartoon figures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the ogre’s body and clothing uniformly matte with no shiny reflections or residual skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ogre in Image B showcases a distinctly animated and stylized appearance, typical in cartoons where surfaces are made to appear uniformly matte for simplicity. The body's surface is smooth, with no shiny reflections that would typically indicate a polished or textured surface. Similarly, the clothing's appearance matches this style, further ensuring a matte aesthetic throughout the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the foam club visibly softer in edge definition, larger in scale, and held securely in the ogre’s right hand without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The club in Image B is depicted as a large, exaggerated cartoon weapon, aligning with the visual style of the figurine. It appears to have softer edges in its definition, resembling a foam-like material. The club is proportionally larger to emphasize its significance and is securely held in the ogre’s right hand without any visible deformation or awkward grip, consistent with cartoon character designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fur-trimmed cape attached at the shoulders, extending downward without clipping into the body or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the cape is clearly visible, attached at the ogre’s shoulders, and appears to extend downward in a natural flow. The cape retains its position and form without any visible clipping into the body, which would cause visual disruption, or appearing detached, ensuring it follows real-world physical behavior in a stylized manner.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the rocky base fully grounded, with the plaque clearly engraved and readable, and no floating or shadow inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocky base under the ogre is grounded, providing a stable foundation for the figure. The plaque is part of the design and is clearly engraved with the text 'Mighty Ogre,' readable without any distortion. There are no apparent floating elements or shadow inconsistencies that would suggest detachment from the ground, maintaining a coherent and integrated visual presentation.",
