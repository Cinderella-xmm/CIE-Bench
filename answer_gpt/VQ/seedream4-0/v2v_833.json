      "question": "Do the pancakes, berries, bread, and flower vase appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without disrupting the structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of the breakfast items such as the pancakes, berries, bread, and vase is positioned towards the front on the table. The visual style, as seen in this stylized design, is cartoonish and simplified, yet they coexist harmoniously within the space of the image. The blending of lines and colors ensures there is no inconsistency with the table setup and environment, achieving a cohesive scene.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the pancakes, berries, bread, and flower vase detailed and natural, without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the items are intentionally simplified due to its stylized, cartoon-like design. The pancakes, berries, bread, and vase feature smooth, clean textures without the complexities seen in realistic images, fitting the overall aesthetic of the image. Therefore, while deliberately selective and clean, they are devoid of distracting artifacts, retaining clarity consistent with the art style.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and shadow on the breakfast items and vase correspond naturally with the light source in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light appears to be entering from a window on the side, casting shadows and illuminating objects consistently. The shadows under the breakfast items and the vase correlate directly with this light source direction, and the shading on the coffee cup and girl's clothing matches this lighting approach, adhering to the room's atmosphere faithfully.",

      "question": "Are the sizes and placements of the pancakes, berries, bread, and flower vase proportionate and physically logical within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the size proportions of the breakfast items and vase are maintained logically. The pancakes are an appropriate size for a small breakfast, the bread and berries match expected sizes in relation to the other elements on the table, and the vase is neither too large nor too small; everything aligns cohesively with the coffee cup and overall table arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the subject's hand holding the coffee cup maintain a natural pose and grip, without any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's hands are depicted in a simplified, cartoonish form, gripping the coffee cup gently. Despite the abstract style, the pose is believable and consistent within the context of the image's artistic style. There's no visible distortion, providing a natural and cohesive continuation of the image's stylized narrative.",
