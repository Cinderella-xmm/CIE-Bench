      "question": "Does the fabric of the qipao display a uniform silk-like watercolor texture without visible seams, blocky patches, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the qipao as having a soft, watercolor-like texture typical of artistic illustrations. The fabric seems uniformly made with a smooth appearance, and there are no visible seams or blocky patches that would break this uniformity. The transition in colors appears soft and blended, indicative of the artistic style that aims for consistency and harmony in shading.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold foil accents on the floral patterns aligned with the flower shapes and do they show realistic reflection behavior based on the surrounding lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the gold foil accents follow the shape of the flowers accurately and appear properly integrated into the floral design. The accents do not reflect light in a naturalistic sense; rather, they contribute to an overall artistic embellishment. Art renderings typically prioritize decorative aesthetic over photorealistic lighting effects.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the floral border continuous and properly aligned along all four edges of the image without gaps, overlaps, or distorted elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral border in the lower section of Image B appears continuous and centered along all edges. The flowers and branches form a clean, consistent design without visible gaps or overlaps, maintaining symmetry and proportion, which reflects artisanal skill and attention to detail typical in decorative bordering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the branches forming the writing space correctly shaped, evenly spaced, and free from unnatural bends or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the lower section of Image B, the branches seem evenly spaced and artistically shaped to frame the writing space with a natural curvature. There are no visible inconsistencies such as unnatural bends or disconnected branches, aligning with typical handcrafted elegance seen in watercolor illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ivory paper texture visible in the background but does not interfere with the clarity or detail of the person or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an ivory-like texture in the lower section where it frames the writing space, without impeding the visibility and details of the qipao above. This separation of artistic elements ensures that the artistic focus remains on the clothing while the paper texture serves a complimentary background function without crossing into the image's top section.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands show five fingers each with natural joint angles and skin texture, and are they positioned in a way that matches human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B clearly display five fingers each, with what appears to be a realistic portrayal of joint angles reflective of natural positioning. The depiction of skin texture in an illustration may not be highly detailed as in a photo, but the anatomical structure aligns well with typical artistic rendering and captures the aged character presence.",
