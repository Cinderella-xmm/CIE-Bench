These swirls do not extend into the room, nor do they disrupt the alignment or structure of the window frame. This effective containment ensures that the artistic elements outside the window do not interfere with the interior scene.",

These inlays exhibit a consistent sheen that reflects light in a way characteristic of metallic surfaces, helping them appear naturally integrated into the violin without looking detached or misaligned.",

The text is legible and does not intersect with or cover key elements like the violinist, window, or any objects in the room. This careful placement ensures that the border complements rather than distracts from the central subjects of the image.",
