    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D model of the Aquatic warrior (edited image B) presents a human figure dressed in armor. Based on common anatomical knowledge, the limbs and body structure appear well-proportioned, resembling the standard human anatomy without distortions or exaggerations. The articulation of limbs and joints are consistent with natural human figures.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image B shows the armor with metallic blue surfaces which reflect light and have depth. These characteristics provide a realistic appearance as variations in lighting and texture are visible, which prevent the surfaces from appearing flat or uniformly colored.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the trident is held firmly by the warrior's right hand. It appears appropriately scaled relative to the figure, with no visible bending or truncation. The grip also seems natural, which confirms the correct positioning.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome in image B is a smooth, glass-like structure that encases the model. It appears to have consistent transparency, smooth curvature, and no visible stitching or warping. There are also no reflection anomalies that would disrupt the visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coral reef base in image B shows detailed textures and organic patterns that resemble natural coral formations. The scale of the base is also appropriate relative to the model, providing a supportive foundation without appearing disproportionate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The swirling ocean currents in image B flow smoothly around the model, presenting continuous, flowing patterns. There are no abrupt breaks or fragments visible, ensuring natural and cohesive motion in the representation of water.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the hand holding the trident shows five fingers grasping the trident naturally. The joint angles and grip pressure seem realistic for a human hand, without any unnatural bends or extra digits.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a spatially coherent composition where the model, dome, base, and swirling currents are aligned and layered correctly. Each element is connected seamlessly, with no parts appearing to float or become disconnected from the overall scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
