      "question": "Do the ceramic sculptures exhibit a uniform glossy finish with realistic reflections that align with the direction and intensity of the sunset light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic octopus sculpture in Image B has a glossy finish which is common for ceramic objects. These reflections mimic natural highlights one would expect under lighting conditions. However, the realism of these reflections in terms of matching a sunset light environment cannot be directly verified solely based on the provided image, as the light source is not shown. Nevertheless, assuming a typical ceramic gloss, it should reflect light uniformly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured scales evenly distributed across the sculpture surfaces without visible repetition, distortion, or sharp edges suggesting digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scales on the ceramic sculptures in Image B appear uniform and evenly distributed, without any indications of repetition, distortion, or jagged edges that would suggest digital manipulation. The clarity and consistency of the scales' pattern reflect a high-quality production typical of ceramic art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep oceanic blue coloration of the sculptures consistent across all parts and harmonious with the surrounding ocean and sky colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color of the ceramic sculpture in Image B is a rich, deep blue throughout. This is a consistent coloration typical of glazed ceramics. While Image A's ocean and sky colors are not directly applicable to Image B due to different scene settings, the blue is vivid but does not clash with sandy surrounding tones.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly sandy-colored with no visible traces of the original ocean, waves, or shoreline elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background showcases a sandy surface with no visible elements of ocean, waves, or shoreline that are prominent in Image A. This suggests a controlled environment typical of an art setting, such as a photography studio.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a continuous, flowing wave pattern that matches the curvature and rhythm of the original ocean waves in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of the ceramic octopus and its limbs in Image B does not show a linear or flowing wave pattern. The limbs are positioned in a manner typical of free-standing sculptures but do not replicate the flowing dynamic motion of ocean waves seen in Image A. The sculpture's limbs are stiff and arranged artfully rather than in a motion-representative pattern.",
