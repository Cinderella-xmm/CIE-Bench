    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass container display natural transparency with visible embossed patterns that do not appear distorted or unnaturally stretched?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot exhibits intricate patterns and embossing, potentially confused with transparency. However, a teapot is typically not transparent. The embossing looks consistent and natural without distortion. While one might question distortion due to reflection, these imperfections often come with such ornate designs and materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the candle snuffer finial proportionally aligned with the glass container and structurally connected without gaps or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the candle snuffer finial appears to be suspended above the teapot, suggesting a floating element. Normally, a finial would be connected directly to the teapot without any visible gaps, indicating a structural misalignment due to the visible floating element.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the marble base show consistent veining and reflective surface without any remnants of lace texture or unnatural seams?",
    "explanation": "The marble base in Image B is presented with a smooth, visibly consistent veining pattern typical of marble surfaces. The reflection off the marble base appears clear and natural, without any leftover lace texture or seam-like disruptions. This suggests an accurate portrayal of marble properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the nameplate attached to the side of the container at a natural height and angle, with no floating or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the nameplate ‘Elegance Aroma’ is fixed lower on the marble base, displaying a natural angle directly consistent with how nameplates would be affixed. There are no signs of floating or clipping artifacts indicating a realistic placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections and shadows on the glass container, marble base, and finial align with the direction of the light source and exhibit consistent material behavior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light source direction is marked from the top left corner. The reflections and shadows follow this directional light source consistently across the teapot's surface, marble base, and even the finial. This indicates physical behavior in accord with the expected interaction of light with reflective surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
