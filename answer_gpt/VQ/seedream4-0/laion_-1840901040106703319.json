      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure is composed of an intricate design of multi-faceted crystals forming a geometric shape. The facets do not directly replicate the triangular and rectangular outlines of a traditional cabin as seen in wooden or conventional constructions. Therefore, the alignment of the facets does not mirror traditional architecture but instead follows an artistic interpretation that is not uniform. This suggests that the crystal facets are not evenly shaped or aligned with the traditional outlines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal surfaces in Image B exhibit a range of hues that vary according to how light interacts with them. The transparency and light reflection properties suggest realistic crystal behavior, where light can pass through and be refracted or reflected differently across various facets. This effect is consistent with the characteristics of real glass or crystal, showing non-uniform, dynamic color impressions rather than static, solid colors.",

      "question": "Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original structural components such as vertical beams and horizontal railings have been replaced by a crystalline structure devoid of any resemblance to traditional beams or railings. The original spatial configuration and alignment typical of cabins are not evident. The conversion to a crystal form does not maintain the structural elements' original positioning. Therefore, they do not maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble platform in Image B appears pristine, showcasing an uninterrupted, flat surface extending uniformly across the base of the structure. There are no visible cracks or irregularities in this surface, and the continuous design suggests that the platform is both aesthetically and structurally consistent in its presentation. This reflects the adherence to the conditions described.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the structure in Image B, small crystal formations are visible and appear proportionally smaller than the main building. These formations are arranged in clusters, echoing patterns of natural crystal growth. Their deliberate organization around the base projects a purposeful design rather than arbitrary placement, suggestive of a naturalistic presentation.",
