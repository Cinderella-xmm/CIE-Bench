      "question": "Are the stitches on the cactus’s body and sombrero clearly visible, evenly spaced, and consistent with the knitting style of the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stitches on the cactus's body and sombrero appear consistent with a typical crochet knitting pattern, which consists of interlocking loops of yarn. This pattern usually features visible, evenly spaced stitches that are similar across knitted items. The cactus and sombrero in the image demonstrate this quality, meaning the stitches are clear, evenly distributed, and consistent with the overall knitting style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mane and striped pattern on the donkey display natural yarn-like texture and proper alignment without visible distortions or gaps between stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donkey’s mane features a frayed-ish yarn texture that is visually typical for a knitted plush. Furthermore, the striped body pattern is well-aligned and the colors do not run into each other, indicating good borders between the stripes. There aren't visible distortions or gaps indicating a consistent and proper texture as expected in high-quality knitted plush items.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the limbs and body proportions of both the cactus and donkey preserved in a way that reflects typical plush toy design without unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Focusing on Image B, the proportions of both plush toys appear consistent with typical plush toy designs. The cactus maintains a recognizably cartoonish form with well-balanced arms, head, and body positioning which is normal for these type plush representations. Similarly, the donkey possesses well-proportioned legs relative to its body without evident signs of stretching or shrinking. This indicates preservation of natural proportions in both toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned in a way that suggests it is part of the same scene, with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the plush toys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box is seamlessly part of the scene with the cactus and donkey. The shadows and lighting are consistent between the box and the toys, which suggests they are under the same lighting conditions. The angles at which shadows appear on the toys suggest a uniformly lit scene without discrepancies between the light incidence on the box compared to the plush toys.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, color bleeding, or double outlines at the boundaries between the cactus, pot, donkey, and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the borders between the cactus, pot, donkey, and the background appear smooth without any visible artifacts such as jagged edges or color bleeding. The outlines are consistent and clean, indicating a well-finished editing process without lingering issues that often appear in poorly rendered images.",
