      "question": "Do the stripes on the character's costume maintain their clarity and definition without unnatural blurring or distortion in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes on the character's costume appear clearly defined, maintaining a uniform pattern across the outfit. They do not seem blurred or distorted, fitting well within the claymation style, which typically has less smooth textures compared to realistic images. The claymation style often includes slight textural changes compared to photographic reality, but the stripes remain visually consistent and intact.",

      "question": "Does the beret retain its original shape and placement on the character's head without appearing unnaturally warped or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beret on the character's head maintains a consistent shape that corresponds with what is typically expected of a beret's appearance. Despite the claymation style, which simplifies and smoothens shapes, the beret's curves and placement on the head appear natural and not distorted or misplaced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fingers on the character's hand holding the phone naturally shaped and textured, without any unnatural distortions or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fingers holding the phone, while simplified in texture due to the claymation style, maintain a plausible shape and position natural for gripping a phone. The details like slight finger bending and the separation between each finger are clear enough to mimic human anatomy without appearing distorted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the European rooftops and buildings in the background retain their structural integrity and visual plausibility without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the European rooftops and buildings, despite being rendered in claymation style, maintain their structural shapes and proportions. While textures and fine details are more muted compared to a realistic photograph, the essential forms and outline of buildings are preserved, and they do not appear unnaturally distorted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character's pose, including the way they hold the phone, appear natural and consistent with human ergonomics in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's pose, including the arm bent with the hand holding a phone, looks consistent with how a human would naturally hold a phone to their ear. Despite the claymation style sometimes exaggerating poses, the character's stance and arm position appear ergonomically plausible and coherent with common human gestures.",
