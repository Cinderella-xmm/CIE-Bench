      "question": "Does the cat’s curled-up posture in the chibi illustration match the original position on the car hood and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi illustration (Image B), the cat is depicted in a curled-up position on the car hood. Considering common ways of cartoon-style representations, the posture captures the general idea of a cat curling up, which aligns with the posture observable in the original photo (Image A). Both images show the cat resting in a circular motion with its body curled inwards. By comparing the overall shape and positioning, despite the stylization, the structural consistency is preserved across both images.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gradient color blocks used to depict the cat’s fur smooth and free from unnatural textures or color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi illustration uses simplified gradients and color blocks to depict the cat's fur, characteristic of many illustrative styles. The colors are presented in smooth transitions and do not display any harsh lines or pixelation that would suggest unnatural textures. This approach aligns with common cartooning techniques for fur, providing a clean and aesthetically pleasing appearance.",

      "question": "Does the car appear as a curved surface with reflection lines only, maintaining its structural integrity and avoiding obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi illustration, the car is represented as a simplistic, curved surface with minimal reflection lines indicative of a glossy surface. This style is typical in cartoons where excessive detail is omitted to maintain a clean look. There are no visible artifacts such as jagged lines or unintended markings; the car's surface appears smooth and structurally integrated within the cartoon aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sticker outlined with a thick white line and does it have a transparent background, retaining the visual coherence of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image features a chibi-style sticker outlined with a prominent white border, a common stylistic choice for stickers to emphasize the design. The background appears transparent as typically implied by the checkerboard pattern seen here, allowing it to be applied over various surfaces without disrupting scene coherence. This consistent element aids in maintaining the visual coherence expected in sticker designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any unnatural textures been introduced, or have key details of the cat and car been lost in the chibi illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The chibi illustration intentionally simplifies details to achieve a stylized appearance. While the detailed textures of the fur and the car's surface are not present, this is a deliberate choice rather than a loss of key details. Such simplification is typical for cartoons and stickers and does not introduce unnatural textures which would contrast sharply with the art style's intent. The essential form and character of the original objects are retained.",
