      "question": "Do the chibi-style sheep retain proportional accuracy and structural coherence relative to their original poses near the fence in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the chibi-style sheep are represented with exaggerated features typical of chibi art, focusing on cuteness rather than realistic proportions. This style involves larger heads and simplified bodies, which results in a departure from the naturalistic proportions seen in image A. Although the positions and poses near the fence are somewhat consistent, the structural coherence is compromised due to the inherent art style differences.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added accessories (red scarf, knit hat, and small bell) free of unnatural textures and logically placed on the chibi sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The accessories on the chibi sheep in image B are designed in a cartoonish style that matches the overall aesthetic of chibi art. The red scarf, knit hat, and small bell are placed logically on the sheep, corresponding to where such accessories would normally be worn. The textures and cartoonish outlines are consistent with the flat, simple coloring typical of this art style, avoiding any unnatural appearances.",

      "question": "Do the thick white outlines and flat colors applied to the chibi sheep create a visually coherent and artifact-free appearance, maintaining their structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the chibi sheep are outlined with thick white lines and filled with flat colors. This approach aligns with the standard practices of chibi art, which focuses on simplicity and visual appeal. These design choices contribute to a coherent and clean appearance without visible artifacts or distortions that might compromise structural integrity.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the chibi sheep near the fence remain visually credible, preserving their original spatial relationship with the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylistic transformation of the sheep into chibi figures in image B, their overall positioning and spatial arrangement near the fence closely follow that of the original sheep in image A. This preserves the intended context and interaction with the surrounding environment, maintaining a credible visual relationship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background successfully made transparent without visible artifacts or remnants of the snowy landscape affecting the clean appearance of the chibi sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the background has been removed to create a transparent effect around the chibi sheep. This change is executed cleanly, as there are no visible remnants of the original snowy landscape or artifacts that might detract from the chibi figures' appearance. The sheep stand out crisply against the transparent background, ensuring a neat visual presentation.",
