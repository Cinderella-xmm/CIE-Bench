      "question": "Are the cutout windows on each tier aligned with the chocolate drops and have smooth, uninterrupted edges without jagged or fragmented borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B closely, it shows several tiers with cutout windows, designed to let one see through the structure with chocolate drops suspended in them. These windows appear to be symmetrically placed around the structure and have smooth, continuous edges without interruptions. The even spacing and clean edges contribute to a visually cohesive design, giving the impression of careful craftsmanship typical in high-quality chocolate presentations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the gold foiling applied across the surface show uniform reflectivity and smooth transitions without visible seams, pixelation, or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features gold foiling on certain elements, such as nuts and other decorative parts. The foiling appears to reflect light evenly, contributing to the overall luxurious feel of the presentation. There are no visible seams or pixelation, and the reflectivity appears consistent without overly bright or washed-out spots, indicative of well-applied gold foiling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the nut embellishments attached to the chocolate surface with natural positioning, showing correct shadows and depth, and no floating or misplaced instances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nuts are placed inside the chocolate structures and on top of them. They cast appropriate shadows, suggesting a three-dimensional depth and a secure placement on or within the chocolate. This creates a natural look, as the embellishments appear to be part of the overall design without appearing to float or be oddly positioned, which would detract from the realistic appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sparkle effects evenly distributed and faint enough to resemble light reflections on chocolate, without forming clusters or sharp, unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sparkle effects in Image B appear to mimic how light might naturally reflect off a chocolate surface, faintly and sporadically distributed to suggest subtle highlights. These sparkles do not form clusters or exhibit sharp edges, maintaining a natural and pleasing aesthetic that doesn't overpower the overall design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the new text “ChocoConifer Delights” clearly readable, properly spaced, and integrated into the base without overlapping or distorting the surrounding chocolate ring or motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'ChocoConifer Delights' is placed on the base of the chocolate structure, clearly readable and appropriately spaced. It appears as if intentionally integrated into the design, with no overlapping of the chocolate ring or motifs that would disrupt the visual balance. This suggests a professional and seamless branding implementation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the tiers of the tower evenly spaced and aligned vertically, preserving the original conical shape without bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower structure appears to maintain a consistent conical shape with evenly spaced tiers that align vertically. This suggests a careful design process to ensure the chocolate creation mirrors an idealized, symmetrical vertical orientation. Any bulging or skewing would disrupt the visual appeal and structural integrity of the tower.",
