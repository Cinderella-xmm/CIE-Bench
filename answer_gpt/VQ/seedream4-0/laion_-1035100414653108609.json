    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss textures are applied along the tusks of the warthog. By observing the curvature of the tusks, the moss seems to adhere closely to these curved surfaces, implying a natural growth pattern consistent with how moss might attach in reality. The shadows cast by the moss appear to be consistent with the lighting direction in the image, which suggests that there's a thoughtful blend of texture placement and shadowing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the waterfall-like mane flow continuously from the top of the head downward without intersecting or distorting the snout or ear regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane resembling a waterfall begins at the top of the warthog's head and flows naturally downward. The visual cues suggest a seamless cascade of hair without harsh intersections or distortions around the snout or ears, indicating a well-integrated design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the leaf-styled patterns aligned with the natural folds and contours of the warthog’s body, avoiding abrupt edges or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf-styled patterns on Image B follow the natural contours and bends of the warthog’s body. The patterns are intricately placed alongside the skin’s folds and edges, avoiding any sudden breaks or misalignments that would disrupt the natural body shape of the warthog.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fungi positioned along the spine and upper back without overlapping legs or protruding unnaturally into the air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fungi are situated along the spine and upper back of the warthog. This placement avoids interference with the legs, and the fungi do not appear to protrude unnaturally in the air, adhering to a logical and visually sensible arrangement.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing eyes remain within the eye sockets, preserving the shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the warthog having glowing eyes, which are visually contained within the natural eye sockets. The shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features appears intact without distortion, maintaining a believable depiction of the warthog with supernatural eyes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the branch-shaped hooves connect naturally to the lower legs and maintain consistent joint alignment without breaking the leg structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch-shaped hooves in Image B seem to connect naturally with the lower legs. They follow the leg structure without interrupting the alignment of joints, sustaining a consistent and cohesive appearance that ties into living characteristics of the creature.",
