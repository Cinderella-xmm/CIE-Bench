      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls feature pyramid-inspired designs that are coherent with the original pyramid structure without unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents chibi-style Russian nesting dolls painted with pyramid-inspired designs. The dolls feature simplified and playful renditions of pyramids, which fits the overall style and maintains coherence with the original pyramid structure seen in Image A. The shapes and decorations are consistent with the cartoon style of the dolls, but still resemble pyramid forms seen in Image A. Therefore, the design is coherent without appearing distorted or unnatural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls arranged in a descending size order on the wooden table without any distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls are placed in a sequence from largest to smallest, arranged on the table logically in descending order. Each doll gradually decreases in size, maintaining their expected proportions without distortion. This arrangement reflects typical nesting doll orders and complements natural visual scaling.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls retain a natural texture and fine details that resemble the stone texture of the original pyramid without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B possess a smooth, painted surface typical of crafted nesting dolls, which differs from the rough stone texture seen in Image A (the original pyramid structure). The change from stone texture to painted doll texture is inherent when transitioning from a stone pyramid to a wooden or painted object. Therefore, the introduction of fine painted details is fitting and does not create artifacts contradictory to the structure's style due to the natural change in materials.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition from the stone pyramid to chibi-style Russian nesting dolls preserve the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the scene without disrupting its visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transitions from the original pyramid to dolls representing pyramid motifs, naturally shifting from architectural form to artistic representation. Despite this transition, the playful style retains thematic relevance and avoids disrupting the visual harmony by maintaining consistent color schemes and themes between the pyramid and doll designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sophisticated wooden table complement the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls and fit naturally within the environment of the original image without introducing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden table in Image B serves as a fitting stage for the Russian nesting dolls, enhancing their presentation with a polished and visually appealing surface. While the original image A features a stone pyramid surrounded by nature, Image B's wooden context remains consistent with indoor or decorative presentation, avoiding introducing inconsistencies in styles when relating to the chibi dolls.",
