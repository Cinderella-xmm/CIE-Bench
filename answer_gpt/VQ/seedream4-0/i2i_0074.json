        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text elements are carefully placed on the image in a way that respects the natural lighting and shadows of the room's image. The font choice and color palette are chosen to match the elegant, serene atmosphere of the bedroom and do not introduce any disruptive textures.

      "question": "Are the proportions and placements of the newly added text elements appropriate, ensuring they do not distort the geometric shapes or disrupt the room’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric balance of the room's original setup is preserved as the text elements are strategically placed along the image's top and sides. The size of the text elements is proportional to the room's scale and dimensionality, not overshadowing the main focus on the bed and the painting. The text acts as a complementary feature rather than an overwhelming presence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text style in Image B uses a simple, modern font that resonates with the contemporary and minimalistic decor of the bedroom. The subtle monochrome colors used for the text elements do not clash with the warm and neutral tones of the furniture and decor, allowing for a cohesive look that does not distract from the room's aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the magazine cover design elements, when placed over the bedroom image, seem visually credible and avoid unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition of the text elements in Image B appears to be professionally integrated, as they align neatly with the natural lines and angles of the room elements like the ceiling and sides of the bed. The text placement does not introduce any visible artifacts and maintains a clean overlay, exhibiting a realistic appearance found in high-quality magazine covers.",

      "question": "Are the fine details within the added text elements (titles, headings, and price recommendations) preserved, ensuring their clarity and legibility without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text elements are clear and sharp with a good level of contrast against the background colors, ensuring high legibility. There is no visible pixelation or blurring of text, retaining the integrity and readability expected in a printed magazine cover format. The font and size choices contribute to maintaining the clarity despite the added elements.",
