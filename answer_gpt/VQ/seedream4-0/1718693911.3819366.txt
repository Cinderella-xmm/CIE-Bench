    "Question": "Q3: Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the sky, ocean, and sand background composed of solid color blocks with stark divisions, typical in illustrations without blended or natural gradients. This creates an abstract effect in place of textures or natural transitions seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
    "explanation": "The harness in Image B uses a smooth gradient fill, which contrasts with realistic fabric textures. Shadows under the cat are composed of gradient colors, characteristic of stylistic shading techniques in digital illustrations, as opposed to realistic light-based shading in photographic images like Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",

However, examining details such as the harness, there appear to be additional tones, suggesting the presence of other colors beyond the primary palette.",
    "answer": "No"
