      "question": "Are the floral motifs added to the elephant’s skin consistent in texture and scale with surrounding natural elements, and do they avoid pixelation, blurring, or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral motifs on the elephant's skin are drawn in a detailed manner, which is typical of Mughal art style, characterized by intricate and delicate patterns. The motifs appear to blend seamlessly with the artwork's aesthetic, maintaining a consistent motif scale relative to the size of the elephant and the other elements in the image, avoiding any pixelation or blurring often seen in poorly edited or enlarged digital content. The edges are clear and fit naturally with the overall illustration style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the rider’s Mughal-style attire exhibit natural fabric folds and shading, and are there no visible distortions in garment shape or unrealistic layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the rider wearing a traditional Mughal-style outfit, which typically includes elaborate patterns and fine textile work. The artist has used shading techniques to suggest fabric folds, giving the attire a three-dimensional look, which aligns with how clothes naturally drape over a human form. The garment does not show any distortions in shape or layering that would be characteristic of digitally, poorly altered images. The clothing appears consistent with the traditional motifs used elsewhere in the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the Mughal-style arches and domes structurally coherent, with smooth curves, correct perspective alignment, and no geometric distortions such as bent columns or skewed outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements like arches and domes are portrayed with structural precision. They feature smooth curves and consistent perspective, adhering to the symmetry and geometrical exactness associated with Mughal architecture. The columns and outlines are straight, and there are no visible distortions, ensuring that the structures appear stable and realistic within the context of the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the figures in the crowd display accurate limb proportions, distinct facial features, and consistent clothing details without overlapping bodies or distorted postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crowd figures are illustrated with a focus on maintaining balanced proportions and clarity. As this image is drawn in an illustrative style typical of traditional Mughal art, the emphasis is on the aesthetic of the group as a whole, where the individual details like facial features are more generalized. Despite this stylization, the clothing details are consistent and the arrangement avoids body overlapping and distorted postures, providing a coherent scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the distribution of ornamental elements (such as garlands, tassels, and patterns) balanced across the image, avoiding overcrowding or asymmetrical placement that disrupts visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, ornamental elements like garlands, tassels, and ornate patterns are portrayed with a balanced composition. The elements are evenly distributed throughout the image, complementing the central figure of the elephant and its rider. This balance avoids any sense of overcrowding and maintains a cohesive visual harmony, in line with traditional artwork, where aesthetic balance is highly valued.",
