      "question": "Do the exaggerated muscles on the athleteâ€™s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the athlete with exaggerated muscle definition, typical of artistic styles such as comic art, where contours are emphasized.
