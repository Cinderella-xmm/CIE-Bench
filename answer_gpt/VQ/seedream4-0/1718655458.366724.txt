    "Question": "Q1: Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all objects are in the form of LEGO bricks. These bricks have consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, which is characteristic of LEGO blocks. The edges of these bricks are straight and well-defined, with no visible warping or breakage. The structural integrity is preserved, as each brick looks solid and intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows LEGO bricks with a smooth surface, but there are visible reflections and highlights indicating a glossy surface, not typical of a standard matte LEGO finish. This suggests that the bricks do not have a uniform matte surface finish, as LEGO bricks usually have less pronounced reflections, emphasizing a more matte appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the LEGO bricks depict typical interlocking features such as studs on their tops. These are proportionally accurate and match the standard design necessary for LEGO pieces to interlock with each other. This reflects a standard LEGO brick configuration with recognizable features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B are placed on a wooden shelf surface, and there are no floating or suspended pieces evident within the image. All bricks appear to be grounded and arranged in a way that respects the rules of gravity and spatial logic, indicating a stable configuration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents a largely uniform and clean background with a neutral white tone. This lacks any significant textures, shadows, or depth cues, adhering strongly to a minimalist aesthetic. There is no complexity in the background that would detract from the clarity or simplicity intended.",
    "answer": "Yes"
