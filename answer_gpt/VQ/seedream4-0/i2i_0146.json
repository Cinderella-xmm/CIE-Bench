      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized representation of a zebra, akin to a cartoon or toy. The stripes are simplified and follow the general pattern of a zebra but lack the natural complexity and variation found in real zebra stripes. Instead, they are evenly spaced and consistent across its body without deviation, which suits the stylized nature of the image.",

      "question": "Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are drawn upright and in a style typical of cartoon representations. While they don't mirror the natural complexity of real zebra ears, as seen in Image A, they appear in a fixed, harmonious position relative to the stylized form of the zebra, showing no distortion or unnatural bending.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a zebra in a cartoonish manner, with deliberately exaggerated features such as oversized eyes and a compact body shape. These attributes are typical within the context of stylized animal representations and not considered distorted but rather fitting the playful design intention.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the zebra's coat as part of its stylized illustration, where the texture is smooth and consistent. There are no artifacts or pixelation apparent, aligning with the polished nature of cartoon character designs.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows grass styled to fit the cartoon environment, featuring sharp lines and distinct colors that complement the zebra's artificial style. While not natural in the same sense as in Image A, there are no obvious editing artifacts interfering with the overall appearance.",
