      "question": "Are the ivy formations on the hammerhead shaped like symmetrical, watchful eyes with natural leaf arrangement and no visible digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is on the owl sculpture with glowing eyes, replacing the hammerhead completely. The ivy formations described are not accurately present as eyes on the hammerhead. Instead, the eyes are a separate element of the owl sculpture, integrated as glowing features. They reflect a mystical addition rather than being actual leaf formations. Hence, ivy itself does not form symmetrical eyes in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered bark texture cover the hammer and anvil uniformly without abrupt color shifts, patchy areas, or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the anvilâ€™s transformation includes tree bark textures, and there is moss covering parts of the owl. The transformed anvil and hammer show consistent texture and color representation with a realistic fusion of tree bark and moss, avoiding artificial-looking patterns or abrupt color shifts. The blending looks natural in the context given.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roots under the anvil extend downward in a tapering manner that closely resembles actual tree roots. This design effectively imitates real roots by having varied thickness and smooth transitions from the base and avoiding any disjointed or floating appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the runes on the anvil are integrated with a glowing effect that suggests they are carved into the bark-like surface. The glow quality is well assimilated with the texture and does not lead to unnatural outlines or pixelation, maintaining a harmonious visual integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features ivy tendrils that logically follow natural paths around the window and furniture. However, due to the transformative artistic change in this image, the assessment focuses more on how tendrils interact with the owl and tree bark. They wrap around realistically, offering a coherent and logical climbing path without any suspension issues over hard surfaces.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the transformed anvil and hammer fall consistently with the light source from the window, and do they interact naturally with the wooden table and surrounding tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows are cast from the light source on the window. These fall naturally on the table and interact with adjacent tools, aligning appropriately with the glowing owl and the anvil roots, preserving a consistent light interaction pattern without conflicting shadow elements.",
