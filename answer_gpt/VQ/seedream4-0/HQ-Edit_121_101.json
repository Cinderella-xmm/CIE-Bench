    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns are created in a paper-cut style, where precision and cleanness of the cut edges are key features. The metallic foil highlights present on the sleeves and collar are uniform, giving a consistent appearance without any irregularities such as smudging or color bleeding.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow is centrally placed on the jeogori and is symmetrically aligned. The paper-cut design is inherently flat, which helps maintain the smooth appearance without real fabric folds, thus avoiding creases or distortion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the architectural elements in a stylized, paper-cut form. The roof lines and structural elements are precisely aligned, maintaining perspective consistent with traditional paper art without any skewing or inconsistent angles.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed leather-bound panel uniformly textured across its surface, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped elements meet the background, and does it provide a consistent depth impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embossed leather-bound panel is even throughout, showing consistency in texture and depth where the stamped elements integrate smoothly with the background, avoiding seams or irregularities.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B is rendered in a paper-cut style, revealing five fingers. The design maintains a naturally bent shape due to stylization. The chain follows a consistent path without interruption or appearing detached from the hand.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
