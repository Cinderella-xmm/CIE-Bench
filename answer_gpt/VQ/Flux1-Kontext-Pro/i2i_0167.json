      "question": "Does the front view of the apple maintain its original texture and color without any noticeable artifacts or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the front view of the apple appears in the top left panel. The apple's texture is rich and consistent, showing the natural speckling and color variations typically found on the surface of a real apple. The lighting accentuates its natural sheen without introducing any artificial or overly smooth areas. Therefore, the texture and color are maintained naturally in this view.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the cross-section reveal a natural, detailed texture of the apple's flesh, avoiding any unnatural or overly smooth appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cross-section of the apple shown in the top right and bottom left panels presents a detailed and slightly granular texture typical of an apple's flesh. Additionally, the seeds and core are visible with a natural appearance, avoiding any signs of unrealistic smoothness or digital manipulation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the top view of the appleâ€™s stem and calyx accurately represented with natural proportions and geometry, without any obvious distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the bottom right panel shows the top view of the apple. The stem and calyx are well-defined, with the typical recessed area surrounding them. This view maintains natural proportions and accurate geometry, with no evident distortions or digital artifacts.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shapes, sizes, and textures of the apple consistent across the front view, cross-section, and top view, ensuring structural coherence without any contradictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Across all views in Image B, the apple maintains consistent shapes, sizes, and textures. The front view, cross-sections, and top view all display a cohesive texture and similar characteristics in terms of lighting and natural appearance, indicating structural coherence without discrepancies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows in the cross-section and top view appear natural and consistent with those in the front view, contributing to a unified appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows observed in Image B appear cohesive across the different views. The same warm lighting with natural shadows is present in the cross-section and top view as seen in the front view, creating a unified and harmonious appearance, enhancing realism.",
