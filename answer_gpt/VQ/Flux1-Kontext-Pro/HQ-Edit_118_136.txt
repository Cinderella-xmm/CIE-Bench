    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic armor is aligned with the skater's body and maintains smooth, anatomically consistent contours. The bends at the elbows and knees appear realistic without stretching or distortion, indicating that the armor design respects anatomical proportions. This observation aligns with common knowledge of body armor designs in digital art, which typically adhere to natural human shapes to ensure believability.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the hoverboard’s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hoverboard’s deck appears well-structured and clear, with consistent transparency and glow effects that are smoothly applied. There are no visible digital artifacts like broken edges or random glow placements, which suggests coherent digital design. World knowledge supports that digitally rendered transparent surfaces should be clear and consistent to maintain realism, as seen here.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts graffiti with vibrant colors and possibly intended to look dynamic. While there's an impression of a digital animated display due to the neon-like glow, the smoothness of transitioning colors and lack of pixelation or jagged edges supports this interpretation. Common knowledge of digital art conventions suggests transitioning colors should be smooth without pixelation when representing animated elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, neon highlights on the skater’s armor and hoverboard are depicted as casting soft glows on surrounding surfaces. These glows do not produce harsh or unnatural reflections, nor is there any excessive color bleeding. The visual portrayal follows logical light behavior in digital art, where neon effects are usually smooth and consistent without overly disruptive reflections.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, motion lines are positioned to emphasize the movement trajectory of the skater and hoverboard. They follow a natural flow indicative of dynamic activity and do not intersect or disrupt key features such as limbs or the board, maintaining visual coherence. This aligns with the artistic understanding that motion lines should enhance the perception of speed and movement without disrupting the integrity of the main subject.",
    "answer": "Yes"
