    "Question": "Q1: Are the tentacle-like extensions smoothly integrated into the original curves of the facade without sudden angular breaks or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tentacle-like extensions appearing from the top of the structure are well-integrated with the original facade design, which features smooth and flowing curves. These extensions naturally follow the building's organic shapes without abrupt angular deviations or disconnects, which suggests skilled integration integrating naturally with the facade.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the fibrous textures follow the curvature of the facade and appear continuous without repeating patterns or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, the facade has been enhanced with fibrous textures that adhere to the curves of the building, following its sinusoidal form. These textures appear continuous, with no obvious repeating patterns or jagged edges, maintaining the aesthetic flow of the original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the window areas replaced with translucent membranes that maintain soft light transmission and lack sharp borders or visible seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the windows seem to be modified to appear like translucent membranes that allow some light to pass through softly. There are no visible signs of sharp borders or seams around these areas, which aids in creating a seamless transition between the facade and these window-like structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the iridescent scale patterns align with the surface curvature and display smooth color transitions without flat or distorted regions?",
    "explanation": "The iridescent scale patterns visible on the edited building in Image B align well with the form and flow of the facade, providing a natural fit with the building's surface. The colors transition smoothly across these scales without any noticeable flat or distorted areas, reflecting a high level of detail in their application.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the bio-luminescent lines emit a soft, uneven glow that fades naturally at the edges and interacts with nearby surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The bio-luminescent lines in Image B exhibit a soft glow that fades off naturally at their edges, and these lines appear to interact subtly with the surfaces around them, enhancing the mysterious and ethereal quality of the structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all modified elements—tentacles, membranes, textures, and glow lines—properly anchored to the building structure without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In the edited image, all the modifications, including tentacles, translucent membranes, textures, and glowing lines, are seamlessly integrated with no visible issues such as floating accessories or incorrect overlaps. These elements appear sturdy and well-anchored to the building's structure, maintaining the architectural coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters still visible and undistorted beneath the added textures and lighting effects?",
    "explanation": "The modifications in Image B focus on achieving a fantastical look by adding textures and lighting effects. However, these enhancements have obscured traditional features like the balcony railings, interior furniture, and planters, making them not clearly visible or potentially distorted under the new artistic elements.",
    "answer": "No"
