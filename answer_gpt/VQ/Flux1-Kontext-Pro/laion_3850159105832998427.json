      "question": "Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the golden horn-like spikes are additions to the headstock. These spikes must visually align with the center of the headstock and neck to maintain balance. Upon examining Image B, the spikes appear to be placed at equal distances from the neck, showing no signs of mismatched angles or clipping. Therefore, they align symmetrically with the neck.",

      "question": "Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, luminescent elements or runes should be clear and integrated into the fretboard, maintaining a consistent visual appearance. If runes seem as if they're added on top with a separate layer effect, they may appear as disconnected overlays. In this case, there are no luminescent runes visibly floating or disconnected from the wood.",

      "question": "Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, fiery tendrils are meant to extend along the guitar's body. A continuous path should connect components (bridge to nut) seamlessly. Examination reveals the tendrils originate from below the dragon body (near the tail), but do not visibly extend to or reach the nut of the guitar as required.",

      "question": "Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon's wings in Image B should appear symmetrical with scale patterns that mimic a realistic dragon texture. Looking at each side, the wings are of similar size and shape, and the pattern is evenly applied, avoiding gaps or visible distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B combines a dragon's body with the guitar shape. The smooth integration would preserve the guitar's silhouette while adding textures like scales. Although the dragon elements are prominent, the silhouette is modified slightly but retains consistent contours with no abrupt seams.",
