    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and mouth are drawn in a cartoonish style directly onto the surface of the whoopie pies, and they align well with the curvature of the cookie. The expressions wrap appropriately around the rounded surfaces, maintaining natural alignment without appearing as if they are floating above or separate from the cookies. This style matches common cartoon depictions, where features hug the surface of the character's form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of the whoopie pies have been stylized with cartoon coloring, which simplifies and smooths out the chocolate surface for aesthetic purposes. The cartoon representation eliminates detailed textures such as cracks and dimples, creating a more uniform and clean cartoon look, typical in animated styles that emphasize simplicity over texture details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "The limbs on the whoopie pie character in Image B are drawn as small arms and legs typical of simple cartoon characters. They appear proportionally smaller in relation to the cookie body, maintaining a cute and chibi-like proportion. The limbs are connected at logical points—the sides of the cookie for the arms and the bottom for the legs—and appear well-attached without signs of detachment or misalignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the whoopie pie character holds a spatula, which appears proportionally larger compared to the character's small arms, which is common in cartoon drawings to emphasize certain props. Despite this size exaggeration, the perspective and character's grip make the spatula appear as if it's naturally held during movement, standard in cartoons where exaggerated features are often used.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, only one whoopie pie character is present and it is complete, with no suggestion of peering over a plate's edge or having parts that appear floating or unnaturally cut-off. The depiction focuses on one whoopie pie character fully illustrated, which avoids potential issues with floating or improper placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the text bubble containing “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” placed adjacent to the speaking character without overlapping critical features like eyes or limbs, and is the handwritten font clear and unblurred?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubble with a message is properly positioned beside the speaking whoopie pie character and does not overlap critical features like eyes or limbs. Furthermore, the font is clear, readable, and maintains consistency with typical speech bubble usage in comics, ensuring the text stands out but does not interfere with the visual elements of the character.",
    "answer": "Yes"
