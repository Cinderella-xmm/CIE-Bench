    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D chibi-style bird maintain its natural appearance without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bird is depicted in a 3D chibi style, characterized by exaggerated and cute proportions typical of this artistic style. The textures appear smooth and consistent with the 3D cartoon renderings, designed to appear simplistic yet vivid, without any visible artifacts disrupting its form. This style inherently differs from realistic textures, yet there are no unnatural artifacts present that would compromise the cohesion of its appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
