    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the newly added mission control elements (such as consoles, screens, or panels) geometrically consistent with the room's perspective and do not appear to float or clip through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no added mission control elements, such as consoles, screens, or panels, visible in the image. Instead, the background consists of a space-themed design with various informational panels. Since there are no such elements to analyze for perspective or clipping, the question is inapplicable.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the color-coded sections for training stages (e.g., Physical Training, Technical Skills) have clean edges and are they positioned so they do not overlap or obscure the astronaut’s suit or feet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color-coded sections are visually distinct and have clean edges. They are positioned beside the astronaut and do not overlap or obscure the astronaut's suit or feet. This placement ensures that the information is legible and the astronaut's appearance is unaffected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative icons (e.g., treadmill, simulator) proportionally sized and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut so they do not appear oversized or misplaced in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrative icons are proportionally sized relative to the informational panels they accompany. They are placed at a suitable distance from the astronaut, ensuring they do not appear oversized or visually intrusive in relation to the main subject of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the explanatory text for each training stage clearly readable, properly aligned, and not overlapping with the astronaut’s body or suit components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explanatory text for each training stage is positioned within separate sections away from the astronaut's body. The text appears misarranged in some areas, making it less readable, but it does not overlap with the astronaut or suit components, maintaining distinction between the text and the astronaut.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the astronaut’s suit joints (e.g., elbows, knees), gloves, and helmet fully intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's suit, including joints, gloves, and helmet, appears intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details. The quality of these elements remains consistent with what would be expected in a detailed representation of a space suit.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the added mission control elements (e.g., consoles, icons) align with the direction of the original ceiling lighting and do not contradict the existing shadow patterns on the floor and astronaut?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no shadows from mission control elements such as consoles or icons, as these elements are not present in the image in a way that would cast shadows. The space theme and informational panels present do not exhibit shadows, thus the question of alignment with existing ceiling lighting does not apply.",
