    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges and transitions of the womanâ€™s clothing, hair, and facial features smooth and consistent with watercolor rendering, without jagged lines or unnatural texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's clothing, hair, and other features exhibit the smooth transitions and blending characteristic of watercolor art. The colors and edges blend softly without any harsh or jagged lines which is typical for watercolor illustrations. This indicates a consistency in rendering style appropriate for watercolor art.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elongated drape sections of the robe follow natural gravitational flow and maintain consistent fabric thickness and fold patterns without appearing stretched or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the folds of the robe cascade naturally and maintain a consistent thickness, showing an understanding of how fabric behaves under gravitational influence in art. The soft watercolor shading enhances the realistic depiction of the robe, ensuring it doesn't appear stretched or unnaturally suspended.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the botanical patterns on the robe evenly distributed, aligned with the fabric weave, and blended naturally with the surrounding colors without visible seams or repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the robe does not display any visible botanical patterns that require alignment or blending. The editing maintains simplicity often seen in watercolor, avoiding any excessive pattern work on the clothing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the leaf outlines within the book pages clearly defined, proportionally scaled to the page size, and integrated without distorting the book's spine, edges, or page curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf outlines on the book pages are distinctly visible, properly scaled, and integrated seamlessly with the page, creating a natural look without any distortion. The book maintains its realistic form, with the spine and curvature preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the added sun rays originate from a logical direction relative to the tree canopy and cast soft glows and subtle shadows that match the depth and density of the surrounding foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not explicitly showcase sun rays. The lighting in the watercolor illustration is soft and consistent but lacks specific sunray highlights. Without explicit rays, the lighting still complements the foliage and setting, but the question of added rays originating logically is not applicable.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the border positioned uniformly around the image edge, containing subtle literary symbols (e.g., books, quills), and does it not obscure or distort any part of the main subject or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not have a border with literary symbols like books or quills; it simply illustrates a scene without additional framing elements. The absence of a border ensures no obstruction or distortion of the main image or background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
