      "question": "Does the golden butterfly appear naturally lit and integrated into the scene without disrupting the existing light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden butterfly appears above the mirror and is well-lit, suggesting integration with the existing lighting setup around the mirror. The reflected light on the butterfly matches the ambient lighting provided by the backlit mirror, which contributes to a sense of natural lighting and integration into the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the material and texture of the golden butterfly consistent with the surrounding surfaces, avoiding any visible unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B appears to have an appropriate texture that matches its position above the mirror. Typically, a real metallic or glass surface butterfly would reflect the beautiful lighting and surfaces like the mirror, and in this image, there is no visible unnatural texture. The butterfly's visual integration suggests consistency with its surroundings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the shape of the golden butterfly structurally coherent and free from distortion, maintaining proper geometry as it appears above the mirror?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden butterfly in Image B maintains a clear and coherent geometry with well-defined wings and body. From its appearance, there is no observed distortion, and the shape aligns with how butterflies are typically structured, maintaining the expected geometry in the context of its position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the position of the golden butterfly above the mirror contribute positively to the overall composition without creating visual discontinuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the position of the golden butterfly just above the mirror acts as a visual focus point without interfering with the overall balance and harmony of the bathroom scene. It adds an aesthetically pleasing element that enhances the composition while maintaining continuity with the surrounding design elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the golden butterfly been preserved, ensuring clarity and sharpness in comparison to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B retains detailed features, such as the delicate patterns on its wings, which are clearly visible and sharp. This preservation of fine details is consistent with other elements within the image, ensuring no disparity in clarity and contributing to the overall sharpness and quality of the scene.",
