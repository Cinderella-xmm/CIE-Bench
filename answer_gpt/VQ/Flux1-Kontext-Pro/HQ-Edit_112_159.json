    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the glass display case surrounding the car and road clearly defined with smooth edges, proper transparency, and no floating or misaligned sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case is visually analyzed by observing the reflective and refractive properties typical to glass. The edges appear smooth and the transparency property allows the viewer to see the car and road clearly within the case, without any distortion. Common sense knowledge of how glass cases are structured supports this observation and suggests that no misalignment or suspension suggests realistic proportions and alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carâ€™s surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gradient transitions and preserved sharp detail lines along the body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is depicted with a metallic red color that reflects light, giving it a consistent appearance. The gradients smoothly transition across the curves of the car, typical of a high-quality metallic paint finish. Detail lines, such as panel gaps and aerodynamic shapes, are clearly visible and sharply defined, indicating high resolution and editing precision.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the resin layers in the road and cliff areas visibly distinct with gradual transparency and depth cues, avoiding flat or uniformly colored sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis of Image B reveals that the road and cliff areas have distinct resin layers, giving an impression of depth. The transparent property of resin allows for visible layering and depth effects, where shadows and highlights are appropriately placed to avoid flatness, consistent with resin artwork techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the micro gravel texture evenly distributed across the road and cliff surfaces, with natural variation in size and no repetitive or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of micro gravel is evaluated by observing the distribution and size across the surfaces. It appears naturally varied in size, giving an authentic look typical to gravel. There are no noticeable repetitive patterns, which align with how gravel is expected to be randomly distributed in nature.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the sunset sky panel blend smoothly with the original sky, maintaining consistent color gradients and horizon alignment without visible seams or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunset sky blends naturally with the rest of the scene, maintaining consistent color gradients typically seen during sunset. The horizon is aligned seamlessly with no visible seams or irregularities, suggesting a careful blending process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the car, road, cliffs, and display case consistent with a miniature scale, avoiding exaggerated or unrealistic sizing relationships?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is viewed as a miniature setup, where the car, road, cliffs, and display case are scaled proportionately to reflect a tiny scene. The car fits neatly within the road, the cliffs rise gently but not overwhelmingly, and the display case encompasses the scene without unrealistic size relationships, showing an adherence to creating an authentic miniature representation.",
