    "Question": "Q1: Does the textured grain overlay appear uniformly distributed across the entire image without causing visible distortion or obscuring fine details such as the soccer ballâ€™s pentagons or facial features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a textured grain overlay is applied across the image, simulating wear and age typical of vintage magazine covers. This effect is uniformly applied, providing a grainy texture without causing distortion or obscuring key details, including the intricate pentagons on the soccer ball. The texture adds to the vintage feel but does not overly blur or hide small important details.",
