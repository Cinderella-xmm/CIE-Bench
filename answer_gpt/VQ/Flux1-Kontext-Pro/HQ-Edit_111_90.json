      "question": "Are the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the transformed necklace clearly defined and free from geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace showcases intricate metal filigree patterns decorated with green gemstones. The design appears consistent and smoothly integrated, with no visible geometric distortions or inconsistencies in pattern continuity. The gemstones are aligned and positioned symmetrically, maintaining the artistic coherence of the design.",

      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original scaly texture and smooth curvature as it emerges from the mossy bank without sudden breaks or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snake tail in Image B shows a scaly texture typical of snakes, emerging gracefully from the mossy bank. Its curvature is smooth and natural, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural bends, conveying a realistic appearance of a snake moving through a natural habitat.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome visually transparent with consistent reflections and refractions across its surface, showing no jagged edges or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome covering the necklace and snake tail is transparent and seamlessly rendered. The reflections and refractions are consistent, creating a realistic portrayal of glass without jagged edges or evidence of digital artifacts, allowing a clear view of the object's interior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the emerald pond display natural water surface details such as subtle ripples and reflections, and are the silver leaves evenly shaped with consistent metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pond in Image B appears to have a smooth, emerald surface, but lacks visible natural water effects like ripples or reflections that would suggest realism. The silver leaves are depicted evenly with consistent metallic highlights, enhancing their aesthetic appeal despite the pond's lack of texture.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ornate branches supporting the chandelier proportionally sized and shaped to resemble natural plant structures without angular breaks or unnatural joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches in Image B supporting the necklace are proportioned and shaped to mimic natural plant structures. They have a smooth and consistent form without angular breaks or unnatural connections, contributing to an organic appearance that matches the surrounding natural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the new elements (pond, leaves, branches, dome) properly overlap and interact with the original necklace and snake tail without floating disjointedly or violating depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added elements, including the pond, leaves, branches, and dome, interact coherently with the original necklace and snake tail. They are positioned in a manner that respects realistic depth and spatial relations, giving the impression of an integrated and cohesive scene without disjointed or floating elements.",
