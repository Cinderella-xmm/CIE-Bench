      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables maintain their structural coherence and visual credibility after being transformed into a Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Cubism often involves fragmenting objects into geometric shapes and presenting multiple perspectives in a single image. In Image B, the diced vegetables (carrots, celery, and onions) maintain their basic cubic shape despite the painting-like transformation, which is consistent with a typical Cubist approach of slightly altering yet retaining recognizable objects. Therefore, the structural coherence, overall, appears credible as the shapes are still recognizable.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the diced carrots, celery, and onions natural and detailed, without any obvious loss of detail in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transforms the textures to resemble a painting rather than a photograph, which is characteristic of Cubism as it tends to abstract the textures to emphasize shapes and forms. This transformation leads to a noticeable loss of natural texture detail, such as the smoothness of the carrot cubes and fine details of celery and onion surfaces, which are obscured in the Cubist style. Therefore, the textures show an evident loss.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the diced carrots, celery, and onions appear authentic and harmonious, contributing to the overall natural appearance in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors are altered to fit the artistic style of Cubism, but they retain the overall hue representative of carrots (orange), celery (green), and onions (white). The transformation focuses on a less realistic, more stylized artistic representation, yet the colors themselves appear authentic within this context. While not naturalistic, the colors do not clash and contribute to a harmonious image composition.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the diced vegetables intact and undistorted, without any broken edges or unnatural deformations in the Cubist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Cubism often distorts or fragments shapes to showcase different perspectives simultaneously. In Image B, while the vegetables maintain their cubic form broadly, the edges become less defined and more stylized, typical of Cubist interpretation. Therefore, the structure is not entirely intact as minor distortions exist, reflecting the stylistic choice of Cubism.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the knife retain its natural appearance and structural integrity, without any obvious artifacts or distortions in the Cubist style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the knife's overall shape and design, similar to its natural appearance as seen in the original Image A. While the transformation changes the texture to align with the painting style of Cubism, there is no evident distortion in shape, so the knifeâ€™s structural integrity remains intact.",
