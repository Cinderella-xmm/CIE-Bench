      "question": "Are the sugar-crusted armor details on the donut surfaces uniform and free from unnatural pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sugar-crusted armor details represent the sugar texture on the donut surfaces. The art style is cartoonish, so the sugar and texture detail are simplified rather than hyper-realistic, conveying the characteristic appearance of a crusted donut without noticeable pixelation or unnatural repetition of texture patterns. Typically, such comic-style images streamline details to maintain uniformity, which seems achieved here.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the doughy limbs extend naturally from the donut bodies without distorting the circular shape or creating floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the donut characters have cartoon-like limbs that are drawn to fit naturally within the composition. They extend smoothly from the round donut forms, preserving the essential circular shape without awkward separations that would cause them to appear as floating segments. The cartoon style allows for exaggerated proportions, which are managed well here.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the icing eyes placed within the visible surface area of each donut and aligned with the curvature of the dough, avoiding floating or misaligned features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icing eyes of the animated donuts are positioned on the front faces, held within the circular space. They follow the curve of the donut forms, a common feature in cartoon drawing to create characters with expressive faces while maintaining element integrity. There is no indication of eyes floating or misalignment, fitting well into the design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the marshmallow spears and chocolate shields proportionate to the donut characters and correctly oriented as if being held or used?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spears and shields of the donut characters are appropriately sized and oriented. The marshmallow spears appear within range of the donuts' limb reach, and the chocolate shields seem manageable for them to wield, in line with cartoon logic where proportions are exaggerated yet contextually plausible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the coffee mug fortress positioned at a plausible scale and distance relative to the donut characters, without appearing unnaturally large or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress is actually a traditional castle structure rather than a coffee mug, suggesting that it aligns with a fantasy narrative theme rather than literal object scaling. It is positioned in a way that fits into a typically heroic cartoon landscape, suggesting its size and distance are consistent with the characters' narrative scale.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the playful fonts legible and cleanly outlined, with no pixelation or color bleeding at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fonts used for the text are designed to be engaging and are clearly outlined. The text on top 'THE DONUT DEFENSE CHRONICLES' and in the speech bubble are bold, easy to read without pixelation or color issues, ensuring clarity, which is optimal for comic presentations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the two comic panels clearly delineated and aligned in a way that supports readable narrative progression without visual confusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the comic panels are organized into distinct sections, each evidently separated with borders, facilitating a conventional reading order from left to right and top to bottom, which is intuitive for audiences accustomed to Western comic styles. There is no obscurity in panel progression or narrative conveyance.",
