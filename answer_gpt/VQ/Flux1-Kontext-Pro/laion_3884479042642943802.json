        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's pose appears natural with correct joint alignment and limb proportions.

      "question": "Is the rooftop ledge positioned directly under the character’s feet with consistent shadow direction and material texture that matches the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is crouching on a ledge that fits well with her positioning. The shadow direction is consistent with the background spotlighting, indicating proper environmental integration. The texture of the rooftop ledge matches well with a typical urban rooftop setting, enhancing the cohesiveness within the scene.",

      "question": "Are the distant skyscrapers and spotlights in the background properly scaled and positioned to match the character’s viewpoint and lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features skyscrapers and spotlights that are appropriately scaled for the perspective from which the character views them. The lighting aligns with the direction from which the real-world light sources in such an environment would typically illuminate both the scene and the character, maintaining consistency in size and light throughout.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the claws exhibit a metallic glint that follows the direction of the spotlight illumination without excessive or misplaced reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the claws on the character follow the direction of the incoming spotlight. The reflections on the metal are subtly represented and appear congruent with how light would naturally interact with a reflective surface in the depicted environment. The glint is neither overly exaggerated nor misplaced, providing a realistic visualization of metal under spotlight conditions.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B is clear and legible, with text that is appropriately sized and aligned within the bubble. It is strategically placed to ensure that it does not obstruct the character’s figure or disturb the visual balance of the scene, making it an effective part of the composition.",
