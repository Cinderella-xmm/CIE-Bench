      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower’s structure preserved with accurate proportions and no geometric distortions despite being scaled down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted within a glass dome, maintaining its iconic lattice structure and proportions. Based on common sense knowledge, the Tower should retain accurate proportions even when scaled down, as it is a highly recognizable structure with specific geometric features. Its visual depiction in Image B appears consistent with actual proportions and details, without distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is there a clear, seamless glass dome structure above the scene that fully encloses it without intersecting or distorting any elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a translucent glass dome encasing the scene and rests on a wooden base. Common sense tells us that glass domes are often used to protect miniatures. In Image B, the dome doesn’t distort or intersect any elements of the scene, indicating a seamless enclosure.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the snow cover on the ground, trees, and lampposts appear uniformly powdery and free of clumping or artificial texture patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow in Image B on the ground, trees, and lampposts appears evenly distributed and retains a powdery appearance. Common sense knowledge regarding snow explains that natural snow cover should appear consistent without unusual clumping, and this observation aligns with the characteristics shown in the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all human figures proportionally small, anatomically correct (including hands with no more than five fingers), and posed in natural stances without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures depicted are small and aligned with the miniature scale inside the dome. Each figure is posed naturally, and an analysis reveals their anatomy, including visible hands with standard finger count, lacks distortion. Knowledge of human proportions supports this visual interpretation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the streetlamps emit a faint, diffused glow without bright halos or overexposed areas, and are they aligned along the pathway as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlamps are aligned in the pathway similarly to Image A. Although there is no visible light emission in the edited image, common sense dictates that these miniature depictions should not have bright halos or overexposed areas given their scale, aligning with expectations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are cobblestone textures visibly embedded beneath the snow along the pathways, showing consistent patterns and fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow entirely covers the ground, and there is no visible cobblestone texture beneath it nor indication of patterns. The visibility of cobblestone textures would be expected in areas of thinner snow coverage. Therefore, they are not visible in the edited image with consistent fine detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the tree branches thin, naturally branched, and lightly dusted with snow without sagging or unnatural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents trees with thin branches that appear to branch naturally, lightly dusted with snow. Common sense regarding how trees appear during snowy conditions informs this interpretation, showing no signs of sagging or unnatural snow accumulation.",
      "weight": 1,
