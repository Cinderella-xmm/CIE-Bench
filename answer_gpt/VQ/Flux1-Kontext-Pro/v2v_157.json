      "question": "Do the books and diploma held by the owl appear to integrate seamlessly with the owl's body without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is holding a diploma and is situated on a stack of books. The diploma and books are elements needing to be integrated naturally with the owl's shape and texture for a seamless look. Analyzing Image B, these elements seem to merge well without visible seams or odd textures that suggest manipulation. The appearance is consistent with a high-quality graphic representation where the objects are part of the original design.",

      "question": "Does the graduation cap on the owl's head maintain the structural integrity of the owl's head, avoiding any distortion or unnatural geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the graduation cap sits on the owl's head. It is important for the cap to appear naturally placed, without distorting the owl's features. On inspection, the cap maintains smooth integration with the owl's head, adhering to its shape without unnatural bulges or flat areas, ensuring the owl's head appears as expected and intact.",

      "question": "Are the owl's feathers and eyes free from any loss of detail or unnatural textures, preserving their original quality and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, it is essential for the owl's feathers and eyes to maintain clarity and realistic texture to preserve its appearance. Examining the visible parts, there is no evidence of blurring, loss of detail, or added textures that seem artificial. The elements appear consistent, indicating preservation of these components' original quality.",

      "question": "Does the lighting in the image enhance the details of the owl and the added elements without creating any unnatural shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting should contribute to the visual coherence between the owl and the added elements. Analyzing the image, the lighting is even and complements the owl's features and the diploma and books, with shadows and highlights present where naturally expected, avoiding any jarring visual inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Are the books beneath the owl free from any unnatural textures or distortions, maintaining a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the books are foundational to the owl's position and must appear realistically rendered. Upon examination, the books display consistent texture and form; there are no visible signs of artificial manipulation that would disrupt their geometric or textural integrity.",
