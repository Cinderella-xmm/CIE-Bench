      "question": "Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden planks on the houseâ€™s walls are consistently spaced and aligned, demonstrating a seamless integration with no visible gaps or misalignments. The texture of the wood appears natural, indicating careful attention to detail in the model design. These observations suggest the planks are well-integrated visually and structurally as per common design practices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss texture appears on suitable surfaces such as the lower stone blocks and corners, which are typical places for moss growth due to the accumulation of moisture. The moss appears layered and organic, adapted well to the contours of the surfaces it covers, without any indication of floating or flat patches, ensuring realism in its placement and appearance.",

      "question": "Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements are uniformly toned to earthy colors, maintaining a consistent color scheme across these elements. There are no signs of inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration, suggesting a well-thought-out color palette and application that supports visual harmony in the design model.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature characters are appropriately scaled in relation to the house, fitting the expected proportion compared to the size of doors and other elements. Their positioning is plausible as they are near the doors or paths and are firmly grounded, showing no signs of floating or intersecting unnaturally with other structures, demonstrating thoughtful placement and scaling.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parchment board lies flat on the ground, showing realistic folds and texture that correspond to the parchment material. The shadows align with the apparent light source direction, enhancing the authenticity of its spatial relation and visual consistency, which indicates careful attention to detail in texture application and lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rule booklets show consistent page thickness and have visible spine details, displaying quality in model craftsmanship. The shadows cast by the booklets align with the lighting and the surface they rest on, demonstrating a coherent application of light and shadow principles suitable for this setting.",
