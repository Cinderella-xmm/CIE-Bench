      "question": "Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf are designed to mimic the appearance of carved wood. The textures are generally smooth, resembling a polished wood finish rather than a fabric weave. There is an appearance of consistent grain patterns and engraved details, following the expected structure of wood, rather than any kind of distortion or inconsistency that would arise in a poorly created texture. Given the constraints of the medium, these wood patterns appear natural and consistent with how wood would look when crafted into these shapes. Therefore, we can conclude that the materials and textures have been convincingly represented as wood.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, LEGO bricks are used to add detail to the hat. The bricks form a continuous layer around the rim of the hat. They are arranged in a manner that adheres to the physical structure you would expect in a realistic LEGO construction, maintaining consistent connection points without visible gaps or overlaps that would disrupt the physical integrity. There are no pieces floating or arranged inconsistently with LEGO construction norms, suggesting meticulous attention to how the pieces fit together.",

      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a light-colored wooden tabletop that is evenly lit. The lighting appears consistent with the subject, and there are no obvious harsh shadows or lighting mismatches that would indicate poor compositing. The transition between different parts of the image is smooth, creating a cohesive composition that integrates the subject seamlessly with the background.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ear flaps on the wood-carved hat appear symmetrical, mirroring each other's shape and positioning on the left and right sides of the dog's head. There are no visible signs of deformation or disproportionate scaling, as the ear flaps maintain a consistent size and orientation. This suggests careful attention to maintaining balance and symmetry in the design, aligning with expectations for a symmetrical accessory.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are prominently displayed along the hat's rim. These bricks exhibit consistent edge definition with proper shading, providing a three-dimensional appearance, which matches expectations for how light would naturally interact with such surfaces. The placement is logical, adhering to the curvature of the hat and forming a continuous boundary. There are no visible artifacts or clusters of color that would disrupt the visual continuity or logical assembly of the bricks.",
