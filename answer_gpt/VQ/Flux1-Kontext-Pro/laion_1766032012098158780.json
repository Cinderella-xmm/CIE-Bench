      "question": "Does the transparent glass material retain the denim blue tint without unnatural color bleeding or inconsistent opacity across the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is transparent and is filled with a liquid that has a denim blue tint. The surface of the bottle appears smooth, clear, and evenly dispersed without signs of unnatural color bleeding or inconsistent opacity across the glass material. The use of glass for perfume bottles ensures uniform transparency as observed in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed metallic branding elements positioned correctly over the original back pocket area without distorting the surrounding fabric or creating visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a perfume bottle with branding ('Tlabix') embossed on the front, which appears perfectly positioned without distorting surrounding elements such as the glass material. In the context of a denim jeans comparison, metallic elements on garments must be placed without creating fabric distortions or seams. Image B performs this correctly with its uniformly embossed branding.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silver button-shaped cap properly aligned with the waistband and securely attached without gaps or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle cap is metallic silver shaped and securely attached to the neck of the perfume bottle, aligned with the contour of the bottle without gaps between the cap and bottle, or a floating appearance. Alignment in design ensures cohesion, as observed in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lace-up details on both legs have symmetrical threading and bow knots that follow the natural curve of the leg without distortion or clipping through the fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't contain lace-up or fabric details as it displays a perfume bottle. When assessing clothing, symmetrical threading and detailing should follow the fabric's natural curves without distortion, similar to how a well-shaped bottle exhibits a consistent form with uniform elements, ensuring symmetry and lack of distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the flared leg section maintain smooth, continuous curvature without sharp breaks, pixelation, or stretched textures indicating geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a perfume bottle with smooth continuous curves, devoid of geometric distortions such as sharp breaks or pixelation. In garment design, continuity in curves ensures smooth aesthetic lines, similar to the uniform shape seen in this bottle without breaks or distortion.",
