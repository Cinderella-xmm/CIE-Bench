      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface exhibits a consistent satin paper texture, offering a soft appearance. There are subtle reflections that do not result in harsh glare, and the overall texture avoids pixelation, contributing to a smooth and cohesive look.",
