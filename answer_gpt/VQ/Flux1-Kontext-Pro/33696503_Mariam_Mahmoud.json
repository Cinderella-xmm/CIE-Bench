      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the orange lifebuoy still clearly visible as a circular object centered within the intended eye area, with white foamy textures extending outward like lashes without breaking the circle's outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular shape is intended to replicate the visual concept of an eye, with surrounding white textures resembling lashes. However, the original lifebuoy from Image A seems to have been replaced by an abstract design that suggests an eye structure on the creature. The circular form is not a lifebuoy anymore; it's part of a larger design symbolizing an eye and lacks the sharp separation from white lashes, which are now part of the cohesive artistic representation of a creature, not a clearly outlined circular lifebuoy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the netting sections along the shoreline transformed into soft, undulating fin shapes with gradual transitions from mesh to organic form, lacking sharp angles or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the netting from Image A is not visible in the traditional sense. Instead, there are smooth and organic transitions suggestive of fins on a creature. The image presents a cohesive organic form that resembles a fish, characterized by the absence of angular or pixelated details, indicating an artistic transformation into fluid forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shoreline curve smoothly into a continuous, rounded body shape with wave-like ridges embedded in the sand, without sudden kinks or flat regions disrupting the flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents a cohesive creature submerged in water with a smooth, rounded form suggestive of a whale or similar aquatic animal. The body transitions seamlessly into the water, lacking the angular elements or flat spots seen in Image A where the shoreline interacts with the sea. This demonstrates a more organic and fluid representation devoid of interruptions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sea-green markings distributed evenly across the sandy surface with soft, diffused edges and no visible pixels, overlays, or repeating patterns that suggest artificial addition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandy surface has been artistically transformed into the body of a creature with a consistent color scheme that integrates smoothly into the oceanic theme. The sea-green markings and overall coloration infuse naturally without obvious pixelation, overlays, or artificial repetitions, contributing to an appearance that feels organic and well-blended.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the eye (lifebuoy), fins (netting), and body (shoreline) align in a way that suggests a single, cohesive organism with logical proportions and no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual transformation is artfully arranged with elements resembling an eye, fins, and a body forming a unified creature. There are no disjointed or disproportionate features, and the composition reflects a coherent organism exhibiting logical anatomical proportions. This indicates the artistic intention to portray a single, complete entity.",
