    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed topiary structures maintain smooth, continuous surfaces and natural-looking textures without visible distortion or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the topiary structures are visually inspected for smoothness and continuity. The topiaries are sculpted with a precise, clean finish representing realistic hedge shaping. The natural texture is preserved, and there is no pixelation or distortion evident, indicating meticulous editing to maintain realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the water in the fountain exhibit consistent transparency and refraction effects, with no unnatural streaks or broken flow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in Image B appears clear and smooth, flowing naturally down the fountain and into the basin. The light interaction with water, including transparency and refraction, creates a realistic depiction of water, with no discontinuous patterns or awkward streaks. This indicates a well-executed rendering of water behavior in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spiral vine paths seamlessly integrated into the garden landscape, with gradual transitions and no sudden breaks or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral vine paths ascend gracefully along the topiary structures, smoothly blending with the greenery. There are no abrupt terminations or disjointed segments, and the vines follow a coherent and continuous path that integrates with the overall garden structure, enhancing the aesthetic seamlessly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly-like creatures positioned at varying depths in the scene, with appropriate size scaling and soft edges that match the ambient lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterflies are depicted at varying depths, contributing to the scene's sense of space and perspective. Their size changes according to distance from the viewer, and their colors and edges are softly merged with the lighting conditions of the scene, giving them a natural appearance within the environment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floral crowns positioned at the tops of the topiary structures with natural attachment points and no floating or misaligned petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral crowns in Image B are evidently perched atop the topiary structures with convincing points of attachment. The petals align naturally with the flowers and do not appear to float or misalign, ensuring they aesthetically and realistically complement the garden design.",
