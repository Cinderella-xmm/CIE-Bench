      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plush toy wings have simplified shapes with unnatural uniformity and lack of anatomical features such as joint areas and wing tips. They appear more rounded and uniform, which is indicative of plush toys rather than representing the articulation and tapering found in real chicken wings. This suggests deformation and unnatural stretching compared to real wings.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowlâ€™s edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange object, which visually resembles a sauce more than a pillow, fits snugly within the bowl without causing any visible distortion to the bowl's edges. The object is properly scaled and shaped to sit naturally within the confines of the bowl's boundaries.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the light-colored wooden surface is uniformly smooth and does not show any digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts. The surface displays consistent natural wood grain patterns, giving an impression of a well-finished wooden texture.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings has a clearly visible soft and fuzzy texture typical of plush materials, lacking any form of raised or granular texture that would suggest crunchiness. The material reflects light in a way that indicates it is soft fabric rather than crunchy food.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A, the orange object in the bowl (which resembles sauce, not a pillow) in Image B is positioned correctly in the same location as the original sauce in Image A, maintaining alignment and depth relative to the plate and plush wings. There is no indication of overlapping or floating.",
