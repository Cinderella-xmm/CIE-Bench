      "question": "Does the glass container display natural transparency with visible embossed patterns that do not appear distorted or unnaturally stretched?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container has a visible embossed pattern that appears intricate and detailed. The transparency is maintained, offering a clear view of the candle within without distortion. The patterns on the glass are well-defined and consistent, which suggests that the patterns are not unnaturally stretched. The light reflections and the presence of a visible candle further support the natural transparency appearance. Hence, looking at visual cues combined with knowledge of how embossed glass typically looks, the patterns retain their intended design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the candle snuffer finial proportionally aligned with the glass container and structurally connected without gaps or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candle snuffer finial in Image B sits centrally and proportionally on top of the glass container, maintaining a logical structural alignment typical of teapot designs. The connection appears seamless with no visible gaps, suggesting the finial is an integral part of the glass container's design rather than floating independently. The consistent material and reflection behavior additionally support a continuous connection.",

      "question": "Does the marble base show consistent veining and reflective surface without any remnants of lace texture or unnatural seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble base exhibits a smooth, reflective surface with consistent veining reminiscent of real marble. There are no visible remnants of lace textures or any unnatural seams disrupting the surface. This aligns with the expected properties of a well-polished marble, suggesting that the texture transformation from the lace-covered table in Image A has been effectively completed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the nameplate attached to the side of the container at a natural height and angle, with no floating or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the nameplate is affixed to the glass container at an appropriate height and angle, following the contours of the teapot's surface. It does not appear to be floating or exhibiting clipping artifacts; rather, it seems to be a thoughtfully designed component of the container. The nameplate's position and alignment look coherent with the overall symmetry and design aesthetics of the container.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections and shadows on the glass container, marble base, and finial align with the direction of the light source and exhibit consistent material behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflections and shadows across the glass container, marble base, and finial are consistently aligned with the light source, which appears to be coming from the upper left. The reflections on the metallic surfaces and the transparency of the glass are consistent with how light interacts with such materials. The seamless transition of shadows on the marble base and its reflective quality further implies accurate adherence to light physics.",
