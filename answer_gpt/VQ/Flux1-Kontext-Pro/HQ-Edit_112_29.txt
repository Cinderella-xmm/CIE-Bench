    "Question": "Q1: Does the ship retain its original structural shape and proportion when rendered as part of a spherical globe, without visible warping or stretching of the hull or sails?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ship maintains traditional features such as masts and sails with correct proportions. The design doesn't show signs of distortion, which suggests careful rendering to fit within the spherical dome of the globe while avoiding warping. Typically, spherical elements can cause visual distortion, but in this image, such effects are minimized.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome transparent with realistic reflections and refractions, and does the wooden base display natural wood grain and intricate compass engravings without pixelation or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is rendered with smoothness and transparency, indicative of high-quality reflections and refractions. These are key features in capturing the realistic behavior of light with glass objects. Additionally, the wooden base appears to have intricate engravings and a natural wood grain that is discernible, presenting a realistic texture without visible pixelation or identical textural pattern repetition, indicating a high level of detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the sea creatures clearly visible beneath the ship, properly scaled, and positioned in a manner consistent with underwater motion, without appearing floating unnaturally or distorted?",
    "explanation": "Beneath the ship in Image B, the sea creatures are well-positioned with scales and appearances that align with natural aquatic movement. They possess clear body structure and do not appear to be distorted or floating unnaturally. Their depiction follows realistic underwater motion principles, considering the distance and perspective within the globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the sails exhibit fine fabric details such as wrinkles and weave patterns that align with the lighting direction and do not show unnatural seams or repeating patterns?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the sails with fine material details where wrinkles and weave patterns are visible. These textures match the light direction and provide depth and realism, avoiding visual errors like unnatural seams or repeating patterns. This corresponds with precise digital rendering techniques.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the internal clouds smoothly shaped and distributed within the dome without clipping into the ship or glass surface, and do they have soft edges and luminous quality consistent with being lit from above?",
    "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are smoothly shaped and appear to be thoughtfully distributed, avoiding any clipping issues with the ship or glass surface. They have soft edges and a luminous quality consistent under overhead lighting, thus reflecting realism in the way clouds are typically portrayed in proximity to a light source.",
    "answer": "Yes"
