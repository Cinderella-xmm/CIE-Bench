      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's body is carved from wood, displaying a uniform texture and shading consistent with wooden sculptures. The appearance is smooth and cohesive, simulating natural wood characteristics without any abrupt color changes or non-wood-like patches. The consistent appearance suggests careful craftsmanship in the carving process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the gorilla's body in Image B are sculpted to mirror the natural wood grain. They display variations in depth and direction, mimicking the randomness and organic nature of genuine fur and wood textures rather than exhibiting uniform or mechanical lines. This indicates attention to detail in achieving a naturalistic portrayal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anatomically correct proportions and joint structures of the gorilla are maintained within the wood sculpture. The limbs are accurately represented with appropriate curvature and form, avoiding any excessive smoothing that would result in flattened or unnaturally curved sections. This indicates precise craftsmanship in the wooden representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features etched wood patterns with intricately integrated darker leaf shapes. These elements maintain depth and layering, creating a cohesive and harmonious scene that effectively connects with the gorilla. The integration is such that the scene doesn't appear flat or disjointed, but rather as a thoughtful extension of the wooden sculpture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the carved scene of Image B, the scattered leaves are rendered in darker wood tones and are positioned in a way that suggests they are naturally resting or embedded into the wooden surface. There are no indications of incorrect floating or overlapping, which shows a considered design of their placement to mimic natural settings.",
