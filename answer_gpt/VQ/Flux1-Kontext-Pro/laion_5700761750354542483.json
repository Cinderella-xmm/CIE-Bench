    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the embroidered patterns on the butterfly’s wings and body aligned with the original gemstone positions and do they display consistent thread density and color without visible breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly retains the positions of gemstones similar to those in Image A. The replacement of gemstones with embroidered patterns is analyzed through the appearance of maintained alignment and consistent distribution in Image B, with no visible inconsistency in thread density or color. The embroidery maintains good alignment with the original gemstone layout and shows no visible breaks or misalignments along the patterns, reflecting a precise conversion from gemstones to embroidery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the butterfly’s body and frame appear made of soft fabric with no visible metallic shine or rigid edges, and does it show natural fabric folds or drape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually presents a butterfly with a clearly metallic body and frame, marked by a defined structure and a shiny luster typical of metal craftsmanship. This is contrasted with a soft, foldable fabric appearance, as metal has reflective properties and solid form without folds or draping. The overall look of the butterfly is stiff and polished, not soft or fabric-like.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wing surfaces exhibit a uniform, matte, soft-textured appearance consistent with velvet, with no shiny spots or reflections resembling gemstones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing surfaces are adorned with what appears to be a sequence of small, reflective elements characteristic of gemstones. These elements produce shiny spots and reflections, creating a textured appearance but not a matte, soft-textured velvet-like look, which would lack such gleaming reflections. This indicates the presence of hard, reflective surfaces instead of a uniform, soft appearance.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fluffy trim along the wing edges evenly distributed, soft, and attached in a way that follows the wing’s natural curve without appearing detached or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wing edges featuring some soft, fluffy elements, but they seem minimal and not prominently fluffy or evenly distributed. They do follow the curve to an extent but are not as pronounced as typically expected from a deliberate trim. The fluffy accents are subtle and may not fully meet a fluffy trim's description with noticeable fullness and consistent attachment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the butterfly’s wings symmetrically shaped, the body proportionate to the wings, and the antennae correctly positioned and curved, with no visible warping or scaling errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the butterfly possesses symmetrically shaped wings, proportionate to its body. The antennae are in correct positions and demonstrate appropriate curving without any visible defects. The overall structure is cohesive, with no evident asymmetry or distortions observable, indicating a well-crafted design.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the butterfly resting on a smooth, uniformly pearl-white cushion with a natural shadow underneath, indicating proper contact and physical grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly is positioned on what appears to be a light-colored, smooth surface that resembles a pearl-white cushion. The surface is positioned beneath the butterfly, with shadows creating a sense of grounding and contact with the surface, contributing to a realistic appearance of rest.",
