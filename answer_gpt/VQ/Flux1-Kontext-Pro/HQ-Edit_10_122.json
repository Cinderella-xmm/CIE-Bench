      "question": "Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterned textile on the character's top includes geometric shapes such as squares and circles, arranged neatly and consistently throughout the fabric. The color gradients are smooth and exhibit harmony, resembling the appearance of traditional African wax prints or fabrics. There are no visible distortions or digital artifacts, providing a realistic texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces clearly defined, proportionally accurate, and free from distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold earrings and necklaces have clear tribal designs and motifs, which are symmetrically arranged and proportionally accurate. The surfaces reflect light realistically, without showing distorted edges or unnatural reflections, contributing to an authentic look of traditional African jewelry.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the abstracted umbrellas in the background are drawn with believable proportions, correctly placed above the market stalls to suggest a realistic scene. They appear grounded relative to the stalls, maintaining consistent spatial relationships without overlapping or seeming as if they are floating unnaturally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the musical notes distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories around the character’s head, without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs in their paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the musical notes are scattered around the character’s head in visually pleasing and balanced trajectories. Each note is distinct, following a logical path without abrupt breaks or cutoffs, appearing naturally as if surrounding the character in a melody-filled setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character’s right hand show five fingers with correct proportions, natural curvature, and realistic skin texture, without any missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s right hand displays five fingers with anatomically correct proportions and natural curves. The skin texture is rendered realistically, contributing to the lifelike appearance of the hand without any errors such as missing, duplicated, or distorted fingers.",
