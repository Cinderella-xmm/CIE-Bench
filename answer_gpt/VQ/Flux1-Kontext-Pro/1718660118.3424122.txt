    "Question": "Q1: Do the brass and copper elements on the uniform show natural surface variations, such as subtle scratches, patina, and reflective highlights, without appearing uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a uniform with brass and copper elements that exhibit natural surface variations. These elements display subtle scratches and patina, which can be observed as areas of varied texture and light reflection, indicating that the uniform does not appear uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy. The reflective highlights and textural differences contribute to a realistic portrayal of metallic surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the gear components on the uniform properly embedded within the fabric structure, maintaining consistent depth and avoiding overlapping or misaligned teeth that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gear components present on the uniform appear to be properly embedded within the fabric. They are integrated and positioned such that their teeth are aligned correctly without overlapping or misalignment. This consistent embedding ensures that there is no break in geometric continuity, indicating that the design has been executed with attention to detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the mechanical throne have visible support structures and grounding that prevent it from appearing suspended or unstable, with all cogwheels and braces attached logically to the frame?",
    "explanation": "The throne in Image B appears mechanically stable, as it features visible support structures and grounding elements. The cogwheels and braces are logically attached to the frame, contributing to an impression of structural integrity. These details ensure the throne does not appear suspended or unstable, instead looking securely anchored.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the copper, brown, and dark green hues distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background, with transitions between colors following natural lighting gradients and avoiding abrupt or patchy changes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors such as copper, brown, and dark green are distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background. The transitions between these hues follow natural lighting gradients, leading to smooth transitions that avoid abrupt or patchy changes. These color gradations contribute to the overall harmonious aesthetic of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the steam trails in the background have gradual opacity and wispy edges, flowing naturally from potential sources like vents or machinery, without sharp outlines or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The steam trails in the background of Image B are depicted with gradual opacity and wispy edges. They appear to flow naturally, suggesting they originate from potential sources like vents or machinery. There are no sharp outlines or pixelation visible, indicating that the trails are rendered realistically.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Do both hands display five fingers with proper spacing and curvature, and are the knuckles and fingernails rendered with natural detail, without any fused, missing, or duplicated digits?",
    "explanation": "Both hands in Image B are depicted with five fingers each. The fingers display proper spacing and curvature, and the knuckles and fingernails are rendered with natural detail. There are no signs of fused, missing, or duplicated digits, ensuring that the hands appear anatomically correct.",
    "answer": "Yes"
