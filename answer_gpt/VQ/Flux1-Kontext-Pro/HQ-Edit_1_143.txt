    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features of the scientist proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes such as elongated eyes, misaligned nose, or uneven lip contours?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the facial features are blurred, rendering it impossible to definitively evaluate their proportional accuracy or identify any exaggerated or distorted shapes. Therefore, we cannot confirm if they adhere to typical human proportions or dimensions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the lab coat exhibit natural fabric folds and subtle shading consistent with real-world draping, without appearing uniformly flat or lacking depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the lab coat does have illustrative-style characteristics with less realistic fabric folds and shading compared to Image A. The coat in Image B appears more flat, typical of a drawn or cartoon style, lacking the subtle depth and complexity of shading observed in real clothing.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the hand holding the pipette have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are the joints and knuckles positioned realistically?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the pipette is stylistically drawn and maintains five fingers with a generally natural curvature and spacing. Although more simplistic due to its artistic nature, the basic structure appears correct in terms of finger count and plausible positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the test tubes display uniform liquid levels and clear glass surfaces with coherent reflections and refractions, without visible texture distortions or broken geometric outlines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the test tubes have consistent liquid levels and uniformity across their surfaces. Despite the illustrative style, there is no visible distortion or broken outlines affecting their appearance, maintaining coherence with the stylized theme.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the components of the microscope and adjacent control panel correctly aligned and proportionally scaled, with no misplaced parts or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the microscope and control panel are depicted in a stylized manner but retain logical alignment and scale relative to each other. The placement appears consistent with how such components would realistically be arranged, without any floating or misplaced elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
