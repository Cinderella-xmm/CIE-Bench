    "Question": "Q1: Does the kimono display consistent, non-distorted fabric folds with visible, harmonious pattern details that align with the woodblock print aesthetic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono displays harmonious pattern details typical of woodblock prints, following the traditional Japanese art style. The fabric folds are consistent and align with the aesthetic conventions of woodblock print art, characterized by clean lines and stylized patterns.

    "Question": "Q2: Are the cherry blossom petals in the air and on the ground evenly distributed with clear, non-overlapping edges and consistent size variation typical of stylized woodblock art?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom petals are evenly distributed in the scene, both in the air and on the ground. They maintain clear, non-overlapping edges and display a consistent size variation which aligns with the stylized nature of woodblock art.

    "Question": "Q3: Is the matte texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring facial features, fabric patterns, or the basketâ€™s weave structure?",
    "explanation": "The matte texture in Image B is applied uniformly across the entire image, giving it a consistent look that aligns with woodblock print style. It does not obscure fabric patterns or the basket's weave structure because the details are simplified as per the woodblock art style, rather than detailed like in Image A. The texture enhances the stylistic representation without causing loss of detail or obscuration based on the comparison.",
