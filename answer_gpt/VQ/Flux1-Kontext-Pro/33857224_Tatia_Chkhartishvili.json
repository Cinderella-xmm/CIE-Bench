      "question": "Is the head proportionally enlarged but still geometrically consistent with the neck and shoulders, without unnatural stretching or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head size appears proportionally larger than what is typically seen in real human anatomy, adhering to a chibi style commonly seen in animation and cartoon designs. Chibi characters often have exaggerated head sizes while maintaining proportional consistency with other body parts such as neck and shoulders, which we can observe here. The neck and shoulders are aligned with the head's proportions, showing consistency without unnatural elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the body, dress, and hair uniformly rendered with a soft rubber texture, free from conflicting textures or glossy reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the character as a keychain, where the surfaces typically feature a uniform rubber-like texture. The body, dress, and hair exhibit a matte finish that is common in rubber or silicone materials used for keychain designs. No glossy reflections or conflicting textures are present, ensuring a consistent material appearance throughout the keychain.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red boots and lace dress clearly identifiable with preserved structural details such as buckles, stitching, and knit patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of red boots includes visible elements like buckles, indicative of the simplified yet recognizable design in keychain models. However, finer details like stitching or knit patterns on the lace dress are typically not preserved at this small scale, and the dress is rendered with an outline for simplicity. This approach focuses on achieving clarity through bold outlines rather than intricate details.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bent posture maintain anatomical alignment of the spine, hips, and knees without unnatural angles or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character in a stylized bent posture characteristic of cartoon designs. The anatomical alignment is simplified to maintain coherence within the chibi style, with no floating segments. Despite the exaggerated pose typical of this style, the structure appears consistent and without unnatural angles, aligning with stylized cartoon anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the silver keyring visibly connected to the character without gaps or overlapping edges, and does the wooden plank background show consistent texture and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a clear connection between the silver keyring and the character, with no visible gaps or overlapping edges, ensuring structural integrity typical in keychain designs. The wooden plank background exhibits uniform texture and spacing, creating a consistent backdrop without variability.",
