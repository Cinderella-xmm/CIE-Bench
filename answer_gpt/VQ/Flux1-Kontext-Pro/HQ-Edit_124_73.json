      "question": "Are the floral motifs added to the elephant’s skin consistent in texture and scale with surrounding natural elements, and do they avoid pixelation, blurring, or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the elephant's skin for floral motifs, there is no noticeable pixelation or blurred areas around these details. The texture and scale of the floral motifs appear consistent with natural elements depicted elsewhere in the image. When assessing consistency, it is crucial to consider both their integration in the image and the quality of detail, such as edges and texture. The motifs remain well-integrated and maintain their clarity, ensuring natural appearance.",
