      "question": "Does the book animation on the clock face align perfectly with the curved top and vertical frame of the clock, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock is drawn in a stylized, artistic manner which seems to interpret the structure rather than recreate it with realistic proportions. The book-like structure on the clock face lacks realistic alignment and proportions given the stylized sketch-like representation. World knowledge suggests that precise alignment and proportions might be distorted in such artistic renderings. The artistic choice inherently features irregularities typical of hand-drawn illustrations, meaning perfect alignment is unlikely.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the text snippets embedded in the wallpaper clearly legible, evenly spaced, and seamlessly blended into the background pattern without creating unnatural shadows or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text snippets form part of the artistic illustration akin to a vintage document or poster. The stylization causes some text to be hard to decipher, often not clearly legible due to the illustrative style and faux-aged effect. World knowledge about such illustrations indicates that text might not blend perfectly with the background due to the hand-drawn nature, impacting readability and spacing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the image of the ancient sundial inside the framed artwork properly scaled, centered, and rendered with consistent lighting and depth relative to the original frame and surrounding wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the sundial is more of a conceptual outline drawing rather than a scale depiction. This stylization generally includes inconsistent scaling and depth as part of its appeal. Given the illustrated nature and lack of realistic rendering qualities, properly scaled and consistent depth in relation to the frame and surrounding walls is unlikely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the pen-shaped clock hands appear structurally sound, properly aligned with the bookâ€™s cover, and free from distortion such as bent metal parts or mismatched shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock hands, sketched akin to pens, are a part of the artistic illustration and do not directly relate to any book cover. Given the sketch nature, there are inherent distortions and misalignments typical of hand-drawn representations. Such illustrations often carry structural exaggerations or stylistic deviations from reality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the captions placed in the room clearly readable, stylistically consistent with art-nouveau design, and physically integrated into their respective surfaces without overlapping or distorting underlying materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the captions and text are part of the sketched, poster-like illustration which follows a vintage but not necessarily art-nouveau design. The integration of text in such art can lead to readability issues and stylistic inconsistencies, especially given the hand-drawn nature which might affect alignment and overlapping. Consistency with stylistic theme doesn't guarantee integration without distortion.",
