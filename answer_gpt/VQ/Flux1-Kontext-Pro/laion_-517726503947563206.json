      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hull of the ship exhibits an iridescent, reflective texture that appears consistent across its surface. Examining the visual cues, the hull does not show blocky or repetitive patterns. The iridescence suggests natural light play across a smooth, crystalline surface, which maintains a uniform translucency and color shift. This observation aligns with the characteristics of well-rendered crystal textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows on the ship appear to have been transformed into faceted surfaces. However, upon closer inspection, these windows do not exhibit the qualities of gem-like facets with the natural reflection of light or consistent edge sharpness that one would expect from actual faceted gems. Instead, they appear as irregular or indistinct areas, lacking definition and clear depth, which suggests that the transformation may not meet the standard of true gem-like windows.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The deck surfaces in Image B give an impression of being remodeled with crystal-like features. Yet, they do not exhibit a flawless continuum indicative of expertly crafted crystal pathways. Observations indicate there may be abrupt transitions or inconsistencies, such as disruptions or areas that don't harmonize with the overall structured crystalline appearance. Thus, the decks fail to meet the criteria of uninterrupted, crystal pathways.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing the superstructure of Image B, it shows angular, faceted elements suggesting a crystalline transformation. However, evaluating the clarity of the edges and structural integrity, certain sections appear warped or lacking in correct proportion, indicating potential digital imperfections or collapse in geometry. Such details detract from the ideal angular crystalline form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to commonly accepted minimalistic photography, the background retains distant islands rather than presenting a minimalistic horizon. The transition between the water and sky appears natural with no evident breaks or mismatches in brightness. While softening might have been applied, the level of minimalism is insufficient due to the presence of visible islands, indicating the background is not adjusted extensively in minimalistic style.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the ship as securely positioned on the water's surface, showing no signs of floating or base misalignment. Its scale appears proper in relation to the visible elements like water and horizon, following the expected real-world physics. The ship blends naturally with its environment, fulfilling spatial and positional demands for authenticity and proportion.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon visual analysis of Image B, the crystalline surfaces show a diversity in texture without noticeable repetitions. However, scrutiny might reveal instances of blurred edges or artifact-like effects hinting at digital processing flaws, undermining the facade of flawless synthesis. As some blurring and digital artifacts are present, the expectation of entirely clean crystal surfaces is unmet.",
