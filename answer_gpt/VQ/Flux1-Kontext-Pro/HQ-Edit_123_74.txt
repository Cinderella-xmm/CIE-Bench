    "Question": "Q1: Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet on the snowboarder's head appears coherent and realistically placed. The proportions are consistent with those of a snowboarding helmet designed to offer protection, and there are no visible deformations or unnatural edges. The helmet integrates seamlessly with the snowboarder's attire and posture, suggesting an intentional and precise enlargement rather than an accidental distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",
    "explanation": "Examination of Image B shows both hands of the snowboarder with five fingers each. The fingers have natural joint alignment, exhibiting a realistic shape typical of human anatomy. There are no extra digits, distortions, or signs of stretching that would suggest any alterations from a natural hand shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red tones on the snowboarder's snowsuit are vivid and contribute to the bright, dynamic appearance suitable for snowboarding attire. The texture corresponds well with what would be expected from fabric, capturing the balance between vibrant color and realistic material without exhibiting excess glossiness, pixelation, or disconnection from a textile appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a stylized representation of snow and tree outlines that are cleanly separated and resemble layered paper cut shapes. The visual style does not show gaps or overlapping distortions; the elements are distinct and appear intentionally arranged, without floating fragments disrupting the landscape.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the snowboarder's body posture aligned with the direction of the snowboard, showing balanced weight distribution and no floating limbs or impossible angles?",
    "explanation": "The posture of the snowboarder in Image B is dynamically aligned with the direction of the snowboard, suggesting realistic engagement with the slope, which is crucial for balance and performance in snowboarding. The limbs are positioned in a way that depicts balanced weight distribution, with no limbs appearing to float independently or being set at impossible angles, indicating the artist's attention to realistic physical dynamics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
