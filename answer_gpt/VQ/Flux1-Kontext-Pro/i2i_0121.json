    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character maintain its structural consistency as a chibi version, with no disproportionate or overly exaggerated body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits the classic features of a chibi design, characterized by a larger head on a smaller body with simplified details. This style choice inherently involves some exaggeration, but it is consistent with the typical chibi form and does not feature disproportionately large or small body parts compared to what is usually seen in chibi figures.",

      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base seamlessly integrated with the keychain, avoiding any evident artifacts or unnatural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character standing on a base that appears consistent and well-integrated with the overall design of the keychain. There are no visible seams or mismatches that would suggest an artificial or awkward connection between the character and the base.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the character's facial features retained their distinctiveness in chibi form, without losing important details such as eye shape and mouth expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred in Image B, assuming the rest of the character maintains chibi stylistic standards, the facial features typical in such styles, like large expressive eyes and a simple mouth, are likely preserved. The focus is generally on retaining cuteness and expressiveness, which are crucial to the chibi aesthetic.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character appear naturally positioned on the shell-shaped base, with a logical and stable stance, avoiding any awkward angles or impossible positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character stands on a base in a stable and centered stance, which suggests a well-planned and executed design. There are no signs of imbalance, such as leaning or seemingly floating, which ensures a natural presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the character, including clothing and skin, as well as the shell-shaped base, look natural and cohesive, avoiding any incongruent or artificial surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the character with materials that are consistent and coherent with typical chibi figurine designs. The clothing and skin appear to have uniform textures and colors, which are suitable for the intended aesthetic of a keychain. The base complements the keychain without any jarring differences in texture or style.",
