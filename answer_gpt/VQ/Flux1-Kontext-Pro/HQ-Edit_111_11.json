      "question": "Does the fedora hat sit naturally on the man's head without visible misalignment, unnatural shadows, or clipping artifacts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fedora hat on the man's head appears accurately positioned without any visible misalignment. The lighting and shadows look natural, with no observable artifacts at the edges.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bowtie is neatly positioned under the man's collar, with fabric folds appearing natural and consistent with the physics of fabric tension and gravity.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall decorations display clear geometric patterns characteristic of art deco design, consistent with the era featured.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both hands holding the saxophone feature five fingers each, with natural positioning and noticeable knuckles. There are no signs of deformation, extra digits, or inaccuracies in hand anatomy. This suggests meticulous rendering of the hands to appear lifelike and anatomically correct.",
