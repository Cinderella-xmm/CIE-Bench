        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are rendered in a chibi-style with smooth, rounded textures typical of 3D cartoon characters. The details such as the clothing, shoes, and expressions are clear and without pixelation or blurring. These characteristics contribute to a consistent and artifact-free appearance, which is supported by the advanced rendering techniques used in creating 3D models.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters in Image B wear bright and colorful winter outfits appropriate for a festive scene.
