      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally, with no distorted shapes such as stretched eyelids or misshapen lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the face is blurred, therefore, the eyes, nose, and mouth cannot be assessed for symmetry or proportional alignment. Without this assessment, determining the presence of any distortions is not possible. Consequently, this question cannot be answered given the limitation of the blurred area.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camera proportionally enlarged but still held securely by both hands without floating or unnatural grip angles, and do the metallic accents show consistent highlights and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera is depicted as being held by both hands. The artist has rendered it to appear proportional and well-gripped, indicating no floating or unnatural angles. The metallic accents are depicted as stylistically consistent with the illustration style, maintaining visual coherence without real-life reflections due to the nature of the drawing. Compared to Image A, where the camera is a physical object, Image B captures the essence without externally inconsistent reflections.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the background gradient blend seamlessly with the subject’s edges, with no visible haloing, sharp cutoffs, or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background gradient in Image B transitions smoothly into the subject’s edge, maintaining a clean separation without halos or sharp cutoffs. The painted style ensures there’s no visible color bleeding, unlike the photograph in Image A, which naturally lacks these artistic edits while maintaining realistic depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the decorative border composed of clean, continuous camera motifs that do not intersect with the subject’s face or clothing, and are there no pixelated or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a decorative border with camera motifs that are continuous and clearly defined, adding an illustrative style to the image. These motifs frame the subject perfectly and do not intrude on the face or clothing. The lines within the border are clean with no apparent pixelation or breaks, emphasizing a well-executed design. In Image A, such a border does not exist as it is a straightforward photograph.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are individual hair strands, denim stitching, and fabric folds clearly visible and undistorted, with no smoothing or blurring that removes detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being an illustration, simplifies and stylizes the elements of hair, denim stitching, and fabric folds. While individual strands and stitches are not marked by realism seen in Image A, the drawing effectively captures a stylized detail that remains coherent within its artistic constraints. The fabric folds are represented smoothly without blur, indicative of the illustrator's intent rather than realistic texture.",
