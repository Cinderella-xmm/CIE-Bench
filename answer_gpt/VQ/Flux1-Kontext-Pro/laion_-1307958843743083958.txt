    "Question": "Q1: Are the gold-finished surfaces of both cheetah figures smooth, reflective, and free of unnatural textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures have gold finishes that appear smooth and reflective, consistent with metallic surfaces. They do not show any signs of digital artifacting such as unnatural textures or patches, suggesting a high-quality edit. This is inferred from the even and shiny appearance of the gold material, which is typical of polished metal surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the translucent green-tinted glass façade maintain clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission without visible distortion or abrupt transitions at its boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass façade is translucent with a green tint and exhibits clean, continuous edges. It demonstrates realistic light transmission, as the glass reflects and refracts light naturally without visible distortion or abrupt transitions. This observation relies on the uniformity and clarity of the glass's appearance, suggesting a high level of detailing in the edit.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the text 'Savanna Essence' clearly visible, correctly positioned on the base, and rendered with sharp edges and consistent font style without blurring or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Savanna Essence' appears clearly visible and is correctly positioned on the base of the left cheetah figure. The font style is consistent, with sharp edges and no blurring or misalignment. This is determined by the clear visibility and uniformity of the text, indicating precision in the digital rendering or editing process.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the transformed cheetah figures maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions, with no visible elongation, compression, or deformation of limbs or torso?",
    "explanation": "The cheetah figures in Image B retain a sitting posture typical of cheetahs, maintaining proportional limbs and torsos without visible elongation, compression, or deformation. This is inferred from the natural alignment and proportionate structure of the figures, indicating that the editing process preserved the original anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the two golden cheetah-bottle figures symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade, and do they cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two golden cheetah figures are symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade. They cast consistent shadows that correlate with the ambient lighting direction, reflecting appropriately on the surface. This symmetry and shadow casting are observed from the careful placement and lighting effects, indicating alignment with natural light logic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
