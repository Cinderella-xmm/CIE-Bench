    "Question": "Q2: Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows human figures scaled down to pewter models under the dome. Upon examining the hands and limbs, they appear normal with correct proportions (fingers not exceeding five), and the postures of the figures appear natural.

    "Question": "Q4: Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts trees under the dome that maintain natural branch structures, and the material appears to be a glass-like substance, suggesting transparent and refractive qualities. The outlines are smooth without jagged edges, and the coloration remains natural, consistent with the material's properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"
