      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain of the dog appear naturally integrated into the image without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style keychain is held by an actual hand, which contributes to its integration into the scene. The colors of the keychain are vibrant and consistent, and there are no visible artifacts or jagged edges around the keychain that would suggest it is artificially placed into the image. The textures appear smooth and fitting for a keychain, not showing any digital editing marks or inconsistencies with common physical textures of similar merchandise. Thus, it appears naturally integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style keychain consistent with the hand holding it, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain's proportions are carefully crafted to fit within the natural grip of an average hand. There is a smooth flow of lines and shapes, and no uneven bulges or indentations are present. The dimensions align well with typical merchandise size expectations, maintaining consistency with how an actual keychain would be held. Therefore, the proportions and physical rationality appear appropriate.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style keychain accurately depict the dog's essential features and characteristics from the original image, maintaining visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a chibi-style representation of a dog. A chibi figure typically exaggerates certain features like eyes, but aims to capture essential characteristics. The keychain in Image B maintains features such as long fur, floppy ears, and a basic color scheme that relate back to the dog in Image A. Despite the stylistic difference, it holds resemblance to the original's essential features. Given the chibi styling context, it maintains enough of the dog's notable traits for visual credibility.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the chibi-style keychain preserved and look natural, without any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B is designed with smooth, rounded edges typical of plastic or rubber material, common for keychain manufacturing. The texture looks uniformly soft without appearing pixelated or rough. The shading and color gradients create a realistic plastic appearance, and there is no evident loss of detail that would detract from its authenticity as a product. Thus, the textures and details appear natural.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the connection between the chibi-style keychain and the tiny silver keyring appear natural and physically plausible, without any structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keyring's small metal loop is securely attached to the keychain's top part, aligning with common designs that offer durability and stability. The silver color of the keyring nicely contrasts against the keychain and matches conventional metallic hues in keychain production. There are no noticeable gaps or unnatural bends in the metal, suggesting a natural and physically plausible connection.",
