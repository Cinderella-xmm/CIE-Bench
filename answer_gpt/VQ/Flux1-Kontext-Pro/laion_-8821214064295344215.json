      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic tiles appear to be consistently arranged on the teddy bears. Each tile is of similar size, and they are aligned properly without notable gaps or misalignments. This gives a uniform and professional mosaic pattern that covers both teddy bears completely, indicating careful attention to the mosaic craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic tiles on the yellow and turquoise sweaters of the teddy bears follow the original shape and contours of the garments closely. The tiles are applied in such a way that they maintain the intended patterns and do not appear to warp or break any geometric shapes. This indicates a precise application that respects the original design.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth are constructed using shaded tiles that are distinct and proportionally correct. There is no blurring or misalignment; the tiles are positioned accurately allowing clear recognition of the bears' faces. This careful tile placement ensures that the expressions and features are conveyed correctly.",

      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bows retain their original shape and the tiles used for them are arranged to give a sense of smoothness and slight reflectivity, mimicking the fabric of the original bows. This creates a natural contrast against the tiled ‘fur’ of the teddy bears, indicating attention to detail in maintaining the differentiation in texture.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the white pedestal is clearly depicted as being fully grounded beneath the bears without any floating effects or visible gaps. The pedestal has clean edges and maintains a uniform color, with no blending issues present. The pedestal looks solid and distinct from the bears, ensuring that it supports them visually and structurally.",
