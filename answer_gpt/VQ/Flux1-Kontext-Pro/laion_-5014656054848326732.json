      "question": "Is the entire image rendered in a consistent sepia tone, with no areas retaining original color or showing abrupt transitions between color spaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image shows a consistent sepia tone throughout, which is typical of old photographs and illustrations. This uniform coloration creates a vintage feel. The entire scene, including the figure, book, and background, stays within this color scheme without any regions appearing to break this tone. Therefore, the image displays a harmonious and consistent sepia effect.",

      "question": "Does the leather-bound book appear physically plausible in size and placement on the desk, with visible textures such as leather surface and binding details that match the style of the era?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book appears to fit naturally on the desk with a size that is proportionate to the man's hands and writing task. Given the vintage style of the depiction, such books were typically larger with noticeable binding. However, due to the illustration style, the precise leather texture may not be overtly visible, but it does appear consistent with the artistic approach of the era. Thus, it maintains physical plausibility in the scene.",

      "question": "Is the quill positioned naturally in the man's mouth, with correct orientation and feather detail, and does it avoid deformation or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no quill positioned in the man's mouth; rather, it is depicted in his hand for writing on the book. Quills in hand are consistent with the era portrayed. The depiction shows typical feather detail expected in artwork of this nature. The orientation and positioning appear natural and appropriate for writing, avoiding any signs of deformation.",

      "question": "Does the frock coat show proper folds and tailoring consistent with human anatomy, and does it overlay the shirt and suspenders without clipping or unnatural layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frock coat is rendered with folds and creases typical of the fabric depicted. The portrayal shows the coat is neatly tailored to fit the man, overlaying in a manner consistent with period-appropriate fashion. There is no indication of clipping or unnatural layering, which suggests a realistic depiction of clothing as it would naturally fall over the body and underlying garments.",

      "question": "Is the high-back chair correctly positioned behind the man, with proper alignment to his body and the table, and does it feature detailed carvings or patterns typical of Victorian design without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is positioned naturally behind the seated man, aligning correctly in relation to the table and his posture. The artwork style simplifies certain details, yet maintains enough features to suggest Victorian design elements such as high back and curved edges without any apparent geometric distortion.",

      "question": "Are the floral motifs evenly placed around the figure and background, maintaining consistent line quality and style, and do they avoid overlapping critical elements such as the face or hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and vine-like decorative motifs are placed around the border of the image, framing the figure without interfering with the central elements such as the hands or torso. The line quality is consistent throughout these patterns, which adds to the illustrationâ€™s ornamental design without distracting from the main subject matter.",
