    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel curls integrated into the hairline without distorting the shape of the head or breaking the continuity of the scalp surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogwheel curls appear to be seamlessly integrated into the hairline, offering continuity and maintaining the shape of the head without disruption. The placement and design visually align with realistic curly hair without breaking the smooth transitions expected in a human scalp. Visual cues display harmony within the hair structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic fabric folds follow the natural contours of the shoulders and chest without unnatural stretching or buckling, and are the rivets and tubes placed in physically plausible locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic fabric in Image B follows the natural contours of the shoulders and chest, with no observable unnatural stretching or buckling. Rivets and tubes appear to be strategically placed in locations that are plausible, considering structural support and aesthetic enhancements typical of such designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the watch parts and gears attached to the base in a stable and symmetrical arrangement without overlapping or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents watch parts and gears that are symmetrically arranged and seem attached to the base in a manner that upholds physical logic. No floating or overlapping elements are detected, indicating a stable and orderly configuration conducive to realistic structural integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the monocle mechanism positioned flush with the eye socket and connected to the face via visible but plausible mechanical joints, without altering the shape of the surrounding facial bones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocle mechanism appears to be positioned flush with the presumed eye socket area. It seems to employ visible mechanical joints for support, which maintain plausibility without obvious alterations to the structurally sensitive facial bones. The integration suggests mechanical plausibility while visually preserving the natural form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bronze and copper tones uniformly applied across all modified elements, with realistic reflections and no abrupt color boundaries or flat, non-metallic areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze and copper tones in Image B are uniformly applied across the visible elements of the sculpture. These tones reflect realistically, mimicking true metal reflections, without abrupt color changes or flat, non-metallic sections. The consistency affirms a coherent chromatic application.",
