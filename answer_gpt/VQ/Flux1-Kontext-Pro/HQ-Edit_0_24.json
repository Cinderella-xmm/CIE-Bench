      "question": "Do the enhanced flowers exhibit vivid but natural color gradients and soft, detailed textures without visible artifacts like oversharpening or color smearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowers in Image B present rich and vibrant color gradients that smoothly transition from one hue to another, suggesting a natural coloration typical in real flowers. The soft textures of the petals indicate attention to detail, avoiding digital oversharpening, which would result in harsh edges or a stark appearance. The absence of color smearing, which would show as overlapping colors lacking definition, affirms the quality of the enhancements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the shovel and watering can visually consistent with antique metal objects, showing realistic surface textures like tarnish and reflections without unnatural gloss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shovel and watering can in Image B resemble antique metal objects with realistic surface textures. The tarnish and reflections are depicted with subtlety, capturing the aging process metals undergo, without exhibiting unnatural gloss that would suggest unrealistic shine or digital artifacts. There is no visible distortion, maintaining the coherence of their shapes.",

      "question": "Is the vine motif background subtly integrated into the image without obscuring primary elements or causing visible layering artifacts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine motif in Image B is seamlessly incorporated along the edges, adding an aesthetic enhancement without obstructing key image elements like the woman or garden. The integration does not exhibit layering artifacts, which would manifest as a visual separation between added motifs and original elements, preserving the picturesque quality of the garden image.",

      "question": "Does the ornate leafy frame around the blank header have smooth, continuous shapes with natural leaf contours and consistent lighting, without geometric distortions or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate leafy frame in Image B maintains smooth, continuous shapes that mimic the natural contours associated with leaves, suggesting attention to detailed design. The lighting across the frame is consistent, with no signs of geometric distortion such as irregular or skewed shapes, and no clipping implies that the frame is intact and coherent throughout.",
