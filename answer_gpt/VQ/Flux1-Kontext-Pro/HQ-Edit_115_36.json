      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the golden title banner positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting the cat’s head or the window frame, and does it have a natural metallic sheen that matches the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner 'Solara the Watcher' is positioned clearly at the top center. It does not overlap or distort the cat’s head or the window frame, indicating careful placement. A metallic sheen is visible that harmonizes with the lighting in the scene, suggesting it was designed to match the ambient light effectively. Therefore, the positioning and design coherence support a positive evaluation of these features.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style where the cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all exhibit smooth textures and no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a semi-realistic 3D style, with the cat’s fur being detailed and smoothly textured, similar in quality to those of the window frame and added elements like the title banner and stat bars. The entire composition shows attention to detail without presenting pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions, contributing to a cohesive visual experience.",
