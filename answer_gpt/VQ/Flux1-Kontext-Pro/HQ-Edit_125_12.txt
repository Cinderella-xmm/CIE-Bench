    "Question": "Q1: Does the marble texture beneath the teapot exhibit natural veining and color variation without abrupt edges or artificial patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the marble surface visible beneath the teapot has veins that are characteristic of natural marble, with smooth and flowing lines as well as consistent color variation. The veining appears organic, without any sharp or jagged edges that might suggest an artificial or digitally edited pattern. This natural look suggests a real marble design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the transparent label positioned on the teapot’s body with uniform opacity and no visible pixelation or ghosting around the text edges?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, there doesn't seem to be a visible transparent label on the teapot at all. The teapot in the image shows intricate engravings, and there is no indication of any label with text visible that would show issues with pixelation or ghosting around its edges. The observation seems to focus more on the object’s metallic engraved design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the gold monogram on the lid align with the surrounding engravings in terms of depth, shadow, and metallic finish, without appearing raised or detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there does not appear to be a distinct gold monogram on the lid of the teapot. The lid is consistent with the rest of the teapot's design characterized by its intricate silver engravings. There is no section of the lid that appears out of place or different in terms of texture or finish from the rest of the teapot, maintaining the same metallic finish and depth.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the box positioned adjacent to the teapot with correct perspective and scale, and does it feature consistent engraving patterns and material appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the perspective and scale of the box positioned next to the teapot appear authentic and well-proportioned. The boxes are larger than the teapot, as expected for packaging, and they possess a detailed marble-like texture with similar design attributes. However, the boxes themselves don't feature engraving patterns akin to the teapot's metallic engravings, implying that the 'consistent engraving pattern' is not applicable in this context.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the shadows cast by the teapot and box consistent with the light source direction and do they match the ambient lighting of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by both the teapot and the boxes appear on the surface consistent with the light source, which seems to come from above and slightly from the left. The shadows are soft and diffuse, matching the ambient lighting conditions, lending a realistic appearance to the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
