      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where the mirror was has been replaced with a landscape canvas wall art. The texture visible in the artwork area suggests a fabric canvas, characterized by the subtle detailing and matte finish, consistent with typical wall art found in minimalist designs. The detail and texture indicate that it is made from canvas or a similar fabric, which aids in maintaining a minimalist style through its simplicity and unobtrusiveness.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the landscape wall art fits harmoniously within the space between the lamps and above the sink, its rectangular shape is geometrically coherent with the surrounding fixtures and tiles. This ensures structural coherence is preserved, and no awkward or disproportionate spacing is observed, maintaining the visual balance achieved by the original mirror setup.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the wall art seems free of unnatural textures or digital artifacts. The presence of subtle texture in the art piece, resembling fabric canvas, indicates a natural, high-quality representation without indication of distortions or editing errors commonly appearing as pixelation or color aberrations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color scheme of the minimalist landscape wall art, featuring muted greens, browns, and greys, complements the natural tones of the bathroom, combining with the white marble tiles and brown wooden vanity to establish a balanced and coherent aesthetic. The overall harmony in color and style suggests the art does not clash visually with surrounding elements, preventing it from appearing out of place.",
