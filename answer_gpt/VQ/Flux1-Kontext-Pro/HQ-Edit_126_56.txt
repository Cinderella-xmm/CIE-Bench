    "Question": "Q1: Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are depicted as sharp, triangular shapes with clear lines and consistent geometrical features. They are painted with smooth, diagonal strokes that make the peaks appear solid with defined edges. In comparison, Image A shows the mountains with more realistic shading and less defined edges, creating a more natural appearance with variable textures. The simplified forms in Image B highlight their geometric consistency, devoid of distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays trees with characteristic triangular silhouettes, void of fragmented or irregular branches, each maintaining uniform geometric proportions against the landscape. The design adheres to a stylized approach where the tree shapes are simplified but clearly recognizable. Compared to Image A, where trees are rendered with more natural, detailed leaves and variably shaped branches, Image B prioritizes geometric consistency and smooth outlines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "The river in Image B features parallel lines that consistently follow the directional flow of the water, enhancing its visual continuity. The spacing between these lines is uniform, creating a harmonious reflection of light across the water surface. This is distinct from Image A, where the reflections lack structured parallel lines, focusing instead on a more natural ripple effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

```json
{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the river mirrors the elements above it, such as trees and mountains, with almost perfect symmetry. The shapes and positions are consistent with what is above the water surface, contributing to the image's visual harmony. In contrast, Image A shows reflections with less symmetry due to the detailed natural textures mirroring more realistically.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The color block boundaries in Image B are depicted with crisp and clean edges, maintaining the integrity of geometric shapes like trees and mountain peaks. These edges are smooth, without any feathering, blurring, or pixelation, which contrasts with Image A where the blending techniques create softer transitions between colors and shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
