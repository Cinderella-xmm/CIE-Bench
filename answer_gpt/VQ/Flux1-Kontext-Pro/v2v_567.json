      "question": "Are the textures on the 3D chibi-style characters smooth and consistent with the rest of the image, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the chibi-style characters appear smooth, which is typical for stylized characters. This stylistic choice blends them closely with the edited photo's overall look without introducing visible artifacts that would make them stand out unnaturally against the backdrop.",

      "question": "Does the train and station backdrop maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without any distortions or unnatural alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the train and station backdrop maintaining realistic structural integrity and appearance. There is no evident distortion in the physical features of the station house or the train; they match expected proportions and angles seen in historical imagery. Given the typical visual cues, the editing preserves consistency without introducing any unrealistic alterations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style characters retain their original positions, outfits, and postures accurately, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters retain positions similar to those in Image A, with no substantial distortions or deformities in their outfits and postures. This speaks to a careful preservation in transferring their positions and clothing styles, consistent with a chibi aesthetic, hence maintaining their original placement, posture, and costume design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the characters' clothing and accessories preserved in the 3D chibi-style characters, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the finer textures typical of fabric detail in clothing might be subdued due to the chibi styling, the level of detail in outfits and accessories appears to be adequately preserved considering their stylization. Stylized characters often balance simplicity with reasonable detail, and Image B executes this by ensuring clothing details remain discernible despite their cartoon-like textures, without unnatural modification.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the 3D chibi-style characters within the scene contribute to a visually credible and natural appearance, without disrupting the overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B integrates the chibi-style characters into the scene in a way that reflects a maintained spatial harmony and visual credibility. The proportions and interactions between characters and the setting replicate a plausible layout. Despite their stylized appearance, their placement doesn't disrupt the overall composition, giving the scene coherence without degrading authenticity.",
