      "question": "Are the textures of the ceramic mosaic tiles smooth and consistent without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the map and pins appear similar to a real-life physical map rather than mosaic tiles. The textures appear smooth and printed, as one would expect from a standard paper map, with no visible indication of individual tiles or the grouted lines that characterize ceramic mosaics. There are no artifacts typically seen in handmade tile pieces, suggesting smooth consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the map and pins maintain their integrity without distortion in the ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the map and pins have clean, well-defined shapes that retain their geometric integrity. The details are precise, with lines on the map and contours on the pins maintaining clarity, suggesting that if this were made of tiles, they would not exhibit any distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the colors of the ceramic mosaic tiles bold and harmonious, reflecting the original map's visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, colors are consistent with what one would expect from a printed map. They are bold enough to differentiate various features like boundaries and pins, displaying harmony typical of printed media. Instead of reflective tile glazes, the colors appear flat and printed, which aligns with map visuals.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the map and pins been preserved in the ceramic mosaic tile artwork without significant loss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains fine details such as writing, lines, and the precise shapes of the pins, showcasing a high level of detail one would expect from a printed map. No detail seems lost, which would typically highlight the challenges of replicating fine writing or small map details in mosaic artistry.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand appear natural and undistorted while interacting with the ceramic mosaic tile artwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand appears realistic and well-integrated into the scene. No distortion or unnatural angles are evident, and the skin texture and positioning are consistent with a real hand arranging map pins. This natural appearance indicates the hand's portrayal would be considered natural within the context of map artwork.",
