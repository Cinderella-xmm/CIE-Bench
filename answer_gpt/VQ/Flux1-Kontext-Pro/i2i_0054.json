      "question": "Does the newly added matte gray background appear uniform and free of any distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the background is a matte gray color, which appears consistent and even across the entire scene. There are no visible signs of distortion, such as patches of different shades, nor are there any unnatural textures. The uniformity of the background can be assessed by its smoothness and its consistent tone throughout the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the absence of shadows make the elephant appear unnaturally floating or disconnected from the surface beneath it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is shown without any noticeable shadows, which are typically cast by objects resting on a surface. Shadows help in grounding objects, providing a visual cue that indicates contact with a surface. Without these shadows, the elephant might seem to be floating or disconnected from the surface it's supposed to stand on. This absence results in a lack of depth perception, making the elephant appear as if it's not properly anchored.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fine details and textures on the elephant's skin preserved without noticeable loss after the background change?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When inspecting Image B, the elephant's skin retains the detailed texture and wrinkles characteristic of an elephant. These details are important for visual realism and recognition of the animal. There is no indication that these textures have been altered or lost due to the change in background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the absence of banana shape and metal stand curves, which were not part of the original elephant image, result in any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any unnatural artifacts or inconsistencies that can be linked to missing elements like banana shapes or metal stand curves, which were not present in the original image of the elephant. The image appears consistent, and nothing seems out of place, suggesting that these elements would not have caused discrepancies if present.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain its correct proportions and physical rationality relative to the new matte gray background, avoiding any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant maintains proportions that are consistent with what is expected of an elephant of this type and size. The new matte gray background does not affect the appearance of the elephant's shape or size. Despite the background being changed, the figure's proportions remain correct and visually rational.",
