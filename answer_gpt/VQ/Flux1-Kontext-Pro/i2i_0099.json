      "question": "Does the mug maintain its structural integrity and geometric shape after being converted into an oil painting, without appearing distorted or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug retains a consistent geometric shape, similar to its appearance in Image A, but rendered in oil painting style. The proportions and overall form appear intact and do not look distorted or broken. The visual cues suggest that the artistic style did not compromise the structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or obvious artifacts present on the mug or coffee surface after the style conversion to an oil painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the style conversion introduces typical oil painting brush strokes and textures, which are expected in such artistic renditions. These textures are consistent throughout the mug and coffee surface, indicating they are part of the artistic representation rather than artifacts. There are no standout unnatural textures that appear out of place for an oil painting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the mug and its surroundings remain visually credible and consistent with an oil painting style, without looking out of place or overly artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows around the mug and its surroundings maintain a cohesive appearance typical of an oil painting. The way light is depicted follows typical artistic norms for such a style, not appearing overly artificial or inconsistent. The shadows cast on the coaster and colored surfaces align realistically in the context of oil painting.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials of the mug and the coaster still look natural and appropriate for an oil painting, without showing any signs of unnatural blending or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rendering of materials such as the ceramic-like appearance of the mug and the more lifelike texture of the coaster seems appropriate within the context of an oil painting. The blending and texture do appear more stylized, consistent with oil paint, yet they do not show unnatural blending or inconsistency for this art form.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the mug handle and its reflections been preserved clearly, without any significant loss of detail or degradation in the oil painting conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the mug handle retains definition appropriate for an oil painting rendition. While fine reflective details are less pronounced compared to Image A, due to the typical characteristics of oil paint style, key outlines and necessary structure are preserved. This preservation aligns with an expected artistic interpretation, without sharp losses in detail.",
