      "question": "Does the anime-style conversion of the athlete retain the original pose structure without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the athlete is depicted in a crouched position similar to Image A. The edited image converted to an anime-style still retains the natural curve and angles of the body similar to the original photograph without introducing distortions as is common for exaggerated anime poses.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced facial expressions (focused eyes and light effects) integrated seamlessly into the athlete's face and do not appear as unnatural overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, light effects and facial expressions appear enhanced and stylized. While facial expressions are difficult to assess directly due to blurring, light effects around the face are stylized yet maintained without appearing as overlays that disrupt the natural form common in anime styles.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the added background energy glow contribute positively to the atmosphere without causing unnatural lighting or breaking the scene's visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added glow provides a heightened dramatic effect consistent with anime styles which often emphasize action and highlight elements. The glow enhances the figure's presence against the tennis court background without causing discord in visual coherence.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image maintains the realistic proportions of the athlete's limbs and the tennis racket, avoiding the exaggerated limb sizes sometimes seen in anime representations. The enhancements focus more on the surface details and lighting rather than altering physical attributes.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image retains the athlete in the context of a tennis match, with enhancements that highlight the athlete's energy and presence without sacrificing clarity. Although stylized, the image retains the fundamental aspects of a tennis match setting, successfully converting it into an anime-style without losing its essence.",
