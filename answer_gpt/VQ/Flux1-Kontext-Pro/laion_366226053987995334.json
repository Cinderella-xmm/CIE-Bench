      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feather earrings have been anthropomorphized with eyes and a mouth added. The facial features are clearly visible and placed on the black oval area. They are proportionally sized relative to the earrings and fit within the design without distorting the engraved lines or creating any odd texture contrasts. The features appear to be well-integrated into the feather surface while maintaining the natural depiction of the feather patterns.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the central black oval stone on each feather preserved and unobscured by the added facial features, and do the engraved lines of the feather remain symmetrical and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the central black oval stone is the area where facial elements are positioned. The integration of facial features on this area retains its visibility and does not obstruct or distort the black stone shape itself. The engraved feather lines remain mostly symmetrical and undisturbed, indicating that the addition did not negatively impact the overall symmetry and design integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there a visible and logically connected arm-like extension from one earring to the other, suggesting motion, and are both earrings still properly attached to their hooks without floating or detachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the comic portion of Image B, the earrings are animated with arm-like extensions connecting them, suggesting interaction and motion. These appendages do not alter the attachment of the earrings to the hooks; they remain connected properly without any floating or unsuspended appearance. This clever portrayal enhances the narrative while respecting the physical realism of the earrings remaining attached.",

      "question": "Is the text bubble positioned near the head of the anthropomorphic earring, clearly legible, and free from overlapping or covering essential details of the earrings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubble is positioned above and near the head of the anthropomorphic earring, in line with the direction of the dialogue. It is clearly legible and does not overlap or obscure any essential details of the earrings, allowing for both the comic dialogue and design elements to coexist harmoniously.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the exact contours of the earrings without gaps or misalignment, and are the vibrant colors applied consistently without pixelation, blurring, or loss of fine engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines precisely trace the contours of the earrings, ensuring no gaps or misalignments. The colors are uniformly applied with consistent tones, maintaining clarity and crispness without any pixelation or blurring. Fine engraved details remain intact, highlighting the precision of the modifications and maintaining the integrity of the portrayal.",
