      "question": "Are the edges of the chibi-style 3D models seamlessly integrated with the photorealistic background without visible artifacts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style 3D models are placed against a photorealistic background of a lush oasis. Typically, if the integration is done well, the edges of the 3D models would not show any visible seams or artifacts when transitioning into the background. Upon inspection, the edges appear smooth and clean, suggesting a seamless blend with the background.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the blonde-haired character's armor has visible glowing runes.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character holding the orb is dressed in plain adventurer's clothing, which should wrap around the model's body without awkward stretches, compressions, or distortions.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archer character is adorned with leather armor and a floral crown. The leather armor should follow the natural curves and proportions typical of chibi models, and the floral crown should sit naturally on the head.

The border in Image B integrates harmoniously, enhancing the overall composition and framing the scene without causing disruption.",
