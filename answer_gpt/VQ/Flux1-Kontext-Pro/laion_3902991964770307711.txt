    "Question": "Q1: Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra are visually transparent, indicating a glass-like material. The tapering shape and smoothness suggest a crafted design typical of glass caps. The reflection and light behavior on these portions further support the conclusion of a realistic glass appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and central shaft of the candelabra exhibit a consistent gold finish that reflects light uniformly along their surfaces. There are no visible seams or breaks, which aligns with the characteristics of smooth, continuous metal tubing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
    "explanation": "The brand logo on the base of the candelabra in Image B is delicately embossed in a manner that suggests integration with the metal surface. The lighting is consistent with the surrounding area, indicating no depth anomalies or irregular shadows, which contributes to a natural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral-engraved patterns appear to be consistently distributed around the candelabra's contours. They follow the shape of the structure without appearing flat or artificially repeated. These patterns are likely engraved rather than overlaid, given the realistic appearance they present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
    "explanation": "The script font label on the central tube of the candelabra in Image B adheres naturally to the tube's curvature. It maintains proportional integrity without signs of warping or stretching. The label does not intrude upon or overlap with other details, indicating a precise alignment with the surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
