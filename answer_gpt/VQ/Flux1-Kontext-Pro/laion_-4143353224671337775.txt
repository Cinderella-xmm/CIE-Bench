    "Question": "Q1: Are the beige and brown puzzle pieces uniformly aligned and interlocked across the surface of the sculpture without visible gaps, misalignments, or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the sculpture showcases lines and textures that mimic the appearance of puzzle pieces. They appear to be well-aligned with each other, showing precise interlocking with no gaps or misalignments. This suggests a uniformity across the puzzle pieces, as there are no visible irregular edges or disruptions that might indicate poor alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the edges of the puzzle pieces follow the natural curvature of the original ceramic head shape without abrupt angular deviations or unnatural flattening?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the puzzle pieces appear to be designed to fit the rounded form of the sculpture seamlessly. The curvature of these edges respects the natural shape of the ceramic, without presenting any angular or flattened disruptions that would suggest deviations from the original form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the green puzzle fragment on the top of the head smooth and free of rough textures, cracks, or color variations that contrast with the surrounding beige and brown puzzle pieces?",
    "explanation": "The green area on top of the sculpture in Image B seems consistent in texture and integrates smoothly with the rest of the beige and brown puzzle design. There are no apparent cracks or rough textures, and the color variation does not stand out in a way that seems out of place or conflicting with adjacent pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the sculpture placed horizontally on the white shelf with stable contact and no floating or tilting effects, maintaining a natural shadow and perspective?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is displayed on a white shelf. It is positioned horizontally with stable contact, as evidenced by the consistent shadow underneath and the lack of any visible tilting or floating effects. The perspective appears natural, suggesting it rests securely on the shelf.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial features (eyes, eyebrows, mouth, ears) clearly preserved in shape and proportion despite being integrated into the puzzle piece design, without deformation or blurring?",
    "explanation": "From Image B, it is evident that the facial features such as eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and ears are clearly defined and maintain their proportional relationships. The design integrates these features well with the overall puzzle piece aesthetic, and there is no noticeable blurring or deformations that compromise their recognizability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
