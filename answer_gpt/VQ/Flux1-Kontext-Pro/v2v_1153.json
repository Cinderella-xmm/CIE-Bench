      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features buildings with a traditional Japanese architectural style, characterized by wooden textures and tiled roofs. These elements give the buildings a classic appearance rather than a smooth, metallic texture. Additionally, upon close examination, there is no visible pixelation or blurring that suggests a digital alteration to a metallic texture. Therefore, the appearance remains consistent with its traditional form.",
