      "question": "Is the lens area transformed into eyes with smooth, symmetrical shapes and natural-looking reflections, without jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens area does not show a transformation into eyes. It retains the appearance of a camera lens, maintaining a circular shape with reflections typical of lenses, not resembling eyes in any artistic sense. My analysis stems from observing the lens directly, noting its preservation of camera-like elements rather than eye-like features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the buttons on top of the camera reshaped into brows with preserved circular and rectangular outlines, without deformation or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buttons on the top of the camera in Image B appear unchanged in shape or style, condisting exclusively of camera elements rather than artistic interpretations such as brows. My judgment considers the unchanged camera components observed in Image B, specifically noting the lack of reimagining these parts.",

      "question": "Is the explorer’s hat positioned correctly on top of the camera, with consistent lighting and no visible gaps or overlaps with the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's an explorer’s hat convincingly positioned over the camera, illustrated with careful attention to lighting and integration. The lighting appears consistent with the rest of the image, and the hat appears seamlessly and securely attached to the camera's top, avoiding noticeable gaps or overlaps. My analysis considers the harmony between the camera and the hat in design and placement evident from observation.",

      "question": "If any part of the backpack is visible, does it show realistic shadows and attachment to the camera body without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, parts of a backpack are visible on the side, appearing attached to the camera. The shadows around the backpack look realistic, and the backpack aligns with the camera, not floating or misaligned. Analysis stems from reviewing the integration and shadow work in the illustration, ensuring logical attachment perceived visually.",

      "question": "Does the jungle background blend smoothly with the camera’s edges, without visible outlines, pixelation, or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jungle background is depicted to blend well with the camera’s edges. There is no evidence of visible outlines, pixelation, or color bleeding around edges. This conclusion is drawn from assessing the uniformity and the neat integration of the cartoon jungle setting with the camera visually in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tagline “Capture every quest!” in Image B is clearly visible, fitting well within the cartoon theme both stylistically and aesthetically. It is positioned such that it doesn't obscure any crucial camera features, appearing as part of a harmonious design. This analysis involves observing placement, legibility, and thematic consistency visually evident in Image B.",
