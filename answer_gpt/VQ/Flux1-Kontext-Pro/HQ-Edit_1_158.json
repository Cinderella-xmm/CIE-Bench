    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the woman is crafted to resemble a seated figure reading a book. The chair, posture, and positioning were considered to ensure proportional integrity. The recognizable features — such as the presence of arms, legs, and the curvature of the seated posture — are correctly aligned and free from visible distortions, which is consistent with an understanding of proper human anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the woman’s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is within the context of being held correctly by the woman, maintaining proportional consistency with her hands and arms. It appears firmly placed in her grasp, without any visual overlap or clipping into other elements, aligning with logical spatial awareness and ensuring it does not appear to float unnaturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lace additions to the sweater in Image B are visually integrated with the overall knit texture. They appear to be added intentionally and do not showcase abrupt edges, repeated patterns, or inconsistencies in material, reflecting an understanding of textile design and craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the simplified bookshelves maintain coherent shelf structure with aligned edges and realistic spacing between books, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelves appear simplified yet maintain a coherent structure with parallel and aligned edges. The spacing between books is consistent, ensuring they do not float independently or appear misaligned, demonstrating a standard approach to shelving organization.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the antique-gold cardstock background uniformly textured and lit, with no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches that separate it from the central figure and other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardstock background maintains a uniform texture and lighting, contributing to a seamless integration with the central figure and surrounding elements. There are no abrupt edges or lighting discrepancies, indicating a thorough understanding of maintaining consistent visual and design aesthetics.",
