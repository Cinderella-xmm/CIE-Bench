    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) proportionally accurate and anatomically consistent with the original child's face, without any unnatural stretching or warping?",
    "explanation": "The question is about the facial features, which are blurred in the edited image. Hence, determining proportional accuracy and anatomical consistency with the original is not possible. However, based on available visual cues unrelated to the blurred face, the rest of the edited image reflects characteristics of a classic portrait style, which typically aims for anatomical accuracy. The gown, hair, and background indicate careful attention to detail, suggesting the edited facial features would be proportionally accurate as well.",
