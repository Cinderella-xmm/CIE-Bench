      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the hands and arms of both individuals maintain natural proportions and shapes without appearing distorted or having unnatural numbers of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands and arms of both individuals are depicted with correct proportions and shapes. Each arm segment is proportionate and anatomically accurate, and the visible fingers are appropriately positioned and numbered. This indicates careful attention to anatomical detail in the illustration process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the characters' clothes and the grass field preserved naturally without losing detail or creating unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures on the characters' clothes and the grass field appear stylized due to illustration, yet maintain clarity and do not exhibit any unnatural patterns. While the detail level differs from a photo, the visual texture coherence aligns with artistic norms.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the edited image accurately reflect the original sunlight direction, maintaining shadow and highlight placements in a natural manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains consistent lighting direction by illustrating the sunset-like warm glow from the upper left. The shadows on the ground and the highlights on the individuals' bodies correspond with this light source direction, preserving natural shadow placement and lighting effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the positioning and trajectory of the frisbee in mid-air consistent with realistic motion, avoiding any apparent physical inaccuracies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frisbee in Image B is positioned in mid-air with a trajectory that appears natural and consistent with being actively thrown or caught. The positioning supports the typical arc of a frisbee in flight, showing an understanding of physics and motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions and body postures of the characters align naturally with their dynamic poses and the context of playing frisbee, without any exaggerated or inconsistent distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters' body postures depict engagement and movement typical of playing frisbee, with forward stances and extended arms that support the action of catching. Their proportions and poses are harmonious with the activity context.",
