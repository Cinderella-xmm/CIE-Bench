    "Question": "Q3: Is the quill-shaped logo rendered with a raised, metallic gold finish that shows subtle highlights and shadows consistent with embossed foil, without smearing or unnatural sheen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the quill logo on the inside of the desk's lid is crafted with a raised appearance, simulating embossed metallic finishes. The use of shadows and highlights is subtle, providing depth and contributing to a realistic representation of embossed foil. There is no evidence of smearing or unnatural sheen, which would otherwise detract from the authenticity of the metallic look. This suggests that the quill logo effectively emulates a high-end embossed design.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the ink bottle placed stably on the desk surface with proportional size and shape consistent with real glass bottles, and does the spine of the pad show clear, readable etched text without blurring or ghosting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ink bottle sits firmly on the desk, with a size and form matching what one would expect from a real glass bottle of its type. It does not appear oversized or undersized in relation to the desk's other elements. The text on the spine of the pad is visible and seems to be etched with precision, without any signs of blurring or ghosting, ensuring readability. This observation indicates attention to proportionality and detail for both the ink bottle and the text.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the desk, writing pad, quill logo, and ink bottle are all part of a cohesive vintage stationery arrangement. Each element is proportionately designed to fit within the scene, and their spatial alignment indicates they belong together as a unified package. There are no floating or misaligned parts that disrupt the harmony of the image, suggesting that all components have been carefully integrated to maintain visual coherence.",
