      "question": "Do the shrunk vegetables retain their natural texture and fine details without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roasted vegetables on the right side are the focus. The image shows the texture of the roasted vegetables clearly, with browned and slightly crisp edges, which is typical of well-roasted broccoli. The cauliflower on the left also maintains its natural texture with no visible artifacts indicating any digital manipulation. Given these observations, the shrunk vegetables seem to have retained their natural texture and fine details in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the shapes of the shrunk vegetables proportionate and physically plausible, avoiding any unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the vegetables in Image B, the broccoli and cauliflower have maintained shapes that are typical and natural for these vegetables. The pieces are proportionate and similar to what is expected from natural, cut broccoli and cauliflower heads. There is no sign of unnatural distortion, such as irregular warping or disproportionate bulging in the vegetables.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shrinkage preserve the natural colors and material appearance of the vegetables without introducing any artificial tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows natural colorations of roasted broccoli, where the green and florets tips turn brown, indicating roasting. The cauliflower retains its white color with no artificial tones introduced. The colors are consistent with what is expected from these vegetables when baked. There is no sign of artificial tones that would suggest digital editing errors.",

      "question": "Is the spatial arrangement of the shrunk vegetables consistent with the original structure, maintaining visual credibility within the dish?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of broccoli pieces in the dish in Image B appears well-organized, fitting naturally within the space as one would expect for vegetables packed neatly in a baking dish. The pieces do not seem overcrowded or too sparse, which is typical for a well-arranged dish. This placement maintains the visual credibility of a real cooking scene.",

      "question": "Have the edges and geometric shapes of the shrunk vegetables remained intact, avoiding any broken or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the broccoli and cauliflower appear smooth and intact, exhibiting natural leaf contours typical for these vegetables. There aren't any broken edges or jagged lines that suggest unnatural alteration or poor editing. The shapes are complete and consistent with natural vegetable geometry.",
