    "Question": "Q1: Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brocade gown exhibits realistic folds and volume, particularly in the puffy sleeves and skirt. The fabric drapes naturally over the body and spreads out on the ground as expected. There are no visible distortions or unnatural flat stretches of the fabric, which aligns with how a brocade gown typically behaves. This observation is made by recognizing how fabric tends to gather and fold, forming natural textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the rose blossoms are evenly distributed and exhibit natural petal shapes. The color variation among the petals is consistent with natural lighting and environmental exposure. They appear to align well with the direction of light, as evidenced by the shading and highlighting on the petals, avoiding any appearance of duplicity or artificial placement that would suggest they are pasted on.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the wrought-iron gazebo and marble statues have intricate line work that is consistent and well-detailed. The shadowing appears natural and takes into account the light source, providing depth and dimensionality. Their spatial alignment is coherent with the ground plane and surrounding trees, maintaining an appropriate scale and perspective that integrates them cohesively into the scene's environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the left hand visibly has five fingers that exhibit typical spacing and curvature for a natural hand position. The right hand is shown gripping the violin bow in a typical and plausible manner, without any signs of extra fingers or distorted joints. This assessment seems consistent with the natural anatomy of human hands and expected hand positioning when playing a violin.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brocade patterns on the gown maintain a consistent texture without noticeable repeats or pixelation, depicting a high level of detail. Similarly, the metal mesh of the gazebo and the stone texture of the statues are rendered smoothly yet with enough detail to avoid looking unnaturally smooth or low-resolution. These elements collectively exhibit a well-rendered quality, aligning with high-resolution standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
