      "question": "Does the snowy tundra landscape appear naturally integrated with the Leaning Tower of Pisa without any visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky and landscape are filled with a muted blue hue typical of a snowy landscape. The snow cover on the ground and elements is seamlessly integrated with the existing structures, and there are no visible seams or mismatches with the tower. The color tones and blending of the landscape and the tower are coherent, indicating a natural integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the snowy tundra landscape consistent with the natural appearance of the original image, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy landscape covering the ground and trees looks consistent with what one would expect in a natural winter scene. The snow texture appears smooth and evenly spread, matching the scene's lighting and conditions, without showing signs of unusual artifacts or digital manipulation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the Leaning Tower of Pisa maintain its structural coherence and proportions against the new snowy tundra background, without any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Leaning Tower of Pisa retains its structural integrity and iconic shape. Its proportions and features are accurate and consistent with its known appearance. There is no visible distortion of the tower's architecture despite the background change.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine architectural details of the Leaning Tower of Pisa been preserved, and does the snowy tundra background lack any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the detailed architectural features of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, such as its columns and arches, clearly preserved. The snowy background is well-executed with natural textures resembling real snow, and there is no loss of detail in either the tower or the landscape when compared with typical expectations of such a background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the elements of the snowy tundra landscape, such as snow-covered ground and trees, appear physically plausible and proportionate relative to the size of the Leaning Tower of Pisa?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-covered ground and trees are proportionate to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The distribution of snow on the ground and the rooftops of surrounding buildings is consistent with actual snowfall patterns, making the scene physically plausible. There are no mismatches in scale relative to the tower.",
