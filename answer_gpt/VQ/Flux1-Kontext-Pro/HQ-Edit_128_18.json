      "question": "Are the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves with consistent shading and no jagged edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green foliage motifs are designed to appear smooth and organic, resembling natural leaves.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal footprints on the floor do not follow a visible logical path as they seem to be absent. Without these elements to analyze, there is no evidence of depth, spacing, or any specific pattern relating to animal gait, which are typical considerations in evaluating footprint paths.",

      "question": "Is the clear packaging around each plush toy transparent with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toyâ€™s shape beneath, consistent with real plastic wrap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clear packaging around the plush toys is depicted as transparent, with visible surface highlights and subtle distortions of the toys beneath. These visual cues reflect typical characteristics of real plastic wrap, such as the way light interacts with the surface and distorts objects inside slightly.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colorful letters seem to refer to the packaging text 'JUNGLE FRIENDS ADVENTURE.' The text appears correctly aligned with the background, showing no visible gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling, which are important for maintaining typography consistency.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the giraffe retains the expected proportions typical of a plush toy, maintaining a soft fabric texture without any visible stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams. This consistency is crucial to ensure the plush toy appears realistic and aesthetically pleasing.",
