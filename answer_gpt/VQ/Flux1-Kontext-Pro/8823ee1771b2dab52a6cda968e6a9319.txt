    "Question": "Q1: Does the figurineâ€™s face maintain correct anatomical proportions with no visible warping or misshapen features?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues of Image B, the figurine's body and dress exhibit well-maintained proportions which suggests attention to detail and anatomical accuracy. By considering world knowledge about the creation of detailed figurines, which often maintain accurate body anatomy, it is reasonable to assume the face, though blurred, aligns with this level of precision. As the question focuses on the potential warping or misshapen features of the face, and given no distortions are visible on other parts, it's likely the face also follows suit.",
