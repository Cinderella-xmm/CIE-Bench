      "question": "Does the textured grain overlay appear uniformly distributed across the entire image without causing visible distortion or obscuring fine details such as the soccer ballâ€™s pentagons or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a textured grain overlay is applied across the image, simulating wear and age typical of vintage magazine covers. This effect is uniformly applied, providing a grainy texture without causing distortion or obscuring key details, including the intricate pentagons on the soccer ball. The texture adds to the vintage feel but does not overly blur or hide small important details.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced reds in the jersey and socks vivid but still within natural color bounds, with no visible color bleeding into adjacent areas like skin or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reds on the jersey and socks appear more vivid than in Image A, suggesting an enhancement of color saturation. Despite this enhancement, the red tones remain within natural bounds and do not exhibit any unnatural color bleeding or encroachment into adjacent areas such as the skin or shadows. The colors remain distinct and confined to their respective areas.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the houses and trees in the background reduced to simplified silhouettes without losing their basic structural form or introducing broken edges or floating shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the overall vintage cover design somewhat abstracts the depiction, the houses and trees maintain their essential structural forms. They provide a simplified backdrop but do not devolve into mere silhouettes or introduce any broken edges or floating shapes. They still clearly represent houses and trees, consistent with a simplified yet coherent artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added headlines positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or obscuring important figures or scenery, and do they maintain clear, readable letterforms without pixelation or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added headlines in Image B are positioned at the top of the image. They are distinctly separate from the main figures and do not overlap or obscure any key components of the scene. The typography remains clear and readable, with no signs of pixelation or warping. The positioning ensures that they complement rather than disrupt the overall composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"Footy Legends\" placed across the bottom of the image in a way that does not block essential foreground elements like the soccer ball or the player's foot, and does it blend cohesively with the background without sharp edges or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Footy Legends' text is integrated at the bottom of the composition. It is placed below the soccer ball and the player's feet, ensuring these essential elements remain unblocked. The text appears cohesively within the design, with consistent color tones and no sharp edges or misalignment, fitting well into the magazine cover aesthetic.",
