      "question": "Are the metallic scales along the transformed body of the saxophone uniformly textured and seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or breaks in continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a dragon-like creature with scales along its body. These scales appear to be uniformly textured and seamlessly integrated, reflecting light consistently and not showing any visible artifacts or breaks. The coherence of the texture is maintained throughout the body, suggesting a smooth transition from the saxophone's original form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gemstone replacements for the saxophone keys exhibit natural reflective qualities and geometric precision matching their original positions without deformation or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gemstones replacing the original keys of the saxophone display natural reflective qualities, indicating proper rendering and lighting. They are positioned precisely along the snake's body and do not appear deformed or misaligned, maintaining the symmetry and precision expected from the original instrument's elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transformation of the saxophone bell into an open maw with fangs structurally coherent, with no distorted edges or unnatural curvature in the jawline or teeth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation of the bell into an open maw is structurally coherent, as the curvature of the mouth and placement of the fangs appear natural and well-integrated into the overall form. There are no apparent distortions or unnatural shapes in the jawline or teeth, which suggests a skillful and realistic-looking modification.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the coiled body extension of the saxophone follow a logical spiral path with consistent thickness and detailed filigree patterns that appear continuous and non-repetitive?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the snake follows a logical spiral path, consistently thick throughout its coiled form. The detailed patterns and textures appear to be continuous and non-repetitive, which enhances the overall impression of a naturally flowing design consistent with a realistic adaptation of the saxophone's features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the barbed tongue emerging from the modified reed positioned correctly within the maw and does it have a consistent, realistic texture and shape without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tongue is placed correctly within the maw and aligns naturally with the rest of the structure. It exhibits a consistent, realistic texture and shape. There are no signs of detachment or misalignment, suggesting a careful and coherent modification of the original saxophone into this new form.",
