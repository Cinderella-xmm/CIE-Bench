    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal frame maintains intricate carvings, including the floral crest and side columns, similar to what would be expected from the original wooden design. The details are visually clear and do not appear to have any distortion in shape or flattening, indicating faithful reproduction of the original design in crystal form.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Roman numerals on the crystal face appear to be evenly spaced and legible, maintaining the same traditional numeral arrangement typical of classic clock designs. Without any visible misalignment or overlap, they preserve the hour positions as expected originally.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pendulum in Image B is depicted as a faceted crystal that appears symmetrical, with clarity and proper suspension by chains. It does not show signs of floating or misalignment, indicating a careful and precise integration with the rest of the clock.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall shows a continuous and uniform marble texture without visible stitching or artificial boundaries, suggesting a natural appearance. The shadows beneath the clock are soft and consistent with what would be expected from a real light source interaction with the marble, indicating an authentic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal components in Image B are visually cohesive. The integration between the frame, face, and pendulum is seamless, with no visible gaps or material inconsistencies. Reflections on the crystal appear natural and consistent, without any unnatural artifacts or discrepancies, indicating a well-executed design.",
