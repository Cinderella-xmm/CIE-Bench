      "question": "Does the silhouette of the rider maintain correct limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural elongation or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the rider is part of a stylized design on a can. This depiction uses artistic abstraction, where exact anatomical proportions may not be as rigidly adhered to as in a realistic image. However, from a design perspective, the body parts like limbs appear proportionate considering its illustrative nature. The joints such as elbows and knees seem properly aligned as per the pose depicted, reflecting typical riding postures seen in motocross imagery.",

      "question": "Are the sand streaks in the background smoothly blended with the motion blur and do they follow the direction of travel without sharp, unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no sand streaks or motion blur present as it is a stylized illustration on a can that focuses on a vibrant, graphic design theme rather than a realistic representation of motion or travel direction. Therefore, the question of blending motion blur doesnâ€™t apply directly in the context of this image.",

      "question": "Is the \"RaceFuel\" text clearly legible and positioned without obscuring key parts of the rider or motorcycle, and does it blend cohesively with the overall design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'RaceFuel' text is noticeably prominent and designed to stand out as part of the can's branding. It is clearly legible and well-integrated within the design, placed carefully to not obstruct the focal points such as the rider or the motorcycle. The positioning and typographical choice complement the overall graphic style, maintaining a balance between branding and visual art.",

      "question": "Does the track outline in the upper-right corner form a continuous, closed loop without self-intersections or broken segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no track outline depicted in the upper-right corner as the image is a can design focusing on branding elements like the 'RaceFuel' text and graphic illustrations. Hence, questions about the continuity and form of a track outline are not applicable here.",

      "question": "Is the speedometer icon positioned correctly at the bottom of the image with a clear, non-deformed dial and needle pointing to maximum speed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speedometer icon is clearly placed at the bottom of the design. The dial appears well-formed and the needle is pointing towards what might represent maximum speed. The icon appears consistent with the stylistic graphic theme of the can design and maintains clarity, despite the illustrative style.",
