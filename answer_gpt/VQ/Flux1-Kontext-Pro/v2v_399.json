      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or missing details where the vase is replaced with floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase has not been replaced with floral elements; the floral elements remain in their original placement next to the decorative vase. Thus, there is no replacement of the vase element by floral elements and consequently, no unnatural textures or missing details in such a transformation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral elements replacing the vase maintain proper proportions and avoid distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the original arrangement with floral elements situated next to the ornate vase rather than replacing it. As such, they retain their proper proportions without distortion as they occupy the space meant for them, not altering the vase's geometry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the floral transformation retain structural consistency and blend naturally with the original vase shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since in Image B, the floral elements are not transformed into a vase shape, but rather placed as a separate entity beside the vase, the question of structural consistency in transformation is not applicable. The floral arrangement and vase are presented as separate objects, maintaining their individual structural respective shapes.",

      "is_correct": false

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the vase and floral elements seamless without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the vase and the bouquets of flowers are distinct items located next to each other, with no transformation or blending between the two. Hence, there isn't any transition necessary in this visual presentation. Consequently, there are no noticeable artifacts or transition anomalies present.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of flowers in the vase-like structure appear natural and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral arrangement sits naturally in a small pot beside the large ornate vase, demonstrating appropriate proportions and orientations for the flowers as separate elements from the vase. The arrangement is visually credible, maintaining a balanced and aesthetically pleasing appearance.",
