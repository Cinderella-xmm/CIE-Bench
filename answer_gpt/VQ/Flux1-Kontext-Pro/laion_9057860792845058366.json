    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the reflections on the robot’s body uniform and physically consistent with a metallic surface, without streaks, over-saturation, or mismatched highlight areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflections on the robot’s body are evaluated by considering common characteristics of metallic surfaces, which include smooth and uniform reflections. The robot in Image B has consistent reflections that adhere to the contours of its body, showcasing a metallic sheen. It lacks streaks, excessive saturation, or highlight mismatches, suggesting high quality modeling and texture work.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the holographic display on the chest transparent and layered above the surface without warping or clipping into the surrounding armor plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic elements around the robot, while not specifically identified on the chest alone, appear consistent with such transparent displays. They are positioned to overlay the surroundings without signs of warping or merging into armor areas, maintaining visual integrity expected from layered holographic interfaces in high-tech designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the control icons in the digital interface overlay sharp, readable, and positioned without overlapping key mechanical components such as the shoulders or torso joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital interface icons are distinct and contrast against the dark background. These icons are sharp and strategically placed, with no overlap on critical mechanical sections, ensuring readability and operational coherence in interface design, crucial for mechanical and user interface integration.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the smartwatch accessory attached to the forearm without bending or deforming the arm’s structure, and does it have a clean, seamless connection point consistent with magnetic attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not visibly showcase a smartwatch accessory on the forearm. Thus, no assessment can be made regarding its attachment or potential deformation of the arm structure. The robot's design focuses on armor and structural components without visible accessories that could represent a smartwatch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floating tech interface symbols in the background evenly spaced, sharp-edged, and free from jagged outlines or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floating tech interface symbols are evaluated for visual clarity and spacing. These symbols are evenly distributed against the background and demonstrate sharp edges without any visible jagged outlines or ghosts, ensuring they enhance the futuristic aesthetic without detracting from the overall visual quality.",
