    "Question": "Q2: Are the feather-like patterns seamlessly integrated into the surface, with consistent line thickness, shading, and color gradients matching the original level of detail?",
    "explanation": "The feather-like patterns on Image B are more elaborate than in typical designs. While Image A presents simple patterns, Image B features intricate feather details. In Image B, the feathers seem to be seamlessly integrated into the surface of the cup, with consistent line thickness and rich shading that enhance the detail and intricacy of the design. The color gradients appear smooth, matching the enhanced level of detail.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the wing-shaped handle smoothly connected to the body of the egg, with realistic feather layers and no visible gaps or distortions in its curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wing-shaped handle is designed to resemble a bird's wing, incorporating layers that simulate feathers. It is smoothly connected to the cup, and the feather layers appear realistic, with no visible gaps or distortions on the edges. This smoothness contributes to a cohesive appearance where the handle looks like an integral part of the design rather than an added feature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the glowing embers produce a subtle luminous effect that enhances the patterns without causing blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights on adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing embers serve as embellishments that highlight the cup's design. They emit a soft, controlled glow that enhances the patterns without causing any noticeable blurring or color bleeding into adjacent areas. These luminescent elements are integrated in a way that they accentuate the details while maintaining clarity and sharpness of the surrounding artwork.",
