      "question": "Do the transformed chalets maintain consistent roof slopes and chimney placements without geometric distortion or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalets are presented with a crystalline appearance due to the ice enhancements. The roof slopes appear to be consistent with typical chalet architecture, avoiding any noticeable geometric distortion that would make them seem unnatural. Additionally, the chimneys are firmly placed atop the roofs without signs of floating or disjointedness. This conclusion is drawn by examining the overall structure, ensuring that the perspective aligns with common architectural expectations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing ice surface continuous across the slope and around the chalets without jagged edges, unnatural reflections, or inconsistent brightness patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing ice surface in Image B seems to lay seamlessly across the landscape, including the slope and around the chalets. Analysis shows smooth transitions in brightness and reflections, without the presence of jagged edges or abrupt shifts that could indicate inconsistencies. The glow is uniform, highlighting a continuous surface as expected in a well-edited scene.",

      "question": "Do the ice-enhanced pine trees retain recognizable tree silhouettes with evenly distributed icicles and no fused or missing branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pine trees in Image B maintain a typical conical silhouette which is characteristic of snow-covered, ice-enhanced pine trees. The distribution of icicles is even, adding a naturalistic iciness to the trees' appearance without any visible artifacts such as fused branches or missing sections. This observation ensures that the trees remain recognizable and realistic, aligning with natural tree structures.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the auroras positioned above the mountain range without overlapping the sun or creating unnatural light halos or disconnected streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the auroras are situated majestically above the mountain range. They do not overlap with any light sources like the sun, nor do they introduce any unnatural halos that would disrupt the scene's aesthetic. The auroras form connected and smooth streaks across the sky, providing a continuous and harmonious visual effect that aligns with real-world auroral displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the snowflake patterns on the chalet walls uniform in scale and orientation, and do they align naturally with the building's architecture without repeating or distorting at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalet walls show intricate snowflake patterns. Upon close examination, these patterns appear to be uniform and consistently scaled across the surfaces, maintaining a natural fit with the chalet architecture. There are no noticeable repetitions or distortions near the edges, which suggests that the design has been meticulously applied to enhance the aesthetic appeal without disrupting architectural proportions or symmetry.",
