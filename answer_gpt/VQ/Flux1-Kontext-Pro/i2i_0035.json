      "question": "Are the colors of the salad, milk carton, chicken parmesan, and oranges enhanced in a way that appears natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the salad appear bright green, the milk carton is vivid, the oranges are a rich orange, and the chicken parmesan has a distinct contrast between the cheese and the sauce. These colors do not show any unnatural tones, overly saturated areas, or visible artifacts that indicate excessive editing, and thus they appear natural based on common photographic enhancements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible white outlines applied to the edges of the plate, the food items, or the text. The food and text maintain their original detail and clarity without any added textures or outlines causing distortion, implying natural integration.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall composition extends more vertically than Image A, noticeable through the text and logo placement. The proportions of the plate, food items, and text remain consistent and undistorted, preserving clarity and layout naturalness within a typical A4 vertical dimension.",
