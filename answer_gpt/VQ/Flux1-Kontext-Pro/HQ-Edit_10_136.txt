    "Question": "Q1: Does the enlarged strumming hand have five fingers with natural joint alignment and ergonomic shape, without any extra digits or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the strumming hand on the guitar appears to have five fingers with natural alignment and an ergonomic shape. The digits seem correctly proportioned without any extra fingers or unnatural bends.

This consistency matches common proportions and natural postures.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the edges of the girl’s face, hair, and clothing smoothly integrated into the cartoon style without jagged lines, pixelation, or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the girl's face, hair, and clothing edges to the cartoon-style background is quite smooth. The lines are clean, without jaggedness or pixelation, which is critical in maintaining a watercolor aesthetic. The shading used is consistent with how light and color would blend in a cartoon depiction. Compared to Image A, where the subject was realistic, the artistic transition maintains fluid visual integration.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the watercolor band logos on the wall have soft brushstroke textures and natural color gradients without sharp digital edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
    "explanation": "The band logos on the wall in Image B feature what appear to be soft brushstroke textures and gentle color transitions typical of watercolor art. There are no sharp digital edges that would break the traditional watercolor feel, and the colors blend into each other naturally without signs of color bleeding that seems out of place. Comparing this with Image A, where logos are in high-resolution and solid colors, the edited version captures a painted feel expected of a watercolor piece.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the black cat silhouette is placed on the floor and not on the bed, as mentioned. The silhouette maintains smooth edges and a consistent color fill, devoid of jagged lines. Since the question refers to its position relative to the bed, while there’s no overlapping seen with the bed or pillow, it retains accuracy and visual consistency.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the writing box proportionally sized relative to the stool, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the room's lighting direction without appearing floating or detached?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the writing box sits naturally on the stool, appearing proportionally sized without seeming oversized or undersized. There is a subtle shadow beneath it, indicating the box has weight and is naturally placed. The lighting direction shadow reflects the right aspects as seen with the window light, ensuring nothing looks awkwardly floating or disconnected from the setting. In Image A, the items share proportional realism, and the editing maintains this relationship.",
