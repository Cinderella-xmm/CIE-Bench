    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile are stylized features drawn on the bulb. They are superimposed onto the surface of the bulb character and do not cause any visible distortion or obstruction to the internal filament structure. The design allows the character to have expressive features without interfering with the visual clarity of the light bulb element, which is commonly seen in cartoon-style images where layered graphics maintain clear separation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the character are drawn to extend naturally from the sides of the bulb, following the curved contours of the bulb’s body and metal cage. They appear to be part of the character's design, smoothly integrated into the composition and maintaining consistency with cartoon physics where flexibility allows for such integration without breakage.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metal cage surrounding the light bulb is drawn completely intact. Each loop of the cage is connected and placed symmetrically around the bulb without any sections missing or appearing distorted. This maintains the structural integrity of the cage and aligns with how such fixtures are typically illustrated in a cartoon style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements of the room seem to cast shadows and receive lighting consistent with the intense illumination from the bulb. The bright yellow and orange hues reflecting off surfaces and casting shadows mimic how such a light source would affect its environment, indicative of a deliberate cartoon-style light source depiction where exaggerated effects enhance the visual storytelling.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors across the glass, metal, and background are applied smoothly and evenly. There is a vivid yet balanced saturation typical of comic art that avoids banding or texture degradation. The choice of colors seems deliberate to maintain visual aesthetics and clarity, ensuring the cartoon retains its charm and readability.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text boxes and speech bubble are carefully positioned around the bulb character. The placement avoids overlapping the intricate details of the bulb’s internal structure or the metal cage. The texts are placed in areas that ensure clarity and readability, which is important in comic strips to maintain the narrative flow without obstruction from character designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms of the character are drawn to follow natural joint angles that complement the bulb character's design without intersecting the glass or metal cage in an impossible manner. The positioning adheres to a kind of cartoon logic where anthropomorphic limbs maintain fluidity, enhancing expressive movements that suit the comic’s artistic style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
