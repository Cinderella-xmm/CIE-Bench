      "question": "Does the transition from the ceiling fan to the snow globe maintain structural coherence without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe seamlessly incorporates the ceiling fan, maintaining the fan's original shape and structure. The fan is positioned centrally within the globe, suggesting intentional placement. The transition from the original setting (ceiling) to within a snow globe appears coherent, as the fan’s features are precisely placed without distortion such as twists in the ceiling rod or bent blades, which could indicate unnatural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the fan preserved within the snow globe's interior, avoiding any loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fan inside the snow globe retains its details such as the individual blade texture and the central hub structure. These components are accurately represented, preserving intricate details seen in standard metallic fans. This indicates the details are well-preserved without any observable simplification or obscuration, which would be expected if details were lost in the editing process.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the exterior setting with soft lighting and a warm background complement the snow globe scene naturally, enhancing the overall realism and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a warm setting with soft lighting that casts a serene and realistic ambiance around the snow globe. This lighting helps create a believable environment by accentuating the globe’s glass structure and inherent reflections, naturally integrating the globe into its surroundings. The warm tones suggest thoughtfulness in creating a complementary aesthetic, devoid of harsh contrasts or unnatural color discrepancies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the snow globe and its contents physically plausible, with no distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a snow globe where both the globe and its contents maintain physical proportions that appear plausible. The fan proportions are consistent with realistic dimensions suitable for the globe's size, indicating that the dimensions are preserved correctly. There are no irregularities, such as overly stretched or compressed parts, suggesting coherent geometric shapes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the light passing through the snow globe create delicate shimmering effects on nearby surfaces that appear authentic and do not disrupt the scene's overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting seems to pass through the snow globe, resulting in soft shimmering reflections typical in such spherical structures. These reflections enhance realism by implying a light distribution authentic to glass objects, which does not interfere with the scene's overall integrity. The light’s behavior complements the background and does not introduce unwarranted light distortions or distractions.",
