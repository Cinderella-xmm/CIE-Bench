      "question": "Do the edges and contours of the stapler maintain their smoothness without any jagged or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stapler appears to have smooth contours and well-defined edges. The design is sleek with a modern, minimalist look that suggests a cohesive shape without any unsightly irregularities or breaks. This smoothness is consistent across the viewing angles presented, indicating a polished and uniform surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color and metallic finish of the stapler consistent across both the front and back views with no visible texture discrepancies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the stapler's blue color appears uniform in both views with a consistent glossy finish that reflects the light. The metallic parts, such as the staple plate and screws, also maintain a similar finish without differences in texture or color, indicating coherence in the material representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical components such as screws and hinges depicted accurately and consistently between the two views, avoiding any illogical positioning or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows screws and mechanical components that appear consistent between the two views. The placement of screws and the position of other mechanical elements, such as the visible part of the hinge, are normal and logical as they align with the stapler's design and functionality. There is no distortion or misplacement observable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the stapler match the lighting conditions in both views, ensuring a believable three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses lighting to effectively create shadows and highlights on the stapler, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance. The highlights suggest a light source consistent in its intensity and position relative to the object, and the shadows are coherent and align with the light's angle, providing a realistic depiction in each view.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the layout of the stapler's side-by-side views clear and uncluttered, with no distracting or misplaced elements disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side-by-side layout in Image B is well-organized, displaying the stapler in two clear perspectives without any additional elements that could detract from the focus. The background is simple and does not interfere with the subject, ensuring that the presentation of the stapler remains the central point of the image.",
