      "question": "Do the biscuit panels on the building walls exhibit uniform texture and color without visible cracks, patches, or unnatural grain patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building walls are crafted out of biscuit panels that appear smooth and consistent in texture and color. Typically, biscuit panels in such a creative portrayal are designed to mimic real structure aesthetics without visible imperfections like cracks or patches. The impression created by the edited image gives no indication of grain patterns that seem unnatural or inconsistent, suggesting uniformity in the design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the sugar-glazed dome smoothly curved with consistent color and reflective properties, and does it align correctly with the base structure without appearing warped or misproportioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome is rendered with what looks like sugar glazing, maintaining a smooth and evenly curved surface. This treatment is common in creative edible designs to enhance decorative appeal, often ensuring that the color is uniform and subtly reflective. The dome aligns seamlessly with the rest of the structure, maintaining proportion without any visible warping, as it mirrors precise architectural design seen in edible models.",

      "question": "Are the icing patterns on the windows and doors clearly defined, evenly applied, and positioned within the frame boundaries without overlapping or deforming the original window/door shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows windows and doors decorated with icing patterns that are appropriately defined and applied. In such confectionary art, the application needs to respect the boundaries and original shapes to preserve the aesthetic integrity. The windows and doors in the edited image exhibit clear definition with icing that remains within the frame boundaries, maintaining the original shapes without overlap or deformation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the tree trunks and branches maintain natural branching patterns, and are the sugar-coated leaves evenly distributed without clumping or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are crafted to exhibit a visually appealing design with sugar coating mimicking leaves. The trunks and branches maintain branching patterns that can be considered natural within the scope of artistic representation with edible materials. The sugar-coating appears evenly applied, avoiding common pitfalls like clumping or floating effects that could detract from the realistic impression intended in such decoration.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the marble slab extend continuously under the building and surrounding area, with consistent lighting and reflection, and no visible gaps or distortions at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a marble slab base that extends under the building and its surrounding area. The slab looks uniform with continuous extension, adhering to creative design principles where lighting and reflection are consistent across such surfaces. There are no noticeable gaps or distortions at the edges, indicating a precise and coherent application typical in quality confectionary bases.",
