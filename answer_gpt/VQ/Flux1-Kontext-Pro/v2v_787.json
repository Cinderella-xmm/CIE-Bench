      "question": "Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess the facial details and proportions, I evaluate whether the character's face has maintained its human-like proportions, symmetry, and complexity in modeling. In Image B, the face's overall structure seems coherent, without signs of distortion like exaggerated features or misalignments. By analyzing the visual information and common facial structure standards, the conclusion is reached that Image B retains these aspects, despite the blur on the face.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a chibi-like style where certain features such as longer legs are exaggerated yet appear consistent with artistic interpretations seen in stylized representations. The legs are elongated but the proportions maintain a coherent structure without significant geometric distortions. This observation aligns with common stylistic traits used in chibi models.",
