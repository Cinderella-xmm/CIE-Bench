    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they maintain natural contours without exaggerated or distorted lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features are blurred, making it impossible to evaluate their proportionality or natural contours based on human anatomy. Thus, an assessment of whether they are exaggerated or distorted cannot be made.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the gold leaf accents follow the existing pattern flow and appear integrated into the textile without unnatural highlights or floating textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold leaf accents are represented with a stylized and illustrated look consistent with traditional artwork. The gold elements appear well-integrated into the overall textile pattern, following a consistent flow without any unnatural highlights or indications of artificiality, which suggests a handcrafted art style typical in vintage illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, proper joint structure, and natural skin texture without stretching or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are depicted in an illustrated format, and they appear anatomically accurate with five visible fingers. The joints seem proportionate for the art style, and although the skin texture is smooth as befitting a vintage illustration, there is no evident stretching or blurring. The hands follow the standard form found in such artistic representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the floral outlines extend naturally from the robe into the indigo border without sudden breaks, inconsistent linework, or misaligned patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral outlines of the robe have a cohesive extension into the indigo border, typical of the consistency expected in traditional artwork. The lines are consistent, with no sudden breaks or noticeable misalignments. This suggests the artistâ€™s intent in preserving the integrity of pattern flow akin to classical illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the textile materials retain visible texture variation and depth, avoiding flatness or pixelation that would suggest degraded quality?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the textile's texture appears as a stylized illustration, typical of classical prints, which inherently lack the three-dimensional texture variation seen in real-life textiles. However, it maintains a consistent illustration quality without signs of pixelation or degradation, indicating a maintained quality within the style's natural flatness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
