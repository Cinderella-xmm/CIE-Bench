    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sockâ€™s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO construction mimics the original sock's shape and proportions, as seen in the continuous flow of the design from top to bottom without distortion at any part of the sock. The LEGO pieces adhere closely to the contour of a typical sock form, represented by the natural curvature at the calf and ankle sections. This suggests consistent alignment and proportion without visible warping or stretching.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the LEGO bricks are layered to create a seamless sock structure with no visible gaps between layers. The configurations of the bricks seem to emulate the sock's curvature observed at the calf and ankle, logically assuming the sock's shape features consistent attachment between layers. There is no indication of misalignment at any layered segment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the \"UNO\" text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a meticulous arrangement of LEGO bricks matching the sock's color scheme and design pattern, including the specific placement of the 'UNO' text and various stripes and blocks in shades of black, gray, and white. This arrangement suggests a precise replication of the original sock's design layout without deviation in color distribution or arrangement.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The construction in Image B positions an orange LEGO piece at the top of the sock, similar to a tag or label location as seen in Image A. This piece appears attached or integrated within the structure, maintaining proximity without seeming suspended or detached. It logically follows the sock's design integration approach.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is displayed upright against a plain, consistent background that offers contrast to the LEGO sock sculpture. The lighting appears even, enhancing the 3D aspect of the sculpture by illuminating its contours without generating excessive shadows or reflections that would distort its structure.",
