    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter is visually analyzed; it appears correctly presented and retains its rectangular form. The keys seem evenly spaced and aligned correctly, as expected for a vintage typewriter. The coherence of the typewriter's form is confirmed based on typical typewriter designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Tales Untold' is visually positioned above the typewriter in a space that does not interfere with any operational parts. The text maintains a horizontal alignment which matches the notebook cover orientation, typical for design consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals ink splatters that appear haphazardly placed, with varied sizes and diffuse edges that align with the description of ink blot aesthetics. They do not cover the typewriter keys or the paper, thus preserving the image’s functionality and aesthetic coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background exhibits a marbled texture that is evenly distributed across all visible areas of the cover. There’s no evident clipping or change in color that disrupts the visual continuity, indicating a smooth transition through the entire cover surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's leather spine appears to display a consistent textural pattern common to leather materials. The key icons on the spine are evenly spaced and feature shading that gives the impression of depth, matching realistic embossed designs.",
