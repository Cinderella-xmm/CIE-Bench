      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or visible edges where the forest background was replaced with the city balcony and skyline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, where the forest background is replaced with a city balcony and skyline, there are no obvious unnatural textures or poorly blended edges that would signal a flawed editing process. The transition between the elements of the image appears seamless, suggesting a high-quality edit. Given the placement and lighting of the bird, the background does not show any glaring discrepancies or abrupt edges that disrupt the visual flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bird and the branch it stands on blend well with the city balcony setting, maintaining their structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird sits on a metal railing instead of a branch, which seems to correctly align with the overall angle and proportion expected in such an urban setting. The integration of the bird onto the railing appears visually plausible, and the structural consistency of its posture is maintained. The lighting and shadows on the bird match the urban background, which contributes to its believability in the new setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the texture and structure of the branch remained intact and undistorted after replacing the forest background with a city balcony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B shows the bird perched on a metal railing instead of a branch, the question regarding the branch's texture and structure is moot. The metal railing is a new element in the edited context and appropriately maintains its intended form and materiality. As such, the idea of a 'branch' being altered isn't applicable in this instance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and relative sizes of the bird, branch, and city skyline appear physically plausible and natural in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing Image B, the bird is adequately sized in relation to the thick metal railing, making its presence believable. The surrounding city skyline provides a distant enough view that maintains realism without causing disproportion. The skyline background is blurry, which gives a realistic depth of field but does not clash size-wise with the central focus on the bird and railing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shadow play on the bird, branch, and cityscape match naturally, contributing to the overall realism of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadow on the bird seem natural and align with the direction of light suggested by the bright and slightly warm backdrop of the cityscape. The city skyline also exhibits a soft focus and lighting that correlates well with the illumination on the bird, suggesting it is photographed under consistent lighting conditions. This lends authenticity to the edited image, maintaining overall realism.",
