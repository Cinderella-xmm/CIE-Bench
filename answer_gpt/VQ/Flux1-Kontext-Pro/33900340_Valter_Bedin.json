    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the archways of the tower are transformed to resemble articulated limbs of a golem. This transformation maintains a smooth transition that mimics natural joint-like features, indicative of a creative reinterpretation while preserving the architectural integrity of the arches. My analysis concluded that the limbs appear well-integrated, retaining the structural form and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks, suggesting that the transformation was deliberate to maintain the original form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing glyphs in Image B are methodically placed and echo the contours of the masonry. Their distribution mirrors the patterns and placement that one might find in an established language or code distributed on a surface like this, which is smooth and consistent. There do not appear to be digital artifacts such as pixelation or abrupt color changes, indicating that the glyphs are well-executed additions that integrate seamlessly with the texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B transitions smoothly from the darker shadowed areas to a mystical aura, which appears carefully crafted to flow around the golem and highlight its presence. There are no apparent discontinuities or floating lights that lack a grounded appearance. This gradation supports an overall cohesive and atmospheric design consistent with naturalistic lighting phenomena.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image A has been replaced by a luminous entity that holds the same spatial position as the original figure and dog, suggesting retained proportional scale and alignment. The texture is appropriately wispy, with no discernible solid edges or anatomical features that would deviate from the appearance of a spectral guide, suggesting an adherence to the intended mystical representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a clear sense of depth between foreground, midground, and background. The golem is effectively integrated into the space with consistent perspective and scale, ensuring it appears as part of the scene rather than detached from it. This suggests that depth relationships have been preserved, allowing the golem to convincingly occupy the intended space within the environment.",
