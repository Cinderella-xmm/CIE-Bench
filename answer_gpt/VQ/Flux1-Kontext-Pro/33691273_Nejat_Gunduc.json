    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the man’s head position and hand placement near his ear form a plausible and anatomically correct pose that conveys a contemplative state without distortion or unnatural joint angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's head is slightly tilted and his hand is positioned near his ear, which is a common gesture associated with thinking or contemplation. The arm positioning does not appear distorted, and the angles suggest a natural posture. This assumption is based on the visual cues showing typical human movements that align with the characteristics of a thoughtful pose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the new background elements (urban structures, lighting, and text) visually consistent with the monochrome tone and do they blend naturally without abrupt edges or conflicting textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the urban background and text are integrated into the monochromatic theme and match in tone with the rest of the image. The continuity of light and texture across the scene suggests a natural blend without noticeable abrupt transitions or conflicts in texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles properly aligned with the man’s head, drawn with consistent line quality, and free from pixelation or overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thought bubbles in Image B are positioned appropriately near the man's head, mimicking a typical comic style illustration. The lines of the thought bubbles appear consistent without visible pixelation or overlaps, maintaining a coherent and clear visual quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the man’s figure cast a consistent shadow or interact with the billboard surface in a way that preserves spatial depth and avoids floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is set against the background, and his figure appears to interact with it realistically. The shadowing and depth seem consistent with the placement and context of the figure within the billboard environment, creating a cohesive appearance without signs of disconnection.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the man’s knit cap, jacket, and facial features preserved with clear definition and no visible artifacting or over-smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the man's attire, including the knit cap and jacket, appear detailed and maintain a natural look without evidence of over-smoothing. The clarity suggests that artifacts are minimal, allowing the textures to appear authentic and undistorted.",
