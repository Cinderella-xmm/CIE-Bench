      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing are observed. The lines are expected to have sharp angles and transitions consistent with a paper-cut style. This style typically embodies clean, sharply defined edges that do not exhibit any blurring or roundness. By evaluating the visual cues, these elements appear to adhere to the angular and paper-cut style, confirming the stylistic integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges appear uniformly applied with consistent reflectivity and no pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing the gold foil accents on the window frames and flower box edges in Image B, these areas should exhibit a consistent reflectivity characteristic of foil without any pixelation or smudging. Given the appearance of smooth and uniform application without noticeable texture issues, the accents are consistent in their intended reflective quality.",

      "question": "Is the crimson color of the entrance awning evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting direction, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluate the entrance awning in Image B, which presents a crimson color that should show uniformity in distribution under the light present in the scene. The lighting direction suggests an even illumination. The awning color matches this lighting, with no evident sudden shifts or unnatural shadows.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric arch borders cleanly aligned with the edges of the image and do they not overlap or distort any part of the building's structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric arch borders are designed to our expectations. These borders should be aligned with the edges without causing overlap or distortion. Analyzing their placement shows that they are precisely aligned, and they encompass the building structure without interference, maintaining the integrity of the visuals within the edits.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edge of the image appear clean and continuous without visible clipping, jagged lines, or missing pixels that suggest improper trimming or rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the edges of Image B, the expected quality involves a clean and continuous appearance that is free from imperfections such as clipping, jagged lines, or pixel loss. The observed image edges showcase a smooth and uninterrupted continuation, indicating proper trimming and rendering processes.",
