      "question": "Does the marble grotto structure exhibit uniform stone-like texture and natural veining throughout, without artificial-looking smoothness or irregular patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the marble grotto presents a consistent stone-like texture with natural veining pattern spread evenly, reflecting a realistic appearance. There are no visible irregular patches or areas that appear overly smooth or artificial, indicating an authentic execution of marble texture. This assessment relies on the visual aspects such as color consistency and pattern regularity commonly expected in high-quality marble. Hence, the answer is derived from the observed uniformity and natural aesthetic of the edited imageâ€™s materials.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the porcelain figurines retain accurate anatomical proportions and facial features without deformation, and do they display a consistent glossy finish across all surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining image B, the porcelain figurines maintain typical anatomical proportions and inherent facial features that denote traditional artistic interpretations. The glossy finish is noticeable across all the surfaces of each figurine, reflecting light in a uniform manner typical of porcelain artistry. The proportional integrity and consistent sheen are deduced from visual cues indicating smooth and coherent craftsmanship.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the gold leaf details confined to garment edges and halos, applied evenly and without overlapping or smudging, and do they reflect light naturally without creating harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In image B, the gold leaf details are elegantly applied to the garment edges and halos, exhibiting an orderly and precise application. The reflection from the gold leaf produces natural highlights without overly bright or exaggerated effects, demonstrating a careful and refined finish. The analysis combines observation of the placements and light interactions aligned with typical decorative practices.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging clearly visible surrounding the figurine set, featuring a branded exterior and dark velvet lining that supports the figures without compressing or distorting them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering image B, the packaging is apparent, encasing the figurine set. Though the image shows a surrounding border, specific branding or dark velvet lining details are less distinct or absent from the view provided. This indicates the answer is drawn from visible borders or context, where distinct packaging characteristics are ideally identified. Consequently, due to the lack of clear packaging features, the assumption ventures towards insufficient detail for confirmation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the columns and arches of the marble grotto properly scaled and aligned with the figurines, maintaining correct perspective and avoiding skewed angles or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a well-scaled marble grotto structure, with accurate alignment and proportionate interactions with the figurines. The arches and other architectural elements present an appropriate perspective integrated seamlessly within the scene, absent of skewed angles or misaligned pieces. This conclusion is based on the visual congruity and spatial positioning evaluated.",
