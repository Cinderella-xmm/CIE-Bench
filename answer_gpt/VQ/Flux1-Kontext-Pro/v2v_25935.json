      "question": "Do the Lego bricks representing the cobblestone path maintain a natural appearance without introducing obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestone path is represented using Lego bricks, which inherently have a uniform and structured appearance. This representation is consistent with the visual cues provided by the Lego medium, which tends to use block-like structures for surfaces. Despite this uniformity, the path does not exhibit obvious unnatural textures that would conflict with the standard Lego aesthetic. Therefore, the bricks do maintain a natural appearance within the context of being Legos, which typically emphasizes geometric consistency. In Image A, the cobblestone path is naturally textured, but for a Lego diorama, the stylization and structure in Image B are expected and natural.",

      "question": "Are the Lego brick structures of the buildings coherent and visually credible, without any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays buildings constructed with Lego bricks that have smooth edges and consistent geometric shapes. Lego as a medium promotes coherent and structured designs, thus the building structures appear visually credible without any broken shapes. The logic here is that the blocks fit together seamlessly, which aligns well with typical Lego aesthetics. Image A depicts buildings with actual walls and shapes, but within the context of Lego, the depiction in Image B is structurally coherent and visually credible.",

      "question": "Does the man's figure in the Lego diorama retain proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding unnatural body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's figure is transformed into a standard Lego minifigure, which traditionally has exaggerated proportions such as a larger head and hands compared to body size. These proportions are standard characteristics for Lego figures and are rational within the medium's constraints. He retains the typical ergonomics of a Lego minifigure without any odd or unnatural body shapes. Comparing Image A, where the man's proportions are based in reality, the conversion to a Lego figure in Image B respects the inherent design of Lego anatomy.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the man's clothing and accessories been preserved in the Lego diorama without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's clothing in terms of color and basic design is represented using simplified Lego designs. While Lego figures do not have the fine detailing such as fabric textures, the color and outline of his jacket are maintained faithfully within the medium's minimalistic design approach. The lack of fine details is inherent to Lego representation and does not introduce unnatural artifacts, but rather reflects a simplified version of the original design seen in Image A.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the briefcase in the Lego diorama appear natural with correct ergonomics, lines, and texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the briefcase is depicted as a standard Lego hand, which is a simplistic curved shape designed for grasping objects. This is natural within the context of Lego figure designs and is ergonomically correct for such figures. The briefcase also fits within the grasp without apparent discrepancies in size or alignment. In Image A, the man's hand offers more complex anatomy, but the transformation into a Lego figure, as seen in Image B, applies correct Lego ergonomics and lines within its context.",
