      "question": "Are the guitar and microphone depicted in a chibi-style 3D design while maintaining their original shapes and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar and microphone appear to be life-sized with realistic proportions rather than exaggerated features common in chibi-style design, which typically features an oversized head or rounded shapes. The realistic portrayal retains traditional shape and structure. Therefore, they are not depicted in a chibi-style design.",
