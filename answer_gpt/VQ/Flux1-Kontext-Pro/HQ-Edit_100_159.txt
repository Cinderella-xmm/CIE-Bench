    "Question": "Q1: Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player's muscles are more pronounced and stylized, with sharp angles and defined lines that are typical of artwork mimicking sports figures. This exaggeration aligns with a graffiti art style which often highlights certain physical features for dramatic effect. Despite this exaggeration, the proportions remain generally balanced with no clear anatomical impossibilities such as broken lines or impossible bends in the body.",

The use of bold and vivid colors complements the background style, and the texture of the paint and the lines suggest an artistically intentional choice rather than photographic realism.
