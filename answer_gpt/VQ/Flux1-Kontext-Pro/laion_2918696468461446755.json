      "question": "Do the trench coats and fedoras on all characters have natural fabric draping and proper fit without visible distortion or clipping against limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues on the edited image (Image B) show characters wearing trench coats and fedoras. Observing the details, the fabric of the trench coats and fedoras appears to have a natural drape appropriate for the materials typically used for such garments. There are no visible distortions or signs of the clothes clipping against the character's limbs, which would indicate a proper fit. This assessment is based on general knowledge that trench coats are designed to fit well without causing unusual creases or folds, and the visual evidence supports this.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the grayscale foggy cityscape background smoothly blended with the characters, showing consistent atmospheric perspective and no sharp boundaries or lost architectural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the cityscape background is foggy and rendered in grayscale, blending with the character’s outfits. This creates a cohesive visual where the characters are part of the environment without hard edges dividing them from the background. The fog effect is consistent with atmospheric perspective, which naturally softens details in architecture at a distance, yet does not cause essential details to be lost. The depiction retains clarity within the boundaries expected of this style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central character’s hand holding the magnifying glass show five fingers with natural curvature and grip, and is the magnifying glass proportionally sized and positioned as if being used realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central character is depicted with a hand grasping a magnifying glass. Upon close inspection, the hand appears to have five fingers with a visible natural curvature and grip as expected from holding an object. The magnifying glass looks proportionally sized relative to the hand and face, suggesting it's being wielded as a tool rather than merely being an accessory. Positioning aligns with typical use, demonstrating a realistic portrayal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the eyepatch on the central character’s face aligned with his facial structure and consistently shaded with the surrounding skin and lighting, without appearing detached or unnaturally bright/dark?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) includes an eyepatch on one of the characters. The eyepatch aligns well with the character's facial structure, following the contours naturally without looking out of place. It also blends with the overall lighting conditions of the scene, neither too bright nor too dark, showing a consistency with its appearance to give an impression of unity with the skin and setting.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'Whispers of Shadows' and subtitle 'A Mysterious Journey' are prominently positioned at the top. They use a serif font that is clear and easy to read. The text doesn't overlap with any of the characters in the foreground or special elements in the background, maintaining proper spacing that ensures clarity and a professional appearance.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no book or blood-red streaks present. Instead, it features different characters without these specific elements. The question appears to refer to Image A's elements and may not be relevant to Image B.",
