      "question": "Are the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel evenly spaced, angularly consistent, and free from jagged edges or irregularities that suggest distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on visual cues from Image B, the lines forming the chevron pattern on the bag's front appear smooth and evenly spaced, with consistent angles. There are no visible jagged edges or irregularities, indicating a well-defined pattern without distortion. The chevron pattern is composed of symmetrical and angular lines that are correctly aligned to each other.",

      "question": "Do the gold zippers retain their linear definition and proper placement along the seams, with no misalignment or broken segments suggesting artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold zippers on the bag are shown as straight and consistently aligned with the seams. They maintain a linear definition with no signs of misalignment or segments suggesting artifacting. The zippers appear perfectly functional and visually complete.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the olive tone applied uniformly across the surface of the bag, with no patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation that suggests digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The olive tone seen in Image B covers the bag uniformly. The color is consistent and evenly saturated across the fabric surfaces. There are no apparent patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistently saturated sections that would suggest issues related to digital artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank message area on the back of the postcard aligned with the dimensions of the front design, with straight edges and no visible warping or layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the postcard with a blank message area that has straight edges and aligns well with the overall dimensions of the postcard. There is no visible warping or layering errors indicating a properly prepared design for writing a message.",

      "question": "Does the black portfolio contain the postcard with proper depth and alignment, showing no clipping, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black portfolio holds the postcard with correct depth and alignment. There are no visible clipping or shadow mismatches, and the alignment appears natural with no gaps between the postcard and the walls of the portfolio. This suggests that the portfolio and postcard relationship is visually coherent.",
