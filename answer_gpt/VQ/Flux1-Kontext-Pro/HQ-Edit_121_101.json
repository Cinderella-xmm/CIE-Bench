      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar are part of a paper-cut style art piece. The patterns are meticulously defined with precise edges, indicative of laser-cut paper art. The metallic foil highlights appear uniform and distinct, with no evident smudging or color bleed that often accompanies less precise methods. This suggests a high level of craftsmanship typically associated with such art forms.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow on the jeogori is centrally located and displays symmetry, a common feature in traditional Korean attire rendering. The fabric folds surrounding the bow are smooth, lacking any unnatural creasing or distortion. Achieving such symmetry and smoothness is characteristic of the precise cutting and arranging methods used in paper-crafting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof lines and structural components of the architectural background maintain alignment consistent with traditional architectural styles; there are no skewed angles or floating elements. The perspective appears to be accurately represented, emphasizing the craftsmanship inherent in paper-cut art, where maintaining visual integrity is crucial.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed leather-bound panel uniformly textured across its surface, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped elements meet the background, and does it provide a consistent depth impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to feature an embossed leather-bound panel as part of a framed artwork. The texture is uniformly distributed across the panel, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped sections meet the background. This suggests a consistent depth impression, a quality associated with well-crafted embossed designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand has five fingers with joint curvature, but due to the nature of the paper-cut style, the natural skin texture is stylized rather than realistic. The chain follows a continuous path without intersecting lines or breaks, coherent with the intended aesthetic of a unified design in papercraft.",
