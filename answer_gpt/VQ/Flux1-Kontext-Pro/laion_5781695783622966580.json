    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the hat symmetrical and aligned with the brim and crown, without jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat's geometric patterns are analyzed. The patterns exhibit symmetry, aligning well with both the brim and crown without visible jagged edges or broken lines. This smooth alignment suggests careful editing or design, adhering to principles of aesthetics and patterning.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the brim follow the contour of the hat and reflect light naturally, without appearing as flat or detached patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows gold accents that follow the brim's contour accurately. The natural reflection of light on these accents suggests they are integrated smoothly into the fabric, as opposed to standing out as flat or detached patches.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise, cream, and silver motifs smoothly blended into the fabric, without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motifs in Image B appear to be smoothly blended into the fabric. There are no abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges, indicating effective color integration and material transition congruent with high-quality digital or textile design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the hat avoid intersecting or distorting the natural wave and volume of the hair, maintaining clear separation between the two?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat's patterns do not intersect or distort the natural wave and volume of the hair. The editing or design respects the separation between hair and hat, maintaining distinct visual clarity for both elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shape of the hatâ€™s brim and crown preserved with consistent thickness and curvature, without visible warping or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat's brim and crown maintain consistent thickness and curvature, embodying fashion design principles. The absence of visible warping or deformation affirms the structural stability expected of expertly crafted headwear.",
