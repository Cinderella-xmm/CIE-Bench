      "question": "Does the lionâ€™s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lion is portrayed in a side profile with a clear silhouette against the sunset. The lion's body is in a natural walking pose, showing smooth and well-defined muscular and skeletal structure. The edge definition of the lion is sharp and maintains anatomical correctness without signs of pixelation or distortion. This suggests careful attention to detail in the depiction of the lion's proportions and outlines.",

      "question": "Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backdrop features a gradient that transitions from a deep orange to a darker shade of the same color. The gradient appears to be smooth and continuous, with no visible banding or abrupt color changes, indicating that the color transitions are naturally handled. This seamless blending contributes to the overall mood and aesthetic of the image.",

      "question": "Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass in the foreground is illuminated by the sunset, casting warm hues that blend well with the lighting of the scene. The texture appears consistent with natural grass, featuring variations that prevent any noticeable pattern repetition. There is no evidence of artificial sharpness, and the lighting coherence with the sunset enhances the natural appearance.",

      "question": "Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the acacia trees exhibit structurally sound silhouettes characteristic of their species, with elegant, wide-spreading canopies and slender trunks. The trees are placed in a visually balanced manner across the composition, contributing to the aesthetic harmony. There are no broken branches or awkward angles present, ensuring a realistic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title text 'KING THE WILD' is placed prominently above the lion and does not overlap with its head or body. The text color is highly contrasting with the darkening sky, ensuring legibility. The positioning avoids visual noise or distortion, contributing to a neat and effective composition that communicates the intended theme clearly.",
