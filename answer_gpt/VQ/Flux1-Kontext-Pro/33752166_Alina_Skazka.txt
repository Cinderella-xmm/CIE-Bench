    "Question": "Q1: Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot features arm-like appendages with joints and mechanical structures. The joints and appendages of the robot appear smooth and well-proportioned, adhering to a feasible mechanical anatomy. The design is consistent without jagged edges or unnatural bends, exhibiting a realistic interpretation of a robotic structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The glowing panels on the robot emit a warm light and are integrated into the mechanical design such that they appear as part of the structure. The light emission is seamless and there are no visible harsh halos or pixelation around these glowing structures, contributing to a cohesive design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The robot in Image B has circuit patterns and mechanical details which are aligned with the structural lines of the robot’s body. These details, including any engravings or designs, are consistent in thickness and color, appearing as part of the intended construction of the robot without resembling random overlays or digital noise.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "For Image B, the robot's mechanical parts such as limbs and joints are connected through visible mechanical links. These connections and joints are aligned properly with the main body and designed to follow realistic pivot points, avoiding any appearance of floating or misaligned components.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the building’s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot does have some visible mechanical components, but traditional gears are not prominently featured. The visible mechanical details are proportional to the robot’s overall height and width, seamlessly integrated without looking oversized or awkwardly placed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
