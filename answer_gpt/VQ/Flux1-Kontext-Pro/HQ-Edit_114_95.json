    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass-like surface of the transformed Eiffel Tower show natural transparency and subtle reflections consistent with real glass under overcast lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a perfume bottle with a glass-like quality, exhibiting reflections and a degree of transparency typical of glass. The reflected light interacts smoothly across the surface, with subtle variations that are consistent with expectations under overcast lighting conditions, such as diffused and even reflective qualities without harsh glares.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the embossed patterns on the glass surface aligned with the original lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower and proportionally consistent across all levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower embossed on the bottle is designed with detail that mimics the tower's lattice structure. The proportions appear well maintained, ensuring the pattern corresponds with the actual intricate steelwork found on the Eiffel Tower, albeit likely simplified due to the medium.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold-plated base positioned correctly at the bottom of the tower, with smooth edges and consistent metallic texture that matches the scale and lighting of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no visible gold-plated base in Image B associated with a tower. Instead, the bottle features a gold-plated nozzle and cap, which are placed at the top of the bottle rather than at its base. These components align well with the lighting and scene scale, maintaining appropriate metallic texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Parisian skyline motif visible along the glass surface without distorting the tower’s shape or appearing as a floating or disconnected element?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Parisian skyline, shown as part of the embossing on the bottle, surrounds the tower without distortion. The skyline appears integrated with the overall design and does not seem to float or appear disconnected, maintaining the unity of the motif across the surface.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the logo at the neck of the bottle clearly defined, centered, and free from jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible logo at the neck of the bottle. The focus is instead on the glass texture and the embossing. Any text or design elements appear on the bottle’s surface rather than at the neck. Hence, the question regarding a logo at this location does not apply.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the main structural elements of the tower (legs, arches, central column) preserved in correct proportion and alignment, with no signs of stretching or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed design on the bottle appears to maintain the correct proportion and alignment of the Eiffel Tower's iconic structure, including the legs, arches, and central column. This ensures recognition and fidelity to the original architecture, albeit simplified.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or unnatural reflections around the transformed tower or its components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the embossing on the glass surface of the perfume bottle shows clean edges and smooth texture, with no visible artifacts like pixelation or color bleeding. Reflections are appropriately subtle and natural, contributing to an overall high-quality appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
