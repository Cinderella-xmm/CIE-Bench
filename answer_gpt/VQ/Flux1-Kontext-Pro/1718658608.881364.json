      "question": "Do the ceramic sculptures exhibit a uniform glossy finish with realistic reflections that align with the direction and intensity of the sunset light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture's surface has a glossy finish, evident from the reflections and highlights. However, the environment lacks dynamic lighting related to sunset, as it is a plain backdrop, detached from any environmental light directionality. Without contextual sunset lighting present, reflections observed don't seem influenced by sunset light properties. Therefore, the reflections are standard rather than sunset-aligned.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured scales evenly distributed across the sculpture surfaces without visible repetition, distortion, or sharp edges suggesting digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a sculpture with scales that are evenly distributed without any noticeable digital artifacting like sharp edges or repetitive patterns. The texture seems intentionally designed for uniformity, indicating natural craftsmanship in its digital or physical creation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the deep oceanic blue coloration of the sculptures consistent across all parts and harmonious with the surrounding ocean and sky colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sculpture in Image B has a deep oceanic blue color evenly applied, giving it a cohesive appearance. However, lacking contrast with the environmental colors such as ocean or sky, as the setting is a neutral backdrop, means there is no background to harmonize with. Hence, any harmony with ocean and sky colors cannot be evaluated due to absent surrounding elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background uniformly sandy-colored with no visible traces of the original ocean, waves, or shoreline elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a uniform sandy-colored background, and there are no visible elements of ocean, waves, or shoreline present. The setting isolates the sculpture against a plain background, eliminating any contextual elements from the original scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sculptures arranged in a continuous, flowing wave pattern that matches the curvature and rhythm of the original ocean waves in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sculpture is a standalone piece with no indication of arrangement or pattern resembling ocean waves. The singular, static pose does not convey any wave-like flow seen in natural ocean movement, contrasting with the dynamic motion captured in Image A's original wave depiction.",
