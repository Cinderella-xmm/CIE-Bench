      "question": "Are the shapes of the teddy bear and motorcycle still recognizable after being converted to a low-poly 3-D render style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear and motorcycle maintain their fundamental shapes and are clearly identifiable. The teddy bear has its recognizable plush form, and the motorcycle retains realistic features like the wheels and handlebars. The outlines and significant parts of both objects are well-preserved, indicating they are rendered in a style that still allows for easy recognition.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the teddy bear and motorcycle surfaces show details such as the woolly texture of the teddy bear and the metallic and rubber parts of the motorcycle. These details are intact and do not appear overly simplified. The edited image presents a realistic rendering that keeps important surface characteristics visible.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear and motorcycle are proportioned realistically. The motorcycle's dimensions, like the length of the wheels and the body, match a real motorcycle's structure, and the teddy bear fits naturally upon it without exaggerated or disproportionate scaling.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear is seated on the motorcycle in a manner that suggests it is genuinely interacting with the vehicle. Its posture is adjusted to mimic one who is riding, with legs positioned correctly and hands on the handlebars. This indicates a natural seating and realistic interaction.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

The lighting and shadows appear consistent across all elements, and there are no visible discrepancies or artifacts that would indicate a mismatch. The scenery and objects fit together believably within the context of the image.",
