    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the sinks and cabinets accurately depicted without any broken or warped shapes in both the top-down and angled side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a schematic representation of a sink and cabinet setup. The lines and shapes are straight and consistent, which indicates that the depiction is accurate. The schematic nature of the image suggests it is designed to present the plumbing and cabinet structure without the effect of perspective or natural curvature, common in real-world objects. Therefore, based solely on this representation where the lines are clear and unbroken, the depiction can be considered accurate.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the shadows and light reflections on the countertop, mirrors, and cabinetry appear natural and consistent with the lighting sources in both the top-down and angled side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presentation is more schematic and lacks realistic shadows or reflections. The nature of schematic drawings tends to omit shading and complex light interactions to focus purely on the object design. Therefore, compared with realistic depictions, the absence of shadows and light reflections in Image B is expected and logical for its format.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the texture of the marble countertop and the finish of the white cabinetry remain clear and authentic in both the top-down and angled side views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is a schematic representation that simplifies the texture and finish details to highlight structural and design aspects, rather than realistic textures or finishes. Unlike Image A which shows realistic marble texturing and cabinet finish, Image B presents a uniform design without surface detail, typical of schematics aimed at clarity over authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the faucets and fixtures proportionate and correctly positioned relative to the sink basins in both the top-down and angled side views without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucets and fixtures are shown in simplified schematic form. They appear proportionate to the sinks and are symmetrically positioned, which aligns with common schematic design principles aiming for clarity and proportional accuracy. This representation is typical in design schematics to ensure understanding of layout without distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the layout of the top-down view and angled side view logically arranged and spaced to facilitate easy interpretation of the sink structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a clear showcase of the sink and faucet setup from multiple angles. The arrangement considers top-down and angled side views systematically to illustrate the structure of sinks and cabinets. This allows easy logical interpretation by presenting different perspectives that adhere to a descriptive design approach.",
