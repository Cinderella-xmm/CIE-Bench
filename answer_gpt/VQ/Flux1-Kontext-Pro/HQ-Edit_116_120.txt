    "Question": "Q1: Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical glass dome is clearly visible, encasing the sandcastle entirely. The dome appears smooth and free from seams or distortions. The sandcastle inside can be viewed without difficulty, indicating that there are no incorrect light refractions affecting visibility through the dome. This analysis is supported by the clarity and sharpness with which the details of the sandcastle can be observed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the base appears to have a deep brown color suggesting mahogany. The texture appears smooth yet indicative of polished wood. The thickness throughout is consistent, and it supports the dome proportionally without any visible distortion. Its design looks balanced with respect to the dome and sandcastle, suggesting appropriate scaling.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle inside the glass dome showcases clear and well-defined architectural details, like towers and staircases. The glittering grains are visible but do not overshadow these details, indicating that they are evenly distributed and not obtrusive. This allows the fine details of the sandcastle to remain visible and distinct.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, seashells are placed at the base surrounding the sandcastle. They appear to be sharply defined, indicating no pixelation. The seashells are small enough that they do not compete with the primary focus, the sandcastle, ensuring appropriate scale and clarity without unnatural edge artifacts. This suggests attention to detail in maintaining quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
    "explanation": "The plaque on the base in Image B reads 'Empire of the Shores' and is legible and clearly inscribed. It appears to be securely attached to the base, with its surface showing a matte finish. There is no excessive shine or glare, and the texture appears consistent with a matte finish, indicating that it matches the rest of the materials in appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the sandcastle and surrounding elements exhibit a matte finish. This uniform application minimizes any excessive shine or reflection which is consistent across the image. There are no discernible areas where the finish abruptly changes, indicating a consistent treatment of materials.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
    "explanation": "The sandcastle in Image B presents symmetrically and geometrically coherent structures such as towers, arches, and staircases. All these features appear intact, with no apparent bending, stretching, or missing pieces. This suggests careful attention to maintaining the integrity of the design, ensuring the architectural harmony is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
