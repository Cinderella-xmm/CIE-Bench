    "Question": "Q1: Does the stone-like texture applied to the mountain's surface exhibit uniformity and natural variation in roughness, without visible artifacts like repeating patterns or abrupt transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stone-like texture covering the mountain is part of the fantastical creature design, giving the entire scene a natural mountainous appearance. The surface displays a stone-like quality with a rough texture that appears consistent throughout. There are no visible repeating patterns or abrupt transitions, contributing to a uniform look across the surface. It resembles a natural geological formation, enhanced for the creature theme without detracting from its realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the rock-carved eyes positioned symmetrically and proportionally on the mountain’s peak, with realistic depth and integration into the terrain, avoiding floating or misplaced features?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the eyes are part of the creature's face and are set into the mountain’s peak, appearing integrated with the structure. The positioning is symmetrical to the face features, proportional in size, contributing to the realistic portrayal of the creature. Their depth and integration into the terrain give the impression that they are carved, avoiding any visual conflict like floating or misplaced elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the wing-like ridges extend from the mountain’s sides in a way that follows natural geological lines and does not introduce sharp, broken, or impossible angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wing-like structures seem to protrude naturally from the mountain’s sides as part of the creature’s design. The ridges are curved and flow organically, echoing the mountain’s geological contours. The absence of sharp angles or breaks ensures that they appear as an extended feature rather than an abrupt addition that defies geological logic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the limbs of the creature integrated with the tree silhouettes in a way that avoids visual conflicts such as overlapping branches appearing behind solid limbs or disconnected joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the creature interact with the environment seamlessly. The integration is managed in such a way that the limbs appear to extend from the base of the mountain, blending with the landscape. There is no disruption or disconnection with surrounding tree silhouettes as the design maintains the creature’s solidity while allowing trees to coexist without visual overlap or conflict.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the luminous veins emit a soft glow that blends with the blue and pink hues of the sky, without creating bright halos, sharp edges, or overexposed areas?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the creature with luminous veins that give off a gentle glow. The light emitted blends harmoniously with the sky’s colors, including blues and pinks. This integration avoids any harsh contrasts or sharp edges, maintaining visual softness and without creating overexposed regions or bright halos which would detract from the image’s cohesion and ambient beauty.",
    "answer": "Yes"
