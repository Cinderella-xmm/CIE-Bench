      "question": "Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the military ship is recreated into a LEGO model. The proportions and shape of the LEGO ship appear consistent with the typical shape of such ships, with bricks aligned properly, suggesting that the LEGO version maintains its structural integrity and proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO ocean waves in Image B are depicted using white LEGO pieces placed on a blue base representing water. While the waves have a certain blocky characteristic inherent to LEGO, they do mimic a sense of wave motion due to their varying placement and orientation, not appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO accessories on the boat deck are consistent with the general scale of LEGO characters and other elements. Although there is no character in the image to compare directly, the elements appear to be correctly scaled for such a model environment.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO ship is positioned on a shelf. The shelf appears structurally sound, and the image presents appropriate shadows and depth cues, suggesting a coherent spatial setup.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO ship model does not show any visible artifacts such as jagged lines or misaligned bricks. The construction appears cohesive, with all pieces fitting together smoothly.",
