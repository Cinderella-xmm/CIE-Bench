    "Question": "Q1: Does the dancer's silhouette retain natural body proportions and smooth contours without distorted limbs or misshapen joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's silhouette maintains natural body proportions and has smooth contours. The arms, torso, and legs appear well-proportioned and follow the natural anatomical structure of a human body. The limbs are gracefully posed, reflecting a typical dance posture without any signs of distortion or unrealistic angles, indicating careful attention to maintaining a realistic representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the ruffles of the red dress transformed into flame-like swirls with smooth gradients and consistent lighting, avoiding jagged edges or disjointed shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the red dress with ruffles that resemble flame-like swirls. These swirls have smooth gradients and consistent lighting that enhance the fiery appearance of the dress without any jagged edges or disjointed shapes. The continuity and fluidity in the ruffle design contribute to the illusion of fire, fulfilling the requirement for a seamless transformation from fabric to flame.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the golden crescent moon reflection on the ground aligned with the position of the moon in the sky and does it follow realistic light reflection patterns on the tiled surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict a clear reflection of the golden crescent moon on the ground. The focus is rather on highlighting the dancer and her dress with glowing effects on the ground, which suggests that realistic reflection of the moon may not be intended. Without any evidence of a moon reflection on the tiled surface, the alignment or realistic light reflection pattern cannot be confirmed.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the starry night sky border blend seamlessly with the main sky background without visible edges, repeated patterns, or unnatural star clustering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the border around the image has a decorative design rather than a continuation of the starry sky. While the background itself transitions smoothly with consistent star distribution, the border as a separate decorative element doesn't interfere with the main sky background. As such, the blend refers more to the styling choice rather than an attempt at a seamless transition from border to sky.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the dancerâ€™s raised hand show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no missing or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's raised hand is depicted with five fingers that appear clearly defined. The fingers are positioned naturally, showing appropriate joint angles reflecting a graceful dance gesture. There are no missing parts nor are there extra digits; therefore, the anatomical representation of the hand is correct.",
    "answer": "Yes"
