      "question": "Do the golden highlights on the grape clusters follow the natural curvature and lighting direction of the grapes without appearing as separate, overlaid patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the grape clusters appear to follow the natural surface and curvature of the grapes. The integration respects lighting direction, as the highlights maintain a consistent appearance with the expected light interaction on a rounded surface. This suggests no obvious signs of separation or overlay, making them appear naturally illuminated.",

      "question": "Does the twisted vine design of the cane maintain smooth, continuous curves and proportional thickness consistent with a natural vine, without sharp breaks or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cane features a twisted vine design that reveals smoothly flowing curves, supporting the aesthetic of a naturally grown vine. The thickness across the cane is consistent, lacking sudden breaks or irregularities in the design, which contributes to a cohesive and natural presentation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the suit’s fabric with ornate filigree details. These details blend seamlessly with the existing weave pattern of the fabric. There are no visible outlines or layering artifacts, suggesting a refined integration process that maintains the visual uniformity of the fabric texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B positions vineyard-themed symbols strategically in the corner, such as the 'K' and club symbol. Their scale and orientation are carefully balanced to harmonize with the overall composition. This ensures these symbols do not appear misplaced or oversized, maintaining a unified visual theme.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the cane have exactly five fingers with natural positioning, skin texture, and shadowing consistent with the rest of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the cane possesses five well-defined fingers. The positioning reflects natural anatomical structure, with skin texture consistent with the rest of the image. Shadowing is appropriately applied, complementing the lighting scheme and maintaining consistency across the figure.",
