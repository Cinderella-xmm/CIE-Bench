      "question": "Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the tiger's face are delineated with smooth, continuous lines that show uniform thickness throughout, indicative of a high-quality rendering without any pixelation or broken lines. This conveys a clear and well-executed design. My assessment leads to the conclusion that the edges of the tiger’s face are cleanly defined, as there are no visible artifacts or interruptions in the line work.",

      "question": "Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers on the tiger's face. These features appear symmetrically aligned on both sides of the face, complementing the overall structure of the tiger mask. The symmetry and proportional consistency are maintained, supporting the facial aesthetics and design focus of the mask without imbalances.",

      "question": "Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono's layers and panels are distinctly visible and well-defined, with clean separation indicating precise design. There is no evidence of overlapping or floating segments, which suggests that the layering of the kimono's fabric is appropriately carried out, reflecting careful attention to traditional garment styling.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features gold foil elements that blend seamlessly with the floral pattern on the kimono. The gold elements exhibit uniform reflectivity, enhancing the visual appeal without overpowering with harsh highlights. There are no floating fragments, indicating a smooth integration of these elements with the overall design.",

      "question": "Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the alignment of the detachable panels with the natural fold lines and seams is observed to be precise. This alignment assures that the panels are securely attached and do not appear to float or incorrectly intersect with other parts of the garment, which speaks to a high level of design coherence and attention to detail in replicating the traditional attire.",
