    "Question": "Q4: Is the background composed of detailed tapestries with warm earth tones that blend naturally with the figure without visible edges or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is composed of curtains or tapestry-like patterns with warm earth tones. These tones complement the overall warmth of the composition, and there appears to be a natural blend with the foreground elements. There are no visible edges or lighting inconsistencies that would suggest poor compositional integration.
