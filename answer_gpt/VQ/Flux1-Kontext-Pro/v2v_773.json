      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the structural coherence of the apple's original shape without introducing unnatural distortions or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple maintains its overall shape, which is consistent with the natural form of a halved apple. The depiction doesn't show any unusual breaks, distortions, or alterations in the apple's structure; it follows the natural contours of a real fruit, displaying a smooth curved surface and an integral core area. The representation looks organic, without any abrupt changes or breaks, indicating that the structural coherence is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the materials used for the figurine and accessories visually consistent with the One Piece theme and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not depict a figurine or any accessories related to the One Piece theme. Instead, it showcases an apple. Textures appear natural and consistent with what is visually expected of a photographed apple. There are no visible synthetic or unnatural textures conflicting with the theme in question. Therefore, for a hypothetical figurine or accessory related to One Piece, this criteria is not applicable.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the figurine inside the collector's box appear natural and does it avoid any visual inconsistencies or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no figurine depicted nor any collector's box. The entire frame centers around a halved apple placed on a surface without any visible inconsistencies or distortions. Therefore, any assessment regarding figurine placement within a collector’s box doesn’t apply to this image.",

      "question": "Does the figurine display detailed craftsmanship with realistic textures and no loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image contains a halved apple, not a figurine. The apple in Image B shows a detailed texture consistent with that of a real apple. The textures, such as the wrinkles and coloration, are realistic and resemble what one would observe on an older apple's interior, with no significant loss of detail. However, since there is no figurine present, this question isn’t applicable specifically to figurines in the context of this image.",

      "question": "Are the miniature accessories proportionally correct and physically plausible relative to the figurine and the collector's box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image only features a halved apple and lacks any figurines or miniature accessories. Consequently, there are no proportions to evaluate in terms of physical plausibility relative to a figurine or collector's box. No miniature accessories are present, so this question does not apply.",
