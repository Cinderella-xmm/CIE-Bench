      "question": "Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the figure's raised leg and upper arm, the lines depicted show a continuous and smooth curvature. This is a common representation of graceful poses similar to yoga or ballet movements, where smoothness of form is emphasized. There are no sharp breaks or disconnected segments seen, indicating a successful portrayal of fluid motion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the figure's clothing and the surrounding environment (sky, sand, water) unified in tone, with no abrupt shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases colors that blend harmoniously across different elements. The warm tones of the sky are complemented by the neutral colors in the sand and water, while the figure's clothing, in darker hues, does not clash but rather fits well within the environmental color scheme, ensuring a visually pleasing composition without abrupt transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angle and curve of the neck relative to the torso are drawn in a manner consistent with natural human flexibility, reflecting yoga-like postures. The extended arms are illustrated with smooth, uninterrupted lines, void of any unnatural kinks or bends, indicating a careful design that respects anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals fine shading consistency across the figure's skin and clothing, demonstrating attention to detail. The absence of pixelation or smeared regions suggests a high-quality rendering where textures are maintained throughout, further enhanced by the gentle gradients that provide depth.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, the hand holding the foot is clearly depicted with five distinct fingers. Each finger shows natural curvature, conforming to realistic hand anatomy, and contacts the foot in a way typical of such a pose. There are no overlapping or missing digits, ensuring a correct representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow beneath the figure aligned with the sun’s position in the sky and does it taper naturally toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows the shadow cast beneath the figure aligns with the direction of sunlight, emanating from the sun positioned behind the figure. This creates a tapered effect toward the horizon, consistent with how shadows behave in natural settings, indicating proper attention to light and shadow accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline of the figure, including the raised leg and arm, is smooth and well-defined without halos, jagged edges, or blending errors. This clean depiction suggests meticulous editing, maintaining high fidelity around the figure's contours, crucial for a polished image.",
