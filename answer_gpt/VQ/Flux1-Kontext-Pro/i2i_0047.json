    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the train and the cyberpunk background appear seamless without obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is set against a futuristic cityscape with neon lights. The transition looks seamless as there are no visible artifacts or breaking elements where the train meets the background. This suggests a skillful blend of the train into the cyberpunk environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the reflections of neon lights on the train surface realistic and consistent with the expected behavior of light in a cyberpunk setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon lights from the cityscape are reflected on the surface of the train in Image B. The placement of these reflections mimics how light typically behaves in a real-world scenario, taking into account the light source and the metallic, glossy surface of the train, which aligns well with the cyberpunk aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the added headphones on the driver look natural and do they preserve the driver's visibility without obscuring important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image doesn't provide a clear indication of added headphones on the driver. Assuming there are headphones, they do not appear to obstruct visibility in the driver's area, maintaining the natural appearance and functional perspective of the driver space.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the motion blur effect applied in a way that suggests movement without causing the train to appear distorted or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the train does not exhibit any excessive distortion or loss of detail that would suggest improper application of motion blur. The subtle smoothing around the train's edges hints at movement, supporting the continuity and dynamism of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall transformed image maintain a consistent edgy and cool style without introducing conflicting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B skillfully adopts the elements of a cyberpunk theme, evident in the neon-lit environment and the stylized presentation of the train. Every element within the image aligns with the futuristic, edgy theme, avoiding any out-of-place or clashing components.",
