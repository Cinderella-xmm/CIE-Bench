      "question": "Does the chibi-style illustration of the dog retain its distinct characteristics without unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is represented through a chibi-style illustration, which simplifies details and features a cartoon-like design. This approach focuses on essential characteristics of the subject without overly emphasizing textures and details. The visual cues reflect a consistent representation that aligns with the chibi aesthetic, where simplicity and stylization are more typical than intricate realism. The dog's shape and features are clear and recognizable, reflecting that the image doesn't lose fine details despite the simplicity of the style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bold white outline around the illustration enhance visual clarity without disrupting structural coherence or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white outline around the illustration in Image B serves to demarcate the image boundaries and enhance contrast with the background. In chibi-style or sticker designs, such outlines are common as they bolster visibility and differentiate the image from the surrounding environment. The outline maintains the integrity of each object, including the dog, bench, and items on the bench, providing clear separation from the background without disrupting the coherence or introducing any visual artifacts.",

      "question": "Do the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain structural consistency and visual credibility in their minimalist flat design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "These objects in Image B are designed with a minimalist flair, reducing elements to flat, essential shapes without losing their identity. The bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag retain recognizable features that communicate their function and form reliably in a simplified form. This type of design prioritizes structure and function, allowing each aspect to be clearly visualized in an abstract manner while maintaining its logical appearance within the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the extension of the dog and bench slightly beyond the circular frame preserve natural appearance and avoid distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and bench extend slightly beyond the circular frame. This choice enhances dynamics within the composition by allowing elements to interact with the boundaries authentically. Such design decision does not cause distortion or artificial stretching; rather, it maintains a coherent and natural representation in the context of sticker design where partial overlap with boundaries can emphasize certain aspects of the objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transparent background maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sticker style in Image B continues with a transparent background surrounding the white outline. This design choice accentuates the illustrated subjects and emphasizes its sticker-like quality, presenting a purposeful and deliberate visual appearance without impacting authenticity or realism within its artistic context. Transparent backgrounds are typical to stickers as they allow flexibility in application without imposing on the underlying surface.",
