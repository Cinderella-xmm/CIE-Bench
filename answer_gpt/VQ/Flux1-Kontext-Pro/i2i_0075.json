      "question": "Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture on the side of the cat maintains a consistent appearance with the fur on the front part of the cat. The texture appears smooth and natural, without any visible unnatural artifacts or discrepancies. The consistency in fur texture can be attributed to the uniform lighting and the natural grooming of the fur, which is typical in fluffy cats like this one.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's front and side views are displayed in a split format, and both views appear proportionally aligned. There are no signs of distortion or overlapping artifacts between the two views. The alignment is achieved by maintaining the natural dimensions and size proportions of the cat in both perspectives, which is critical for realistic portrayal in a split-image format.",

      "question": "Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail in both the front and side views. There is no visible blurring or artifacts affecting these parts, indicating a high-quality representation. These characteristics are critical for maintaining the integrity of features that are central to a cat's appearance and expression.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B splits the cat into front and side views without directly merging the images, so there is no specific area where the two views need to transition naturally. The alignment is such that the viewer sees two distinct perspectives side by side without overlapping intersections. Thus, there is no issue with broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections because the views are presented separately.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall posture and positioning of the cat remain plausible and natural. Even though the image is split into two perspectives, each view presents a plausible natural pose for a cat resting comfortably. There is no evidence of unnatural bending or stretching of limbs, suggesting careful alignment and accurate depiction of the cat's posture.",
