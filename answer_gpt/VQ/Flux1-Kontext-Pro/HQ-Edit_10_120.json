      "question": "Does the fabric of the qipao display a uniform silk-like watercolor texture without visible seams, blocky patches, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the qipao is illustrated with a texture that resembles a uniform silk-like finish. The pattern of the floral design is consistent, with no apparent seams, blocky patches, or inconsistent shading visible.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the floral patterns are detailed and appear to have been well-integrated into the dress's design, there is no indication of gold foil accents that show reflections or align with the realistic behavior of how gold would typically reflect light. The colors and shading are more watercolor-like without metallic reflections, indicative of artistic choice rather than realism in its depiction of gold.",
