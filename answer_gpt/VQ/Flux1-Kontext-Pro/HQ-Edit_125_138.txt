    "Question": "Q1: Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the dress are presented in a line-drawn or sketched style, as opposed to the detailed and vibrant colors observed in Image A. This sketched style inherently lacks the digital artifacts like pixelation or jagged edges, which are more common in digital images with detailed patterns. The hand-drawn appearance suggests an intentional stylistic choice, thus eliminating the occurrence of pixelation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the temple is presented with a line-drawn appearance. The architectural lines are clear and seem to be accurately aligned from level to level, maintaining the pyramid-like structure. Comparing with Image A, which shows the actual photo of the temple, the drawn version reflects the same symmetrical and tiered structure, indicating accurate depiction without any visible distortions or missing elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the guardian statues are mirrored in their positioning and details, much like their counterparts in Image A. They maintain symmetrical alignment relative to the central pathway leading to the temple. The illustration replicates the positioning as observed in the original, indicating identical size and pose with respect to the temple axis.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do both of the dancer’s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B, the line-drawn depiction of the dancer shows both hands with five fingers each. The contours are smooth, and the fingers are evenly spaced, avoiding any digital deformation or additional digits that would indicate an error in the depiction. This aligns with the natural presentation seen in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'BALI'S MAJESTIC LEGACY' is positioned at the top of the image above the main visual elements — the dancer, temple, and guardian statues. This placement prevents any overlap with the key features of the image, ensuring readability and a lack of visual clutter, contrasting with potentially less strategic placements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
