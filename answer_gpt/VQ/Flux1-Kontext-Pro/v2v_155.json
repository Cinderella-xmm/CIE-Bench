      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style representation of the golden car maintain its natural texture and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden car within the frame is depicted with realistic textures such as the metallic shine and intricate details like the design of the wheels and the car body moldings. The presence of shadows and the reflection on the car further supports its natural texture. These visual elements demonstrate that the car maintains an authentic appearance without any visible distortions or unnatural artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the 3D chibi-style golden car preserved, avoiding any distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the car appear consistent with a real model, with symmetric alignment of components, intact geometric shapes like the wheels, and evenly proportioned body structure. The absence of unusual sizing or shape inconsistencies supports the notion that the car's proportions and physical rationality are preserved without distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style golden car retain its essential features and style, reflecting the overall sense of reality and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The essential features of the car in Image B, such as the contours, design elements like the headlights and door outlines, and the reflective metallic finish, contribute to an overall realistic and natural appearance. The car's style and representation suggest it retains the key characteristics that portray a recognizable real-world automotive model without stylized abstraction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the human hand grasping the edges of the frame appear natural with proper texture and detail, without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human hand in Image B is depicted with a natural color, visible skin texture, and accurate articulation around the fingernails and the grip on the frame. The presence of subtle shading enhances the hand's natural appearance, and no signs of unnatural artifacts are visible, indicating that the hand is presented realistically and credibly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the human hand and the emerging 3D chibi-style golden car visually credible and structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition of the human hand holding the frame and the positioning of the car within the frame work together cohesively. The spatial arrangement seems logical, indicating a structured connection between the hand, frame, and contained objects (car and toothbrush) which collectively create a coherent visual scene without misalignment or visual imbalance.",
