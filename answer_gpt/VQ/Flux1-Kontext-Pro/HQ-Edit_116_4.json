      "question": "Are the transformed lanterns now depicted as balloons with consistent spherical shapes, smooth surfaces, and realistic lighting effects that match their surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lanterns have been transformed drastically from their original form in Image A, where they appear as more traditional lanterns with intricate details and textures. In Image B, they are depicted as more cartoonish balloons with consistent spherical shapes and smoother surfaces, which lack the detail of the original lanterns. The lighting effects on these balloons match the overall bright and colorful style of the transformed image, and they integrate well into the edited environment that mimics a stylized artwork or a card.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono's patterns are exaggerated with vivid colors and stylized designs characteristic of artworks or cards. The patterns maintain continuity and flow, suggesting skillful artistic integration. While not mimicking real fabric, they follow a cohesive artistic theme aligned with the overall aesthetic of the edited image. There are no obvious digital artifacts or breaks in the patterns, indicating careful editing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the girlâ€™s face retain anatomically plausible proportions, including correctly shaped eyes, nose, and mouth, with no signs of stretching, misalignment, or incorrect number of fingers on her hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analysis excludes the blurred area but focuses on proportion details visible otherwise, such as the body's posture and the hands. The edited image stylizes these elements significantly while preserving anatomical plausibility. The hands visible in the image do not present any unusual number of fingers or distortions and align with the stylized artistic concept. Overall character depiction suggests artistic expression but adheres to basic anatomical proportions.",
