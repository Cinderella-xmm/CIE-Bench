    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the green field appear to float above the starry background with clean, continuous edges and no visible distortions or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green field is depicted with a clear separation from the starry sky in the background. Its edges are continuous and well-defined, which creates a surreal but coherent visual of the field seemingly floating over the backdrop. There are no distortions or broken geometries observed, suggesting an intentional artistic choice.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the yellow and red flowers vividly colored but free from unnatural texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers, both yellow and red, are indeed vividly colored, aligning with a whimsical and vibrant style. There are no visible texture artifacts or color fringing around their petals, which indicates a clean and polished representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the apple-shaped object in the sky significantly larger than the tree and properly lit with consistent shading and texture, resembling a real fruit rather than a flat graphic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the apple-shaped objects are spread around the tree rather than in the sky and they appear properly lit with consistent shading, which gives them a three-dimensional appearance, resembling real, albeit surrealistically oversized, fruit. The object's texture and shading are consistent, making it appear realistic within the context of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the insect figures (bee and butterfly) stylized but still identifiable, with smooth contours and no anatomical deformities or fragmented parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the insect figures, such as the bee and butterfly, are stylized in a whimsical and playful manner. They are easily identifiable and have smooth contours without anatomical deformities or fragmented parts, fitting with the overall surreal style of the image.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the tree replaced by a hollow, angular geometric form with clean lines and internal voids, matching the surreal style without appearing fragmented or physically impossible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree is depicted atop a structure with visible hollows and an artificial-looking base, which matches the surreal aesthetic. This structure has clean lines and internal voids, but still maintains a degree of plausibility within the surreal context, lacking any fragmented or broken appearance.",
