        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is depicted with simplified features typical of chibi art, characterized by a smaller head and a rounded body. The body proportions seem in line with chibi art conventions where the body is notably shortened, and the limbs are simplified, giving a cute and cartoonish look. Common knowledge about chibi art confirms that the observed proportions align well with this style.",
