      "question": "Does the crack on the Axe container appear natural and maintain the structural integrity of the container without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the container is visually cracked open revealing a nebula inside. The crackâ€™s appearance is jagged and sharp, typical of a forceful breach rather than natural wear. Such a drastic crack would compromise the structural integrity of any container, especially a plastic one like that from Axe products. Thus, the structural integrity is not maintained. Logically, given the brutality of the crack, visible artifacts are likely even if not directly visible in the image.",

      "question": "Does the miniature nebula inside the container blend naturally with the interior of the container and maintain visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebula adds a surreal and fantastical element to Image B. Inside a mundane container like those used for styling putty, a nebula doesn't suddenly appear; nebulae exist in vast cosmic scales. Therefore, while visually appealing, the nebula doesn't blend naturally with what would be expected inside such a container, compromising visual plausibility.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cosmic dust and gases within the nebula detailed and textured, avoiding any unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays cosmic dust and gases with detailed textures and rich colors. The bright, glowing center, surrounded by swirling gases and dust particles, is visually coherent without obvious pixelation or artifacts, achieving a smooth and high-quality depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the size and shape of the nebula fit naturally within the container's opening, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nebula's size fills the container's cracked opening in Image B with its swirling energy extending outward. From a structural standpoint, an element like a nebula is not bound by physical confines, so its fittingly expansive nature contradicts the notion of a 'natural fit' within a conventional consumer product like a container, impacting structural consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fiery red and energetic pink hues in the nebula consistent with the label design and contribute to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nebula's fiery reds and pinks visually resonate with the colors present in the label design seen in Image A. This consistency in hues across both images visually connects the interior nebula to the outer design, providing a harmonious color scheme despite the fantastical elements.",
