      "question": "Is the watch communicator on the plaid tie positioned naturally within the fabric, with consistent color, texture, and lighting that match the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch communicator appears embedded in the plaid tie. However, the position seems slightly awkward and does not fully blend with the fabric's texture and color. The lighting and shadows don't align perfectly with the rest of the tie, indicating a lack of integration. In Image A, there is no such watch communicator on the tie, which further suggests that this element was edited into Image B and lacks natural blending with the surrounding material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the camera lens embedded in the emblem on the right suit’s lapel aligned with the pattern and fabric, showing no gaps, misaligned edges, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the camera lens seems to be fixed in the emblem on the lapel, but its integration into the fabric appears less than seamless. Slight misalignments in edge detail and unnatural highlights distract from a coherent appearance. By comparing Image B with Image A, where no such detail exists, it's clear that this is an additional edit that does not convincingly blend with the emblem or fabric.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the thought bubbles and dialogue text clearly separated from the characters’ faces and clothing, with clean lines and no overlap or distortion of nearby features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thought bubbles and dialogue text are positioned adequately, separate from any clothing or characters' features. The bubbles have clean lines and do not interfere or overlap with the characters' clothing, which indicates a careful placement to ensure clarity and readability, unimpeded by surrounding features.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the characters’ necks and shoulders retain natural proportions and smooth contours, without stretched, compressed, or fragmented shapes after anthropomorphization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necks and shoulders of the characters appear to maintain natural proportions without noticeable distortion. The contours are smooth, lacking any signs of stretching, compression, or fragmentation. There are no visible deformities or editing artifacts around these areas, which suggests that the anthropomorphization process retained the natural shape and flow of these body parts.",

      "question": "Is the grassy field and sky background free from distortion, noise, or color inconsistencies that suggest digital manipulation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grassy field and sky background appear consistent with natural photography. There are no visible distortions or noise that would indicate digital manipulation. The colors remain consistent and vibrant, and the details of the background, such as shadows and light spots on the grass, appear intact and unchanged.",
