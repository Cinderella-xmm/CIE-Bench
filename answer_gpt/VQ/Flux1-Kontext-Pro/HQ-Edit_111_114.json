    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the man and the components of the scooter proportionally coherent and free from geometric distortion such as elongated arms, bent knees, or misaligned wheels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the man's limbs appear balanced and coherent, suggesting natural human anatomy without visible distortions. His arms and legs sit comfortably in relation to the scooterer, and the scooter components, including the wheels, appear appropriately aligned without any signs of warping or misalignment. This conclusion is drawn from the visual cues and standard proportionality typically observed in well-rendered illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sepia tones cover all areas evenly without visible color banding, blotchy patches, or loss of detail in textures like fabric, stone, or foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia tone is consistent throughout the image, providing an even coverage with a nostalgic aesthetic. The textures of fabric, stone, and other elements appear to retain their detail, allowing for clear depictions without noticeable banding or blotchy patches. This suggests a well-applied sepia filter that maintains clarity and detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the edges of the image softly degraded with a smooth transition into white, without abrupt lines or visible masking artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the edges transition smoothly into a lighter shade, creating a gentle frame effect characteristic of soft vignette styles or aged paper effects. There are no abrupt lines or masking artifacts observed, which indicates an intentional design for soft degradation at the boundaries.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the art-nouveau frame surround the image without overlapping or cutting through the man’s face, scooter, or any background structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the art-nouveau frame is designed to border the illustration neatly. It does not intrude upon or intersect with key elements such as the man's face, scooter, or the background. This suggests careful positioning and alignment of the frame relative to these objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the blank writing area located directly beneath the image, aligned horizontally, and free from warping or interference with the scooter’s base or ground line?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a designated blank area below the illustration that is horizontally aligned. There is a clear separation from the base of the scooter and the ground line, indicating that the text area placement is intentional and free from any graphical interference.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the parchment texture appear uniformly across the image without causing blurring, ghosting, or obscuration of fine details like the man’s beard or window shutters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment texture in Image B provides a consistent background surface. It does not negatively affect the visibility of intricate details such as the man's beard or architectural features like window shutters, suggesting a balanced use of texture alongside the clarity of finer design elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the postcards arranged in a stack with realistic shadows, overlapping edges, and twine wrapped around them in a way that suggests physical binding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a stack arrangement of postcards where the edges overlap subtly. The presence of shadows and twine wrapping around the edges implies a three-dimensional binding effect, reflecting physical properties of stacked postcards.",
