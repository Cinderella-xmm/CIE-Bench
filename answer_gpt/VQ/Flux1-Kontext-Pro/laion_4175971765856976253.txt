    "Question": "Q1: Does the isometric packaging box have consistent edges, proper depth cues, and accurate alignment with the toy figures without visible warping or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box has clear and consistent edges, evidenced by straight lines that define the box's structure. The depth cues are proper, indicated by the shadows and the 3D appearance of the box, aligning well with the contained toy figures. There are no visible signs of warping or misalignment, suggesting that the editing maintains the realism and proportionality between the box and the figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the chibi-style figures inside the box proportionally consistent with typical chibi design rules (e.g., large heads, short limbs) and do they retain identifiable features of the original car and robot?",
    "explanation": "The chibi-style figures in Image B have large heads and short limbs, which is characteristic of chibi design. They maintain identifiable features from the original car and robot, such as the color scheme and facial elements, despite their exaggerated proportions. This indicates consistent adherence to chibi design rules while retaining recognizable characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base clearly defined, properly scaled, and positioned without floating or clipping through other elements inside the box?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base are individually distinguishable and properly fit into the context of the packaging. The scaling appears appropriate relative to each component and the toy figures, and there is no visual indication of these items floating or clipping with other objects. Everything is placed logically, contributing to a tidy presentation in the box.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the external surfaces of the car and robot exhibit consistent metallic textures with natural highlights and reflections, without visible artifacts like blotches or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The surfaces of the car and robot in Image B have smooth, consistent metallic textures, matching the glossy appearance expected from such materials. The highlights and reflections appear natural, and there are no apparent artifacts such as blotches or jagged edges that would otherwise indicate poor image quality or editing inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the reflections and lighting on the showcase surface consistent with the direction of light and the materials of the figures, without unnatural glare or shadow mismatches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection and lighting patterns on the showcase surface correlate well with the direction of light, as seen in the highlights on the figures. The lighting is coherent with the shine on the car and robot figures, and there are no discrepancies such as unnatural glare or mismatched shadows, ensuring a realistic integration with the surrounding light environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
