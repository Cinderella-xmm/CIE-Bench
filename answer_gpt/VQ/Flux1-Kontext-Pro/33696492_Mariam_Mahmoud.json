      "question": "Are the wing-shaped shelves formed from the original bookshelves smooth and continuous without jagged edges or missing segments, and do they feature leaf textures that blend naturally with the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelves are transformed into wing shapes that look smooth and continuous without visible jagged edges or missing segments. The textures appear to be naturally blending with the wood, as they resemble feathers, giving an impression of a seamless integration with the natural theme of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hanging fungi occupy the same positions as the original lamps, have rounded caps and stems resembling real mushrooms, and display a soft glow without visible artifacts or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanging fungi appear to occupy similar positions as the original lamps in Image A. They feature rounded caps and stems that resemble real mushrooms and emit a soft, warm glow. This glow does not show any visible artifacts or unnatural gradients, maintaining a consistent and natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the chair and stool replacements shaped like natural rocks with uneven surfaces and moss coverage that follows realistic growth patterns, and do they retain a size suitable for human seating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chairs and stools are replaced with objects that resemble natural rocks. They have uneven surfaces and show moss coverage that matches realistic growth patterns, giving them a natural look. However, they seem to be smaller and less accommodating for human seating compared to the well-defined chairs and stools in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the book-to-bird transformations show complete bird bodies with defined heads, wings, and tails, and do the feathers contain readable text fragments arranged in a natural pattern without distorted letters or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the original books on the shelves in Image A have been transformed into birds. These birds display complete bodies with intricate details of heads, wings, and tails. However, while the textures on their feathers are detailed, they do not display readable text fragments naturally; rather, the emphasis is on the bird form without incorporating text in a visually coherent or readable manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the entwined branches forming the ceiling connected and interlaced in a natural way without gaps or floating segments, and do they cast shadow patterns that align with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling is formed by entwined branches that appear to be naturally connected and interlaced. These branches cast shadow patterns that align with the light source direction, similar to the shadow play seen from the ceiling in Image A. The placement and interaction with light seem cohesive, enhancing the overall naturalistic design.",
