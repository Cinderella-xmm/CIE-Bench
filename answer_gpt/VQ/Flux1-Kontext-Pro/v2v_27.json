      "question": "Do the wombat's eyes appear naturally large and expressive without any distortion or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes of the wombat in each pose retain a consistent, rounded shape that is befitting of a caricatured style. The absence of distortion or unnatural artifacts suggests that the design maintains clarity and the intention of large, expressive eyes, which is characteristic of illustrating anthropomorphic animals. This is reflective of a natural artistic choice rather than a flaw, confirming that the eyes are naturally large and expressive.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the poses reflect a consistent style across all six stickers, showing a range of emotions from sitting with a relaxed pose to gesturing with a paw or holding a belly.

Each pose is structurally coherent and stylistically uniform.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Hawaiian shirt in Image B shows clear floral patterns with consistent color and shape, mimicking typical designs. The straw hat retains visible weave patterns and shading that illustrate its texture effectively.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each sticker is distinctly separated by a margin of white space that provides sufficient visual breathing room. This ensures that each design stands out clearly, avoiding any sense of clutter, which aids in visual clarity.
