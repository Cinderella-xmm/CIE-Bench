    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes and mouth are stylized to fit a cartoon theme. The eyes are larger and more expressive than the ones in Image A, and the mouth appears more simplistic. These differences indicate a deliberate shift to cartoon aesthetics, adding charm and character. While the design does change, it maintains similar proportions relative to the face and head structure, respecting the original plush's placement, albeit in a stylized manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lasso is rounded and appears elevated above the horse's head, demonstrating the perception of motion. It is positioned such that it does not intersect or clip through the horse’s body, supporting the idea of a dynamic and energetic scene consistent with playful narratives involving cowboys or horse adventures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cacti and saloon buildings are stylized but correctly follow perspective rules with alignment towards an implied horizon. Their shadows align with the general sunlight direction, creating a coherent and believable environment that complements the western theme.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur and plastic base are simplified due to the cartoon style, but intentionally so to align with the thematic image transformation. The fur appears uniform and the base's structure is clear enough to denote their components, while not possessing the intricate texture seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is placed prominently at the top, designed to grab attention. It is carefully positioned without overlapping any of the panels or primary visual elements, ensuring clarity and enhancing the thematic presentation.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure and design of the rocking base and legs maintain key features corresponding to Image A, albeit in a stylized cartoon form. The proportional changes serve to emphasize character and expression rather than mechanical accuracy, yet they are recognizable and maintain visual linkage to their original configuration.",
