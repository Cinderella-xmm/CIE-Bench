    "Question": "Q1: Do the textures and materials of the baseball and glove appear natural and consistent in all three views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the baseball and glove are assessed by observing the details in the leather of the glove, which appears smooth and structured with visible stitching, and the surface of the baseball, which shows typical seams and a slightly rough texture consistent with a real baseball. These features appear natural and consistent across all views within Image B. The glove and baseball's visual details are coherent, resembling what one would expect from authentic sports equipment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the proportions of the baseball and glove accurate and maintain their expected size relationships in all three views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the size of the baseball relative to the glove is consistent with the expected proportions when a baseball is placed inside a glove. The baseball fits comfortably within the glove, as shown in multiple views, which suggests accurate proportional relationships observed in real life where a baseball should fit snugly into the pocket of the glove.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there any visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, around the baseball or glove in all three views?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the edges of both the baseball and glove appear smooth and well-defined without any noticeable jagged edges or unnatural blending issues. The contours of the objects are clear, and the transitions between different elements in the image, such as where the baseball meets the glove and grass, are seamless.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove look natural and consistent with the lighting conditions in all three views?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights are evaluated by noting how light interacts with the glove and baseball. The highlights on the leather of the glove and the surface of the baseball are consistent with a soft lighting source, while shadows align with expectations given the apparent light direction. The lighting looks uniform and naturally highlights the curvature and texture of both objects in all perspectives shown.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the composition and layout in each of the three views (top, side, sectional) logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner?",
    "explanation": "The compositional arrangement in Image B places the glove and baseball in a natural setting on grass, with each view logically capturing different perspectives (front, angled side, and slightly more open side) that are consistent with how these objects would be viewed in real scenarios. The objects are centered and proportionally laid out, making the scenes visually credible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
