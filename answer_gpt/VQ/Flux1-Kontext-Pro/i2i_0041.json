      "question": "Do the chibi sheep maintain their original interaction pose by the railing in the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three entities are depicted as chibi characters standing closely together, facing forward, and appearing more anthropomorphic with scarves and beanies. They are not positioned by a railing. By contrast, Image A shows actual sheep goats near a fencing structure. The chibi characters do not maintain the original interaction pose with a railing as seen in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the winter accessories (scarves, earmuffs, gloves) added to the chibi sheep free from unnatural textures and retain fine details similar to the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the winter accessories such as scarves and beanies appear smooth and consistent with the flat, cartoonish style of the chibi characters. There's no indication of unnatural textures; instead, the items are seamlessly integrated into the overall design, matching the chibi art style.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and poses of the chibi sheep appear physically plausible and coherent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and poses of the chibi sheep are exaggerated to fit a cartoon style, which is typical of chibi art that features larger heads, shorter bodies, and simple poses. While this differs from realistic proportions, it is coherent within the context of the chibi art style, where such proportions are common and plausible.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the flat, cartoonish style conversion of the sheep maintain a sense of realism without introducing obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is intentionally stylized in a cartoonish manner, following the chibi art aesthetic, which inherently lacks realism but is consistent and free from distortions or errors. The style does not introduce unnatural artifacts within the context of its creative representation, maintaining overall aesthetic consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, including the chibi sheep and their accessories, preserve visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's composition maintains visual credibility within the context of a chibi art style, aligning with expectations for such designs. The layout is coherent, with the characters grouped together naturally, and accessories like scarves and beanies adding to the visual narrative without disrupting the structure.",
