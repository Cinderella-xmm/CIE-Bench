    "Question": "Q1: Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The tabletop in Image B displays a metallic sheen and features detailed gear engravings. The surface of the tabletop is clearly defined and does not exhibit any blurred or jagged edges, which indicates high-quality rendering of the metallic texture and engravings. The use of lighting and shading enhances the visibility of the engravings, presenting a realistic metallic appearance. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge of materials and textures, the surface shows consistent metallic sheen and engravings.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
    "explanation": "The limbs in Image B appear to be symmetrically arranged around the central column and seem proportionately scaled. The design features clearly defined joints, and the mechanical arms do not show any signs of being bent or broken, maintaining a consistent structural integrity. These visual cues suggest intentional design symmetry which is common in engineered objects. Therefore, the limbs are symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled, with intact segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there are no visible steam vents along the central column. Therefore, there is no basis to evaluate their spacing or alignment relative to the rest of the design. In the context of this mechanical aesthetic, steam vents would typically be visible and integrated into the design. Since no steam vents are observed, they cannot be assessed for even spacing or proper embedding.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
    "explanation": "The base in Image B showcases intact geometric shapes, such as cog patterns and dials, which appear evenly spaced and well-detailed. The machinery elements show no signs of overlapping or incomplete features, reflecting careful attention to mechanical design aesthetics. The consistency of the geometric shapes contributes to the overall symmetrical and functional appearance, which is characteristic of well-crafted mechanical designs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) predominantly features brass tones throughout the structure, with no silver metal visible. The brass and copper accents exhibit a consistent color and reflectivity characteristic of these metals, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts. The uniformity in the metallic color presentation aligns with common knowledge about material properties and reflects realistic rendering of metal accents.",
    "answer": "No"
