      "question": "Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat in Image B is depicted lounging on a settee inside an elaborate shadow box scene. Given the serene and natural posture of the cat, with its body fitted comfortably onto the sofa, the proportions seem natural. The arrangement of the legs, the proportionate size of its head and body, and the relaxed pose suggest correct anatomical structure without any visible distortion such as stretching or compression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the settee features a plush velvet cushion with a floral pattern, and there is detailed wood carving present in its structure. The velvet appears soft and consistent under the lighting, with no visible pixelation or harsh transitions in shading. The wooden parts exhibit natural grain patterns and reflections that match the ambient light, suggesting a high-quality rendering without mismatched seams.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The velvet curtains in Image B are drawn back with a realistic appearance, showcasing gentle fold patterns that indicate gravity. The integration of the curtains into the wooden frame and surrounding backdrop appears seamless, with no visible floating or misalignment. The soft shadows cast by the curtains are consistent with the sceneâ€™s lighting, enhancing their realistic depiction.",

      "question": "Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gilded columns flanking the settee are rendered with correct scaling that fits the shadow box frame and scene. The perspective is accurate, with base and capital details aligning proportionately. Their surface exhibits a reflective quality consistent with metallic materials under ambient lighting. There are no visible artifacts, such as blurring or jagged edges, detracting from the realism.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mouse portraits in Image B are distinct and proportionally sized to fit the intricately designed backdrop. Each frame is correctly aligned and hangs naturally with visible string attachments. The shadows beneath the frames provide depth and realism. No visual glitches or texture errors are detected, indicating careful attention to detail in their rendering.",
