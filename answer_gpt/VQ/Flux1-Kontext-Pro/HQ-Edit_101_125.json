      "question": "Do both hands of the elderly gentleman have exactly five fingers each, with natural spacing and joint alignment consistent with human anatomy?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are visible holding a newspaper. Based on visual cues, both hands appear to show a typical number of fingers and anatomical alignment consistent with human hands, with natural spacing and positioning for gripping an object. Given the clarity and uniformity in depiction, it can be reasoned that both hands have five fingers each, with appropriate spacing and joint alignment.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the newspaper being held by the man appears proportionate to his body size. It spans across his lap and is being held by both hands in a manner that does not indicate any floating or disproportionate size. Considering the perspective and depiction of body proportions, the newspaper seems realistically scaled and supported.",
