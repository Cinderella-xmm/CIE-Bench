    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the arms are highly muscular with pronounced definition, similar to stylized comic or animation characters, where muscular exaggeration is common. The muscle groups are clearly delineated and seem to follow natural contours seen in bodybuilders, with appropriate alignment of joints such as shoulders and elbows. This suggests an understanding of anatomy despite the exaggerated proportions.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the barâ€™s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, colorful icons are visible on the background wall and are intended to resemble stickers or decorations. These icons are not positioned relative to the barbell, but rather to the window panes in the background. The alignment with respect to the barbell's axis is not applicable since they appear independent from it. However, the icons do not appear detached or distorted within their context.",

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror shows a reflection of the character consistent with the expected perspective and angle. The lighting on the character and shadows in the mirror align with the gym lighting, suggesting consistency. The depth and angle correspond with known reflections based on the figure's position to the mirror and light sources.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the calendar strip aligned horizontally along the bottom edge of the panel and sized appropriately to match the scale of the figure and surroundings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a calendar strip is positioned along the bottom of what appears to be a printed panel. It is horizontally aligned in an orderly fashion, matching the layout of a typical wall calendar. The size of the strip is proportionate, taking up reasonable space relative to the overall dimensions of the gym setting and figure within the scene.",
