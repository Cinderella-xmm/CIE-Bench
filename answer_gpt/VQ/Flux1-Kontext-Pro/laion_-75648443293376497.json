    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the leather texture across the backpack's main body appear uniformly consistent in grain, color, and thickness without unnatural seams or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack appears to be made of leather with a consistent grain, color, and thickness. The texture doesn't show any abrupt changes, seams, or patches that break the uniformity, indicating a natural and seamless leather covering throughout the main body of the backpack. This conclusion is based on the observed even coloring and patterning typical of processed, high-quality leather goods.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the buckle surfaces altered to display a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing and realistic light reflection, without deformed shapes or mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buckles have a brass-like appearance, with a warm, golden hue that often characterizes such metals. The finish includes subtle tarnishing, which adds to the sense of realism by mimicking oxidization. The light reflections on the buckles are consistent with their shape and material, avoiding deformations or mismatched highlights. The buckles appear intact and properly integrated with the bag’s design.",

      "question": "Are the travel patches positioned on the side pockets with proper alignment to the stitching and fabric contours, showing no warping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show any visible travel patches on the side pockets to analyze their alignment and relationship with stitching or fabric contours. Therefore, there is no evidence of warping or floating. The question implies an aspect that doesn't visually exist in the image provided.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" text clearly visible on the front flap, properly aligned with the flap’s curvature, and free from jagged edges or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' is prominently visible on the front flap of the backpack. It appears to be well-aligned with the curvature of the flap, maintaining a clear, readable font without any noticeable jagged edges or ghosting effects. The crispness and alignment suggest the design was intentionally placed to complement the backpack's shape.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the compass graphic near the base of the backpack rendered with fine, consistent lines that follow a circular pattern and do not distort the surrounding leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass graphic in Image B is placed near the base of the backpack and is drawn with fine, consistent lines. The lines follow a cohesive circular pattern, characteristic of compass designs, and the graphic integrates smoothly without distorting the leather texture. This consistency indicates a well-rendered element that aligns with the overall aesthetic without causing any distortion.",
