    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the castle icon used for the HOMEPAGE positioned centrally and sized proportionally to fit within the original white rounded rectangle area without overlapping nearby elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle icon is supposed to represent the HOMEPAGE, however, unlike Image A which has a central box containing HOMEPAGE, the castle sits freely in the landscape without a specific bounding area. Its size appears proportionate to its surrounding elements and does not overlap with other icons or objects. The earlier rectangular framing is interpreted as the space it should fill logically.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the connection lines between the HOMEPAGE and main sections (e.g., PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS, ABOUT US) transformed into smooth, winding trails with no broken segments or irregular widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows winding paths connecting different elements akin to the trails seen in fantasy landscapes. These trails are smooth, continuous, and maintain regular widths along their lengths. In comparison to Image A, which had straight logical lines, Image B draws visually appealing connections with curved paths to mimic natural trails.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the icon replacing \"PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS\" clearly visible, properly aligned within the orange rounded rectangle, and appropriately scaled so it doesn't extend beyond the border?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The area for 'PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS' in Image B lacks a direct representation like the orange rectangle seen in Image A. Instead, the destination seems implied within the landscape theme without explicit framing. This implies an artistic reinterpretation rather than a clear boundary setup as seen initially.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the decorative elements (e.g., trees, creatures) placed along the winding trails in gaps between nodes and do they have smooth outlines and consistent coloring without jagged edges or noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B embraces a fairy-tale aesthetic with decorative elements like trees and flowers interspersed alongside the paths. These elements blend artistically in the environment, maintaining smooth outlines and consistent coloring, and show no perceptible jagged edges or visual noise, creating a coherent scenic layout as opposed to Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the text in the blue rounded rectangles (e.g., \"News\", \"Events\") use a consistent, bold, child-friendly font that remains fully contained within the bounds of each shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B foregoes the structured layout of blue rounded rectangles that contains text in Image A. The artistic style in Image B does not replicate any clear presence of such text boxes, hence this transformation doesn't maintain the same framing for text seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the different levels of the site map (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) still visually separable based on color coding or size differences, despite the change in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the site map is stylistically represented with varying elements, but lacks apparent differentiation based on color coding or size differences that were visible in Image A's structured layers. Though the trails suggest hierarchical paths, the levels aren't distinctly separable through color or size.",
