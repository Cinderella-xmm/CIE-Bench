      "question": "Do the anthropomorphic cardinal and blue jay have proportionally correct limbs and body structures that maintain anatomical plausibility without visible deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the cardinal and the blue jay are dressed in Victorian garments, and it can be seen that their arms and legs are dressed as if they were human-like figures. However, this anthropomorphism results in proportions that are not anatomically plausible for the birds since birds typically have wings and different leg structures. Given their human-like attire and our world knowledge that birds do not possess arms and legs in the human sense, the limb proportions differ significantly from a bird's natural anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the Victorian garments worn by the cardinal and blue jay rendered with clear, consistent texture and stitching, free from pixelation, blurring, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cardinal and blue jay in Victorian-style clothing. The garments appear detailed with visible texture resembling fabric, and the stitching is clear and consistent without noticeable pixelation or blurring. The materials seem coherent and plausible for doll-like representations in this anthropomorphic context.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the miniature stage and alcove elements positioned with proper depth and alignment, and do icicles and pine accents adhere to gravitational and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stage and alcove elements are depicted in a wooden box setting with clear divisions. The icicles hang vertically, aligning with gravitational logic. The pine accents are appropriately angled, consistent with natural drooping due to snow weight. Depth and alignment are skillfully executed to create a realistic setting within the miniature scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all miniature seasonal elements (e.g., ornaments, snowflakes) properly scaled, cast realistic shadows, and aligned with the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature elements such as snowflakes and trees in Image B are proportionally scaled to the small diorama setting. The elements cast shadows that align with the lighting, which appears to be coming from above, creating a coherent and realistic visual effect enhancing the depth and immersion of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the split-frame border clean and seamless, with no visible artifacts, distortion, or color bleeding at the boundary between the two scenes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a split-frame as in Image A. Instead, it presents a singular scene with two alcoves having a continuous visual theme without any distinct split-frame borders. Since there's no split-frame border present, the concept of color bleeding or artifacts between two split scenes does not apply.",
