    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is outlined with thick, bold lines which are uniform and continuous, following the natural silhouette of the cat. This type of line is commonly found in stylized and cartoon-like illustrations, which emphasizes the animal's shape without distortion or interruption.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses on the cat’s face are colored with a uniform flat orange, showing no reflection, gradient, or complexity in texture. They maintain the same shape and general position as seen on the cat’s face in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background where the sky, ocean, and sand are rendered in solid color blocks, typical of pop art styles. These areas lack the natural gradient and texture found in Image A, resulting instead in simplistic, flat areas of color.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the harness on the cat is depicted with smooth color fills rather than realistic texture, and the shadows underneath the cat are made of gradient colors. This contrasts with Image A where these elements show more realistic texture and shading.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the overall color scheme is primarily restricted to red, blue, and yellow. The major elements in the image, including the cat, sunglasses, the item resembling a hot dog, and the background, adhere strictly to these colors, making it a stylized primary color palette characteristic of certain art styles.",
