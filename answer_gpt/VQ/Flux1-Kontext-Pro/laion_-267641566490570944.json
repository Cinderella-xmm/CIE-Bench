    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the crystal horns on the dragon head proportionally sized relative to the mountain peak and do they exhibit natural refraction and transparency consistent with crystalline material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Looking at Image B, the dragon features several crystal formations on its head. The size of these crystals appears large when compared to the mountain peaks in the background, suggesting disproportionally oversized horns. In terms of transparency and refraction, these crystal horns reflect light in a way that aligns with how real translucent materials typically behave, showing variations in brightness that suggest some refraction and transparency properties consistent with crystalline material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ridge lines forming the dragon body show smooth, flowing transitions without abrupt angular bends or disproportionate thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body is characterized by smooth, flowing ridges that run the length of its form. These ridges are consistently spaced and do not display any abrupt angular bends, ensuring an organic appearance without noticeable thickness changes. This smooth transition contributes to a naturalistic representation in the edited image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rocky scales and moss-covered spines distributed in a way that mimics natural erosion and plant growth patterns without repeating textures or uniform spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the dragon's body covered in rocky scales and moss-covered spines. These features seem randomly distributed over its surface without a pattern of repetition or uniform spacing, mimicking the randomness typically seen in natural erosion and plant growth. The placement of moss and rocks follows a logical pattern seen in nature, further adding to the dragon's realistic texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dragon tail fade into the mist with a soft gradient, maintaining visibility of form through haze without sharp cutoffs or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tail of the dragon in Image B fades into the surrounding mist with a gradual transition. This gradient effect maintains visibility of the tail's form through the haze, without introducing any sharp cutoffs or segments that appear to float or detach visually. The effect is soft and consistent, contributing to the coherent integration of the dragon into its misty environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dragon features align with the sun's position in the sky and match the lighting on surrounding mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the dragon features, including shadows and highlights, is consistent with the sun's position visible in the sky. The shadows on the dragon align and match the lighting and shadows cast by the surrounding mountains, suggesting a coherent integration of the dragon into its lit environment. This consistency helps maintain a realistic appearance.",
