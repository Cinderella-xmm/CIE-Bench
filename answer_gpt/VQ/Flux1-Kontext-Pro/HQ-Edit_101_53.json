      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the wood grain on the pug's body appear continuous and natural, with no repeating patterns or unnatural stretching, especially along the spine and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug is portrayed as a wooden sculpture with a smooth texture consistent with carved wood. The wood grain appears to flow naturally over the pug’s body, with contours following the shape of the spine and limbs. There are no visible repeating patterns or unnatural stretching, which would suggest manipulation. The grain supports the form without interruption, giving an impression of careful craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and creases on the pug’s face rendered as smooth, shallow grooves consistent with carved wood, without sharp, broken, or overly deep lines that disrupt the natural form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pug’s face is carved from wood, and the wrinkles and creases are represented by smooth and shallow grooves. This is characteristic of careful wood carving. There are no sharp or broken lines that would disrupt the natural appearance of the sculpture. The facial lines are subtle and consistent with the medium of wood, maintaining the aesthetically pleasing form of the pug.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pug’s limbs, head, and torso retain their original proportions and anatomical alignment, with no visible elongation, compression, or misshapen joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the pug sculpture retains a symmetrical and proportionate form. The limbs, head, and torso are depicted in a realistic anatomical alignment, with no signs of elongation or compression. The joints appear naturally formed and the overall structure of the pug is consistent with a realistic representation of the animal, typical in wooden sculptures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the transitions between different parts of the wooden pug (e.g., head to neck, ear to head) seamless, with no visible cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden pug’s construction appears seamless, especially in the transitions from head to neck and ear to head. There are no visible cracks, ghosting, or color discontinuities, which suggests that the sculpture is a single piece or very well assembled. The attention to detail ensures a uniform appearance, maintaining the illusion of an expertly carved piece.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the black base beneath the pug flat, uniformly dark, and fully supporting the pug’s feet without any gaps, shadows suggesting suspension, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the pug seated on a black base that appears flat and uniformly dark. The pug's feet rest fully upon the base without any visible gaps or misalignment. The shadows and lighting suggest that the pug is well-supported, with no indication of suspension, which aligns with the presentation of a stable base for a sculpture.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the highlights and shadows on the wooden pug match the ambient lighting of the scene, with reflections and depth appropriate for polished wood rather than fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B casts highlights and shadows on the wooden pug consistent with polished wood's reflective qualities. The gradients of light and shadow enhance the three-dimensional form of the sculpture. The depth and reflections do not attempt to mimic fur; instead, they highlight the qualities of a wooden surface, appropriate for the material and consistent with the ambient lighting scenario depicted.",
