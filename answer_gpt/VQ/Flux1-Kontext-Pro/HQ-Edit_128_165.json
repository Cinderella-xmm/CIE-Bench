    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish have a consistent translucent appearance with no sharp edges, visible seams, or unnatural texture patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bell-shaped body of the jellyfish has a smooth, translucent appearance, resembling ornamental patterns that mimic the bioluminescent qualities of a jellyfish. It has seamless transitions without sharp edges or unnatural textures, reflecting the polished integration of ornate design with natural jellyfish characteristics. This appearance suggests a harmonious blend between artistic representation and realistic sea creature features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tendrils extending from the jellyfish's body smooth, curved, and iridescent, with no angular distortions or segmented appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tendrils emanating from the jellyfish's body are gracefully curved and possess an iridescent glow consistent with common characteristics of jellyfish. There are no angular distortions or visible segmentations in the tendrils, which present a fluid and organic movement, accurately embodying the natural flow expected in underwater environments.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the internal glowing patterns within the jellyfish's bell appear as natural, swirling bioluminescent designs without repeating geometric shapes or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows internal glowing designs that resemble bioluminescence. These swirling patterns lack repeated geometric shapes or jagged edges, attributing a natural and organic feel to the jellyfish-like structure. The illumination inside the jellyfish's bell enhances the realism of underwater bioluminescent life forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing nodules along the tendrils softly illuminated with gradual light spread and positioned in a natural, non-uniform but plausible arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals glowing nodules along the tendrils that produce a soft, gradual light spread, mimicking plausible bioluminescent phenomena seen in oceanic environments. These nodules are arranged in a non-uniform manner, which contributes to the natural realism of a jellyfish, highlighting a gentle and natural light emission.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the ambient lighting in the scene diffused and tinted with blue-green hues, and are there faint water particles or depth cues visible around the jellyfish, consistent with an underwater environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ambient lighting in Image B is distributed with diffused blue-green hues that resemble underwater scenes. There are visible cues of depth and faint particles that mimic those commonly found in aquatic settings, portraying a convincing underwater atmosphere suitable for the depicted jellyfish.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the connection point between the jellyfish and the ceiling smooth and continuous, with no floating segments or abrupt breaks in structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a jellyfish suspended in an underwater environment, with no reference to a ceiling or any connection point in the scene. Unlike Image A, which has a chandelier connecting to the ceiling, Image B solely focuses on an aquatic scenario, devoid of any structural ceiling connection. Therefore, the idea of a ceiling with connected segments is not applicable in this context.",
