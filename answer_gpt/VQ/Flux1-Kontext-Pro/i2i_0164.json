    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the area on the train where people were previously sitting look natural without any obvious artifacts or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis involved checking the space on top of the train where individuals originally sat. In Image B, it appears smooth and continuous without distinct artifacts or gaps, suggesting successful removal. The structural integrity remains intact, and the paint and details on the train do not show interruptions, which points to a natural-looking edit.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the conductor added atop the train well-integrated with the existing lighting and shadows, giving a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess the conductor's integration, I examined the lighting and shadow details. The conductor stands atop the train's engine with appropriate shadows aligning with the existing lighting direction and intensity. The position of shadows is consistent with other objects in the scene, suggesting good integration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the flag held by the conductor look natural, with proper proportions and a logical position relative to the train's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flag in Image B has sensible proportions and appears correctly anchored by the conductor. The flag's motion seems coherent with the dynamic of the train, supporting the engine's forward movement without looking out of place in terms of size or position.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any distortions or misalignments in the train's structure near the area where people were removed, and the conductor was added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection, Image B maintains alignment in the train's structural components. The train's paint, rivets, and other structural elements demonstrate continuity, suggesting no distortions or misalignments where edits were made, solidifying its natural look.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image remain balanced and stable after editing, with no noticeable shifts caused by the removal and addition of people?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the balance and stability of the composition in Image B, the removal of individuals and addition of the conductor created no irregularities. The train's proportions and orientations in relation to surrounding elements such as the station and crowd appear visually consistent with expectations, ensuring the composition retains stability.",
