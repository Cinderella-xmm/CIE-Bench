    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the table and chairs composed of uniformly sized brown and amber LEGO bricks with clean, interlocking edges and no visible breaks or misalignments in their surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the table and chairs appear to be made from uniformly sized LEGO bricks. The visual cues suggest clean, interlocking edges typical of LEGO construction, as expected from the precision of LEGO brick design. There are no visible breaks or misalignments in the surfaces, which aligns with the typically well-engineered nature of LEGO sets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the tabletop and chair seats display a consistent LEGO brick texture with repeating stud patterns and no unnatural stretching or distortion of individual bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tabletop and chair seats in Image B show a repetition of the LEGO brick texture, which is characterized by flat surfaces interspersed with small studs as expected. There is no indication of stretching or distortion of the individual bricks, maintaining a uniform pattern seen in LEGO constructions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central element on the table a LEGO-style plant made of green bricks with recognizable leaf shapes, and is it positioned centrally without overlapping or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central element appears to be a LEGO-style plant. The green bricks resemble recognizable leaf shapes typical of LEGO design, and the plant is positioned centrally on the tabletop without any overlapping edges or appearing to float above the surface, which suggests a stable placement consistent with LEGO construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the furniture placed on a flat, gray LEGO baseplate that fits snugly beneath the table and chairs, with no overhang beyond the furniture edges and no visible seam between the baseplate and the real ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The furniture in Image B rests on a flat, gray baseplate, similar to those used in LEGO setups. The baseplate fits snugly beneath the table and chairs with no overhang beyond furniture edges visible. The entire scene is consistent with a LEGO environment, suggesting that the baseplate is an integral part of the setup with no visible seam indicating a mismatch with the real ground.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or unnatural lighting shadows around the LEGO furniture that suggest incomplete rendering or poor integration with the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO furniture is rendered with smooth edges and clear definition, avoiding visual artifacts such as jagged edges or pixelation. The lighting and shadows around the furniture appear natural, with no signs of poor integration or incomplete rendering commonly associated with digital or graphic designs.",
