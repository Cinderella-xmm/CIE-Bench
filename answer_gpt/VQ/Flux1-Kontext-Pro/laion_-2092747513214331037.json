      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the metallic textures on the cyclist’s outfit and helmet reflect light consistently with the scene’s illumination and maintain accurate surface contours without warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cyclist’s outfit and helmet show a metallic texture that reflects the ambient light realistically based on the futuristic scene portrayed. The metallic surfaces appear to have accurate surface contours, with light reflecting smoothly without noticeable warping or inconsistency. The reflection aligns with the neon lighting environment and maintains the integrity of the metallic look throughout the outfit and helmet, indicating attention to detail in how light interacts with these surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the electric blue neon glow lines along the road edges and on the cyclist and car smooth, evenly lit, and free from jagged edges or overlapping with real-world details like tires or license plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The electric blue neon glow lines in Image B are depicted as smooth and evenly lit, enhancing the futuristic aesthetic. These lines are carefully integrated with the road edges, the cyclist, and the car, without any jaggedness or overlapping with critical real-world elements such as the cyclist's tires or a car's license plate. This demonstrates an effort to maintain visual coherence and avoid disrupting the image’s clarity with unintended overlaps or distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transparent visor data display on the cyclist’s helmet aligned with the helmet’s curvature, showing clear digital content without ghosting, blurring, or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent visor display on the cyclist’s helmet is seamlessly aligned with the helmet’s curvature, presenting digital content clearly. There is no visible ghosting, blurring, or distortion of the information displayed, which insinuates that the visor’s integration with the helmet was done with care to ensure readability and preservation of the helmet’s three-dimensional form. This clear presentation without issues showcases the effectiveness of the edit.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the holographic cycling stats near the escort car spatially coherent, appropriately sized relative to the car, and displayed with soft edges and ambient glow without casting incorrect shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic cycling stats shown near the escort car in Image B are well-aligned spatially and sensibly sized relative to the car, ensuring they’re noticeable but not overpowering. The stats are displayed with soft edges and a gentle ambient glow, adding to the futuristic theme without casting incorrect shadows that would break the immersion or spatial logic. The hologram floats appropriately in space, contributing to a coherent visual narrative without inconsistent visual cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements—including metallic finishes, neon glows, digital visor display, and holographic projections—coexist without visual contradictions such as mismatched lighting, texture clashes, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each edited element, from the metallic finishes on the cyclist’s gear to the neon glows and holographic projections, integrates consistently within the scene. Mismatched lighting or texture clashes that might disrupt the visual unity are absent, and no distorted shapes are evident. This cohesion suggests careful design and execution to maintain a harmonious futuristic theme where all elements complement rather than conflict with one another, creating a seamless narrative.",
