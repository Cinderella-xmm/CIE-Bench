    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the upper and lower tiers clearly defined with consistent perspective and proportional scaling, and is there a visible separation between them that suggests a layered structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe presents a miniaturized scene with a clear visual separation between tiers: the interior of the globe is distinct from the base. The perspective and proportional scaling are accurate as the lower tier (the base) holds the miniaturized Eiffel Tower scene which is layered upon it. The separation is visible due to the glass globe housing the scene. This reflects a common theme in snow globes where the environment within the glass is distinct from the supporting structure, suggesting a layered structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the buildings in the upper tier have a metallic sheen with subtle reflections and gradients that match the lighting direction, and are there no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Towers inside the snow globe have a realistic depiction with a golden metallic sheen. There are subtle reflections and gradients on the towers matching the apparent light source direction, giving them a realistic depth and texture. There are no flat or unnaturally uniform color patches on these structures, maintaining the illusion of a three-dimensional environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees and bushes in the lower tier composed of irregular, naturally shaped forms with varying heights and densities, and do they lack repeating texture tiles or unnatural symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees and bushes in the globe's base feature naturally irregular shapes with variation in height and density, suggesting a more organic layout. They lack obvious repeating patterns or symmetry that would indicate artificial tiling, maintaining the impression of a natural landscape.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the silvery flakes distributed across the space between tiers with soft edges, slight blurring, and depth-based opacity, indicating movement through air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe effect is achieved by silvery flakes distributed throughout the interior space of the globe. The flakes have soft edges and slight blurring, providing a sense of depth and movement, as expected of snow or similar particles suspended in air.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base show individually rendered cobblestones with visible grout lines and surface variations, and are the street lamps proportionally sized and evenly spaced along the path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe displays individually rendered cobblestones with detailed grout lines and surface texture variations, creating a realistic impression of a cobbled path. Additionally, the street lamps appear correctly proportioned and evenly spaced, enhancing the scene's authenticity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are both Eiffel Towers structurally intact with correct lattice patterns, uniform scaling, and no stretched or compressed sections that deviate from their known design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the snow globe, both Eiffel Towers maintain an accurate lattice pattern consistent with the known design. Their structure is intact without any apparent distortion such as stretching or compression. This uniform scaling throughout both miniature representations maintains the integrity of the iconic design.",
