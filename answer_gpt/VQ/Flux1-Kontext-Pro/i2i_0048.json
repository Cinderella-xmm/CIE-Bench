      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra sharp and distinct without any unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are visually clear with crisp edges, which indicates they are sharp and distinct without noticeable pixelation or blurring. The visual information such as the consistent pattern of black and white stripes supports this assessment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's fur textures appear natural without any visible artificial streaks or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's fur appears uniform and natural, maintaining a consistent texture that resembles the typical fur pattern of a zebra. There are no visible artificial streaks or unusual patterns disrupting this natural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the zebra's body consistent and free from any geometric distortions like warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body maintains natural proportions without any signs of warping or stretching. The shape and form of the zebra are consistent with a typical zebra, suggesting no geometric distortions are present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relative position between the zebra and the background grassland remain unchanged and natural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been dramatically changed from grassland (in Image A) to an urban setting, which affects the natural context and relative positioning of the zebra in the environment. This change results in the zebra not fitting naturally with the new background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the grass blades and the zebra's hooves detailed and free from any loss of sharpness or introduction of noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is no longer grassland but an urban surface, and the focus is on the zebra. The image does not provide information on grass blades, but the hooves appear sharp and clear, indicating no loss of sharpness or introduction of noise in this area.",
