    "explanation": "In Image B, the tie appears to be proportionally adjusted to fit within the collar and neck area without causing distortion to the shirt collar or suggesting an ill fit. When analyzing from Image A, the tie should already be in alignment and proportional, and in Image B, it retains this alignment, nestled under the collar without noticeably distorting the lines or shapes around it.",
