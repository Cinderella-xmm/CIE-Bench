      "question": "Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is opened into a pop-up form and seems to have consistent proportions with no warped edges or floating components. The spine and covers align well, maintaining a realistic structure. Common sense tells us that pop-up books should maintain structural integrity for them to be functional, and visually, there is no indication of distortion that would undermine this function.",

      "question": "Is the quill positioned centrally and vertically as a stable pivot, with natural feather texture and metallic base that match the original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quill appears to be positioned centrally and vertically, acting as a stable pivot. The feather texture looks natural, and the metallic base matches the materials seen in other components, like the lamp. This alignment and material consistency are typical for such displays to ensure visual harmony and realistic presentation.",

      "question": "Does the inkwellâ€™s transformation into a fountain include realistic water flow and surface reflections without unnatural highlights or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the inkwell turns into a small fountain. Upon inspecting the water flow and reflections, they appear to be realistic, with no unnatural highlights or broken geometry. The reflections on the water surface look coherent, contributing to a believable transformation. This effect fits well with expectations for realistic decorative miniatures.",

      "question": "Is the glass cloche transparent and free of distortion, with smooth curvature and accurate light refraction across all internal elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cloche over the scene exhibits transparency and has a smooth curvature. The light refraction and clarity over the internal elements appear accurate and not distorted, which is essential to maintaining the aesthetic display and functionality, similar to real glass cloches.",

      "question": "Are the engraved lines on the wooden base continuous, legible, and integrated with the wood texture without sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved lines on the wooden base appear continuous and legible. They integrate with the wood texture seamlessly and do not show sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations. Such precision is crucial for high-quality craftsmanship, ensuring the engraved elements look realistic and aesthetically pleasing.",
