      "question": "Are the brick textures and shapes of the building and the \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign consistent with Lego bricks, without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brick textures and shapes of the building exhibit characteristics consistent with Lego bricks. The rectangular brick pattern and the smooth lines are typical of Lego designs. The 'LAUNDROMAT' sign includes block lettering and a background that visually aligns with Lego's design aesthetics, presenting a coherent and consistent look akin to Lego bricks. Hence, there are no unnatural artifacts or loss of fine details introduced in this conversion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the person holding the laundry appear naturally integrated into the Lego-style environment without any visible distortion or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person holding the laundry has been transformed into a Lego-style figure. The body shape, clothing, and posture of the figure fit well with the typical characteristics of a Lego figure, notably the cylindrical limbs and blocky form. The transition between the person and the environment is seamless, without any visible distortion or unnatural blending, suggesting a natural integration into the Lego-style environment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the washing machines visible inside the laundromat maintain a structured look coherent with Lego bricks. The shapes are clear and the design is simple, aligning with the geometric and modular nature of Lego construction. There are no signs of broken geometry, indicating that the elements successfully simulate the appearance of being made from Lego bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stack of folded laundry is rendered as Lego bricks, reflected in the absence of natural fabric textures and the presence of smooth, solid-colored surfaces typical of Lego styles. The block-like representation with uniform colors indicates that it has indeed been transformed into a Lego-like appearance, rather than retaining natural fabric characteristics.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the scene, including the person, the laundry, and the laundromat, coherent and visually plausible as a stop-motion diorama crafted in the style of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene, including the Lego-style figure, the Lego representation of the laundromat building, and the converted laundry, forms a cohesive and visually plausible stop-motion diorama. Each element fits within the Lego aesthetic, maintaining a uniform style that is consistent with Lego constructions. The seamless integration of all components into this style evokes the distinctiveness of a crafted diorama.",
