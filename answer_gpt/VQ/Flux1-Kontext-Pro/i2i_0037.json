      "question": "Does the white border framing the image maintain a clean edge along the entire perimeter without disrupting the natural appearance of the dessert inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white border added around the image resembles the appearance of a Polaroid photo.

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light brown vintage filter applied to the image enhance its film-style appearance without causing any parts of the banana slices or whipped cream to appear unnaturally colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image has a slight vintage filter that gives it a retro, film-style look. This effect gives a warmer tone to the overall image but does not significantly alter the colors of the banana slices or the whipped cream, which remain natural and consistent with their usual appearance.",

      "question": "Is the handwritten caption \"Banana Cream Dream 2024\" at the bottom clear and legible with a natural look that complements the Polaroid-style photo without seeming out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The caption 'Banana Cream Dream 2024' is written in a style that mimics handwriting, adding to the authenticity and charm of the Polaroid-style effect. It is clear, legible, and fits well within the white border without appearing intrusive or out of sync with the photo's aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details like the texture of the whipped cream and the smooth surface of the cheesecake slice been preserved without showing any unnatural artifacts or blurring due to the editing effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the application of a filter and additional elements, the image retains the intricate details of the whipped cream, banana slices, and cheesecake. These elements maintain clarity and sharpness, indicating the editing hasn't introduced any distortion or blurring artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the newly added Polaroid frame and caption seamlessly integrate with the original image of the cheesecake and bananas, ensuring the dessert remains the focal point and no elements look disjointed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added frame and caption are designed to give the image a Polaroid aesthetic, which integrates well by framing the entire content. The dessert remains the central subject, with no part of the new frame or writing detracting or appearing disjointed. This cohesive presentation ensures the focal point remains on the cheesecake and bananas.",
