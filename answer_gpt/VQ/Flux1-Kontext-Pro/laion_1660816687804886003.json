      "question": "Does the navy blue mesh pattern on the can maintain consistent texture density and alignment without visible warping or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silver can features a navy blue mesh pattern that mimics the texture of a sneaker. The pattern appears to be well-aligned and maintains a uniform texture density across the visible portion of the can. There are no signs of warping or unnatural stretching typically seen in poorly edited images. Such seamless integration suggests careful rendering. Given these observations, the texture is consistent without visible issues.",

      "question": "Is the brand logo clearly visible on the front of the can, correctly proportioned, and free from blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a logo on the can that resembles a stylized 'C' with a navy, white, and red motif, similar to branding seen on athletic gear. The logo is clear, proportionate, and crisp with no noticeable blurring or distortion, indicative of high-quality editing. This clear depiction suggests it has been accurately placed and rendered.",

      "question": "Are the embossed lace textures evenly spaced and aligned around the can, without jagged edges or inconsistent depth that suggests digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the can displays navy blue lace textures around it. These textures are embossed and appear to be evenly spaced and aligned. There are no visible jagged edges or signs of inconsistent depth that would suggest digital artifacting. The uniformity and smoothness in their presentation imply a careful and precise editing process.",

      "question": "Do the sole stripes wrap seamlessly around the lower half of the can, maintaining their shape and spacing without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the can's design features diagonal stripes on the lower half, reminiscent of sneaker soles. These stripes are white against the navy blue background and follow a consistent angle and spacing. They appear to wrap seamlessly around the can, without any visible tearing, distortion, or misalignment, suggesting a smooth and precise application of the pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the red \"Kickstart\" text clearly readable, properly centered on the white area, and free from shadowing or blurring that would suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'Kickstart' in bold red font on a white background at the top of the can. The text is sharp, clear, and well-defined, without any shadowing or blurring, indicating high-quality rendering. It is also properly centered within the white area, maintaining a balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout. These factors suggest professional-quality text placement.",
