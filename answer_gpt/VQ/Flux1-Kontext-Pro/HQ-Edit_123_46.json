      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines precisely trace the edges of the player, basketball, hoop, and court without overlapping or cutting into the underlying forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines are generally designed to follow the edges of the comic-style illustration elements. By observing visually, we notice that each part—the player, basketball, hoop, and court—maintains a distinct sculpted appearance, which implies properly traced outlines typical in comic illustrations. The process involves using thicker lines around the subjects to enhance the stylistic appeal without encroaching on the forms themselves.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dynamic action lines positioned along the direction of motion and do they avoid intersecting solid objects like the player’s body or the basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, dynamic action lines radiate outward from the basketball hoop in vibrant colors. They do not cross any solid object such as the player or the basketball. The positioning gives a sense of speed and action, highlighting the movement direction away from the hoop. This is a common technique used to enhance movement and energy in comic illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red and orange hues applied consistently across the image without causing visible color bleeding, banding, or loss of detail in areas such as the jersey fabric, skin tone, or wooden floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the coloring style is consistently executed in a comic manner. The red and orange hues build depth and vibrancy without showing any color bleeding or banding, which is typically evident through blurred or indistinct transitions between colors. Key details like the jersey fabric's texture and skin tones maintain their specific characteristics amidst the vivid colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the text overlay clearly legible, positioned outside the main subject area, and not covering any essential part of the player or basketball?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text overlay reading 'STUAH' is placed at the bottom right of the frame, positioned outside the main action zone. This respects the visual integrity of essential elements such as the player or basketball, ensuring clarity when conveying the comic panel's message.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the comic panel border evenly drawn around the entire image, maintaining consistent thickness and not cropping any part of the player, hoop, or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a comic panel with a consistent, thick border surrounding the imagery. The frame appears even, and no essential parts—like the player or basketball hoop—are cropped. This uniform framing is typical in comics to enhance focus on the primary subjects within the panel.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers, correctly proportioned and naturally curved around the ball, with no extra digits or unnatural gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B correctly illustrates the hand with five fingers, proportioned and positioned naturally around the basketball, as typically depicted in stylized comic versions. This avoids any extra digits or unnatural arrangements, maintaining anatomical correctness despite the artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the basketball fully spherical with visible seam lines and no flattened or distorted regions despite the comic-style rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the comic-styled aesthetics, the basketball retains a spherical form with discernible seam lines and no apparent distortion. This visual checking aligns with the standard depiction where spheres, including sports equipment like basketballs, maintain their shape integrity.",
