      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dog's body maintain a natural and structurally consistent pose in the chibi-style, without any noticeable distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's body retains a compact and proportionate appearance typical of chibi-style art, which often involves exaggerating certain features such as the head while keeping the body smaller. The dog's pose appears natural and consistent with this art style, lacking any signs of awkward deformation or unrealistic alignment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the enlarged head been integrated naturally into the image, without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's head is noticeably larger in relation to its body, which aligns with the chibi art style that emphasizes cuteness through exaggerated features. The integration appears smooth, with no visible artifacts or textural inconsistencies that would suggest poor editing or unnatural appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tennis ball touching the dog's nose in a way that looks natural and physically plausible, without any awkward positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis ball is positioned right in front of the dog's nose, creating a convincing and plausible interaction. The placement suggests that the dog is about to play with the ball, adhering to natural behavior and maintaining physical plausibility without any awkward angles or unnatural gaps.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the relief tennis ball pattern on the base match well with the rest of the scene, contributing to a cohesive and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relief tennis ball pattern on the base complements the main tennis ball in the scene, creating a thematic coherence that enhances the whimsical and playful setting. The patterned base does not clash with the overall image, instead contributing to a coordinated and visually appealing composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Has the edited image retained the original focus on the ball while successfully integrating the chibi-style elements, resulting in a balanced and visually coherent composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style features, such as the large head and diminutive body, are integrated seamlessly, while the primary focus remains on the interaction between the dog and the tennis ball. The composition remains balanced as the exaggerated features of the dog, the central tennis ball, and the patterned base all complement each other, creating an inviting and coherent visual narrative.",
