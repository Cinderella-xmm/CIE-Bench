      "question": "Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is viewed from the front. It displays a consistent structure with pillows neatly arranged on its surface. The overall shape is rectangular with a slightly rounded edge on the cushions, which is typical of modern sofas. The visual cues show that the sofa's lines and angles are in proportion, and nothing appears distorted in a way that would suggest geometric inconsistency. Upon examining Image A from the side, the sofa maintains a consistent shape with parallel lines and appropriate angles that match the frontal view, suggesting no distortions occurred. Given this analysis, the sofa's structural integrity remains intact in both views.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric texture of the sofa appears to be uniform and clear. The fabric seems smooth with no signs of distortion or pixelation. This is consistent with a high-quality sofa fabric. Upon checking Image A, the side view displays a similarly smooth and natural-looking texture without any inconsistencies. The details in the fabric texture, such as the stitching or fabric grain are consistent between both angles, reinforcing the quality and homogeneity of the material.",

      "question": "Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals cushion alignment on the sofa that is typical and natural for a front view, with the cushions uniformly placed. The legs are visible beneath the sofa and appear to support it evenly. Analyzing Image A, where the sofa is viewed from the side, the cushions appear to maintain their placement and alignment with the frame. The legs still provide appropriate support in relation to the sofaâ€™s position, corresponding well with their appearance in the front view.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, lighting from the windows casts shadows naturally on the sofa and the floor. The play of light highlights one side of the sofa while leaving soft shadows on the other, indicating believable light behavior. In Image A, despite the altered viewpoint, shadows and light act consistently with a slight variation due to the angle change, which would be expected. The light seems to originate from the same source and maintains similar intensity and directionality.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork in Image B is a circular, abstract painting with prominent warm colors at the center, fading to cooler tones. It hangs flush against the wall, ensuring no warping or distortion due to perspective issues. Analyzing Image A from a side perspective, the painting remains consistently flat and visually realistic, retaining its color vibrancy and accurate portrayal despite the angle change. This suggests that the wall and artwork maintain their natural and true appearances across both views.",
