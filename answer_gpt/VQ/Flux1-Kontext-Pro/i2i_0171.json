      "question": "Do the skis appear naturally detached from the skier with no visible artifacts or unnatural distortions in their shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis appear to be detached from the skier but are included as separate components in the toy packaging, which mimics an action figure setup. The packaging seems to be designed to showcase each part individually, which is common for figurines. There are no visible artifacts or distortions in the shape of the skis themselves in this setup context, aligning with the typical design of toy figurines where parts are sometimes separate.",

      "question": "Does the magnetic snow powder base integrate seamlessly into the snowy landscape without introducing unnatural textures or breaking the scene's structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the magnetic snow powder base is depicted as part of a toy set, meant for display within the packaging. Although it doesn't literally integrate into the landscape, in the context of a toy setup, it shows no significant discrepancies in texture or color that would break the visual consistency within the packaging. It appears as a cohesive element designed to simulate a snowy environment for the figurines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skier's facial features and body proportions accurately preserved in the figurine form, avoiding any distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier is represented as a figurine within toy packaging. The body proportions of the figurines are consistent with what one would expect for such representations, which often prioritize robust and simplified details for durability and aesthetic appeal. The form appears proportionate, matching the style that is typically seen in action figures. There are no evident distortions in the representation of the body structure.",

      "question": "Do the packaging illustrations match the visual style and natural appearance of the skier and mountain environment without introducing any unnatural elements or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases packaging that draws from the visuals of a toy figure set against a background that appears to be based on the original skiing environment. The illustrations on the packaging maintain a stylistic coherence with the natural appearance of skiing scenes. There are no obvious unnatural elements or artifacts in this context, as the figures and the background design are harmoniously integrated to create a visually collective product.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the skier's hands, ski poles, and posture anatomically correct and visually credible compared to the original image, with no unnatural shapes or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier's figure, even though a toy, represents the posture and general anatomical positioning seen in Image A. The hands, ski poles, and overall stance maintain an anatomically correct form within the toy's aesthetic constraints. The posture seems credible, reflecting a skiing position similar to that in Image A but translated into the stylistic norms of action figurines, with no apparent distortions.",
