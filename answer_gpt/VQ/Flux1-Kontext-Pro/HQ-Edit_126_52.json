      "question": "Are the crystal shards aligned with the cactus ribs and uniformly distributed without gaps or overlapping clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is adorned with crystal shards that appear aligned along the ribs of the cactus. The distribution of these shards appears symmetrical, and there are no visible gaps or overlapping clusters among them. Each shard is distinct and separated, creating a uniform decoration across the surface.",

      "question": "Do the luminous glyphs follow the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow without causing overexposure or halo effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features luminous glyphs embedded in the cactus. These glyphs are positioned along the rib lines of the cactus and emit a soft glow that enhances the visual appeal without overexposure or creating halo effects around their locations. The light emitted appears well-integrated and controlled.",

      "question": "Is the sandstone pedestal fully grounded on the wooden surface with natural texture and no floating or clipped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal appears to be resting on sandy ground rather than a wooden surface. The base is depicted with textures that blend naturally into the environment without any visible floating or clipped edges, maintaining a grounded appearance.",

      "question": "Are the amber eyes embedded within the cactus ribs at symmetrical positions and do they show internal illumination without distorting the surrounding tissue?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cactus in Image B shows amber eyes embedded symmetrically along the ribs. These eyes have an internal illumination that enhances their visibility and adds to the overall aesthetic without distorting the surrounding cactus tissue, maintaining the integrity of the cactus structure.",

      "question": "Do the vine tendrils curve naturally around the pedestal and connect smoothly to the base without floating or rigid positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts vine tendrils that curve naturally around the pedestal, giving an organic feel to their positioning. The vines appear to connect smoothly to the base and drape in a way that suggests natural growth, without any visible floating or excessive rigidity.",
