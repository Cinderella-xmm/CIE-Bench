      "question": "Does the perfume bottle appear to be constructed from Lego bricks without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle itself retains its traditional, elegant glass appearance and is not constructed from Lego bricks. The main modification involving Lego bricks is the spray, which is represented by a formation of grey Lego blocks meant to mimic the diffused spray. This alteration results in an unnaturally rigid and blocky appearance for the spray, which contrasts with the smooth texture of the actual perfume bottle. This indicates that the Lego representation is separate from the bottle and does not pertain to the bottle's texture or construction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the fabric background transformed into Lego bricks maintain a natural appearance without any obvious distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the fabric background beneath the perfume bottle has not been transformed into Lego bricks. It retains the appearance of a smooth, flowing fabric with natural folds and texture. The inclusion of Lego bricks is limited to the spray area, not affecting the fabric. Consequently, there are no distortions or unnatural shapes on the fabric surface caused by a transformation into Lego bricks.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the perfume bottle and the fabric background preserved, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the proportions and physical structure of the perfume bottle and the fabric background are maintained in their natural, recognizable forms. The bottle remains elegantly-shaped with a faceted appearance, and the fabric displays realistic folds and drapery without any geometric distortion. The only geometric alteration is the incorporation of Lego blocks in the spray, which is distinct from the bottle and fabric, ensuring the latter two retain their intended proportions and realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, with the perfume bottle and fabric background made of Lego bricks, retain visual credibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a contrast between the perfume bottle and fabric, which remain in their authentic forms, and the clearly Lego-constructed spray. This combination introduces a playful, imaginative element, but the coherence of the image is compromised due to the juxtaposition of the naturally-textured bottle and fabric with the blocky, artificial Lego spray. As such, while the bottle and fabric maintain their credibility, the Lego element disrupts the overall visual coherence when considering a realistic setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the perfume bottle and the fabric background accurately represented in the Lego brick form without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, neither the perfume bottle nor the fabric background are represented in Lego brick form; only the spray is. The fine details and textures of both the bottle and the fabric remain intact and accurately rendered in their traditional forms, showing no replication into Lego. Thus, there is no question of a loss of detail in translating these elements into Lego, as they retain their realistic depictions.",
