    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features and tiny hands added to each cereal bar proportionally sized and positioned in a way that maintains the original rectangular shape of the bars without distorting their geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When examining Image B, it is clear that no facial features or hands are added to the cereal bars; they retain their original rectangular shape without modifications that alter their geometry. This indicates that the geometrical integrity of the bars is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cereal bar characters appear to interact with the pink flamingo mug in a physically plausible manner, such as touching or leaning toward it, without violating spatial logic or causing visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B doesn't display any characters or additions on the cereal bars that would interact with the pink flamingo mug. The cereal bars are simply placed near the mug and the cereal box, maintaining consistent spatial logic without any interaction-related inconsistencies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the whimsical font placed above the cereal bar characters clearly legible, properly aligned, and free from artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's a whimsical font at the top with the text: 'Charming Cereal Creations.' The text appears clearly legible and properly aligned without artifacts such as jagged edges or blurring, indicating a well-executed addition to the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the added facial features and hands on the cereal bars preserve the original texture of the chocolate and cereal layers, without introducing unnatural smoothness, sharp edges, or missing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no facial features or hands added to the cereal bars in Image B. The texture of the chocolate and cereal layers remains unchanged, displaying their original detail, which means the original texture is preserved.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tiny hands added to the cereal bars have a natural number of fingers (no more than five), proper curvature, and appropriate shadowing to match the lighting in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In reviewing Image B, tiny hands have not been added to the cereal bars. Therefore, considerations of finger count, curvature, and shadowing are irrelevant as no such elements are present.",
