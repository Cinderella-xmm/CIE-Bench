      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a tall, rectangular silhouette with smooth, continuous vertical sides and no visible warping or collapsed edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object clearly retains a tall, rectangular shape, similar to a bottle or other taller container, with smoothly aligned sides that show no signs of distortion or collapse. This shape is consistent with objects that emphasize height and consistent vertical lines. Thus, based on visual evidence that highlights the intact and vertical edges of the container in Image B, we conclude the silhouette is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the retractable handle replaced by a metallic spray nozzle that appears seamlessly attached to the top of the vessel, with no visible seams or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, we see a metallic spray nozzle on top, indicating a change from the original handle. The nozzle appears to be integrated smoothly without visible seams or signs of an uneven join. Normally, spray nozzles on bottles are designed to be compact and integral to the container design. These qualities suggest a seamless fit and transition from the suitcase handle originally in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the fabric panels replaced with translucent purple-tinted glass that shows uniform translucency and clearly defined embossed linear patterns matching the original seam locations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object is composed of translucent purple-tinted glass, replacing the fabric from Image A with consistent translucency. The embossed linear patterns are visible, simulating original seam-like features that indicate clear definition and uniformity across the surface. Such designs typically entail uniform translucency for aesthetic appeal and pattern elegance, hence confirming the change to glass with visible embossed lines.",

      "question": "Is the logo positioned near the top center of the front face and rendered as a clean, subtle etching on the glass surface without any visible digital artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo in Image B is indeed placed near the top center of the glass surface and appears to be a precisely etched feature, normally seen in designing elegant bottles. Such etchings are made to appear sharp and clear without artifacts for visibility and branding distinctiveness. The absence of blurring or distortion further supports the careful rendering of the logo.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the four wheels replaced with identical decorative caps at each corner of the base, appearing as solid, polished elements without exposed mechanical parts or asymmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the base features what appears to be wheels similar to decorative caps in appearance. They seem identical and polished, with no visible mechanical components or asymmetrical design, which aligns with decorative elements commonly added for aesthetic purposes in product design. This observation supports the replacement of typical wheels with a decorative presentation.",
