      "question": "Does the bag character retain its original earthy tones, leather straps, and structural design without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag character retains the same earthy tones as in Image A, as well as the leather straps, maintaining the original structural design. The textures remain consistent, and there are no unnatural additions or missing fine details that would disrupt the authenticity of the bag's elements. The artistic rendition did not overshadow the natural textures and design of the bag.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the bowl character been transformed in a way that maintains its original proportions and avoids any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bowl character appears in Panel 3, and its proportions seem consistent with those in Image A. The round shape and overall size remain unchanged, and there are no noticeable geometric distortions. The conversion into a cartoon style maintains the integrity of the bowl's original proportions despite the stylistic shift.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the expressions and actions of the bag and bowl characters in both panels feel natural and consistent with the described scenarios without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bag character is given a voice and expressions akin to a sentient being, typical in comic strip adaptations. The dialogue emphasizes the bag's personality, integrating naturally into the scene. Similarly, the bowl remains static in Panel 3, maintaining an appropriate position next to the bag. The expressions and actions do not introduce any visual artifacts that are inconsistent with a comic-style narrative, thereby appearing natural within this context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the cat-like attributes added to the bag character integrated seamlessly with the original design without disrupting the overall structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, particularly in Panel 2, the cat-like attributes, such as the ears, are visible on the round-headed character at the bottom. While these features have been added, they do not appear on the bag character itself, which maintains its original design throughout the panels. Therefore, if we consider separately, the added attributes do not disrupt the bag's integrity since they are part of another character.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the positioning and movement of the bowl character in Panel 2 physically logical and maintains the integrity of the scene without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the bowl character is positioned consistently with the layout seen in Image A, maintaining the same space on the floor. The bowl's placement in the subsequent panel appears stable and physically logical with respect to its previous position and narrative continuity. There are no unusual or unexplained movements that disrupt the scene's logical integrity.",
