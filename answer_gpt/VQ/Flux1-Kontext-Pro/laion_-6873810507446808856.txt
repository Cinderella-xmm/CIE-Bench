    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes added to the pancake surfaces positioned symmetrically and proportionally consistent with the size and shape of the pancakes, without deforming the surrounding texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pancake on the left features eyes that are cartoonish and centered around the top of the pancake. These eyes are not part of Image A. The placement of the eyes in Image B maintains the pancake's roundness and symmetry, and the texture around the eyes isn't distorted; the eyes look natural as part of the pancake's surface. The cartoonish style matches the concept of a comic strip.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the butter pat still recognizable as a solid block with clean edges and natural lighting, even after being stylized as a hat, without exhibiting warped or fragmented geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butter pat transforms into a hat, which is a common stylistic choice in animations to add character. Despite this stylization, the hat maintains its rectangular block-like structure and appears to rest naturally on the pancake, matching its edges and lighting with the comical theme. The geometry isn't warped, aligning with the cartoon-like portrayal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the syrup stream extend downward from the pancake stack in a continuous, smooth arc without abrupt breaks, pixelation, or unnatural viscosity that contradicts liquid behavior?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a syrup stream that flows into a winding path, which is fluid and smooth, consistent with the depiction of such syrup in cartoons. There aren't any abrupt breaks or pixelations. The flow mirrors syrup's natural behavior, albeit exaggerated for cartoon effect, maintaining a liquid-like appearance throughout its exaggerated path.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the added breakfast items (e.g., coffee cups, scrambled eggs) aligned with the depth and lighting of the original scene, maintaining consistent shadows and scale relative to the pancake stack?",
    "explanation": "Image B introduces additional elements like a coffee cup alongside the pancake. These items are placed correctly in terms of depth and scale within the scene's perspective, showing appropriate shadows and lighting that align with the scene's overall style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the speech bubbles and text boxes positioned in open areas of the frame without overlapping critical elements such as the pancake stack or syrup stream, and do they have clear, legible letterforms without jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles and text boxes are carefully positioned around the pancake stack, not obstructing critical scene elements like the syrup. The text inside them is clear, with smooth letter edges that maintain readability, fitting in with the comic's style without disrupting the visual flow.",
    "answer": "Yes"
