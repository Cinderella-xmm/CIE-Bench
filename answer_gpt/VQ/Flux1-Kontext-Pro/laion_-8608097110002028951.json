      "question": "Does the facade of the theater building appear composed of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents, without visible seams, irregular patterns, or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the theater building facade is shown with a smoother, consistent appearance. The colors are simplified to a tan with brown accents, typical of LEGO bricks. LEGO constructions usually exhibit uniformity in color and texture, and this is represented in the image without visible seams or irregular patterns, as would occur if the bricks were assembled correctly. Therefore, it suggests that the facade is made of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the three large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes that preserve the arch shape but feature a regular grid pattern, without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the arched windows filled with LEGO-style panes. These panes are square, forming a grid pattern that fits the arches without visible distortion or misalignment. LEGO builds tend to simplify complex shapes into geometric patterns while maintaining the overall structure. Therefore, the windows in Image B fit this description of LEGO-style panes.",

      "question": "Do the \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" signs show letters constructed from smooth red flat LEGO bricks, maintaining legibility and alignment with the awning structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' signs appear smooth and are part of the awning structure, resembling LEGO-style construction. The letters maintain their legibility and are well aligned with the awnings. LEGO bricks can be used to create flat, smooth surfaces when used in constructions such as signage, which is consistent with what is observed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles with simplified shapes, including rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces, without retaining realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cars have a blocky rendition characteristic of LEGO vehicles. They are simplified to have rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces. Features like curved fenders or chrome trim, common in realistic cars, are not present. This transformation is consistent with how LEGO models approximate complex shapes with simpler forms.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the LEGO-style cars and building maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment, with no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scale of LEGO-style cars and buildings appears consistent, maintaining alignment with each other and their environment appropriately. There are no signs of floating parts or misalignment within the structure or vehicles. LEGO constructions are usually designed to ensure cohesiveness and scale across different elements. The image captures this aspect accurately.",
