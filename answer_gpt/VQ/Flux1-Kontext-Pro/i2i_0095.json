      "question": "Does the word 'Shine' appear seamlessly integrated into the mirror with no visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, the word 'Shine' is neatly placed within the mirror, with smooth and even outlines. There are no visible pixels, jagged edges, or other common artifacts that suggest a poor editing job. The integration into the mirror's surface appears natural, indicating a high-quality editing effort that aligns with common editing standards where artifacts are best avoided.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and glow effect of the word 'Shine' consistent with the aesthetic of the bathroom and does not look out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glow effect surrounding the word 'Shine' matches the soft and subtle lighting style found throughout the bathroom. The modern, minimalist aesthetic of the bathroom is complemented by the elegant script of the word 'Shine' and its gentle glow, creating a harmonious look. This consistency suggests that the word 'Shine' is purposefully designed to fit the environment, providing a unified visual effect that doesn't disrupt the bathroom's style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the addition of the word 'Shine' maintain the mirror's original shape and proportions, avoiding any geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the addition of 'Shine' does not affect the geometry of the mirror. The rectangular shape and proportions remain unchanged, as the word is incorporated into the mirror, rather than altering its physical boundaries. This precision suggests careful editing that respects the original form of the mirror while enhancing it with additional elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the reflective properties of the mirror undisturbed by the addition of 'Shine', preserving the clarity and detail of the mirrorâ€™s surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the presence of the word 'Shine', the mirror's surface remains clear and intact, with no signs of blurring or obstruction in its reflective properties. The word is added as an overlay and does not interfere with the mirror's primary function. This indicates that the visual properties of the mirror are expertly preserved during the editing process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning, size, and lighting of the word 'Shine' seem authentic, enhancing rather than detracting from the visual credibility of the bathroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Shine' in Image B is positioned centrally and prominently on the mirror. Its size is proportional to the mirror's area, ensuring it is noticeable but not overwhelming. The lighting effect gives it a realistic appearance that complements the ambient lighting, enhancing the bathroom's visual appeal rather than conflicting with it. This realistic portrayal reflects skilled editing, aligning with a plausible and aesthetically pleasing scenario.",
