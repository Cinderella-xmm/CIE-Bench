    "Question": "Q1: Are the gemstone inlays embedded into the crown surface without visible gaps or floating elements, and does the crown retain the original curvature of the marble top?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crown appears to be adorned with gemstones which are seamlessly embedded, giving no impression of gaps or floating elements. However, the original curvature of the marble top from Image A is transformed into a more angular crown shape in Image B. The curvature does not seem to have been retained. Thus, the inlays are embedded well, but the crown's shape differs significantly from the marble top.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the robe follow the original cabinet’s curved sides and tapering shape, and do the fabric folds and patterns flow naturally without sharp breaks or artificial lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe transforms the curvature of the cabinet sides into a more angular armor shape with distinct edges, which contrasts with the gentle taper seen in Image A. The patterns and lines depict armor plates rather than flowing fabric, presenting sharp rather than natural lines, suggesting a lack of natural flow.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the drawer engravings positioned at the waistline as belt buckles, aligned with the robe’s structure, and connected with visible straps or fastenings that appear physically plausible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the drawer engravings are used creatively for the armor design, with one positioned at the chest area and two below resembling layered armor, but not specifically as belt buckles. They don't connect with visible straps or fastenings that appear physically plausible, focusing more on aesthetics than practical function.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the clawed feet maintain the original leg length and thickness, and are the claws proportionally sized and fully touching the ground without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clawed feet are robust and consistent in length and positioned on the ground, integrating smoothly into the figure, maintaining proportional sizing. This matches the overall design and provides an appearance of solidity and alignment similar to how the cabinet legs appear stable in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the drawer openings transformed into pouches with visible flap closures and stitching, and do they hang from the robe with realistic weight and attachment points?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the drawer openings remain as part of the armor structure, not as pouches. There are no visible flap closures or stitching, and they do not mimic hanging or attachment in a realistic manner, instead serving as integral pieces of the armor design that don't convey portable or flexible attributes.",
    "answer": "No"
