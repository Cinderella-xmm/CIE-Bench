    "Question": "Q1: Does the male's shirt display a consistent 3D plush texture with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural shading that breaks the illusion of depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt's texture appears smooth and plush, consistent with a 3D rendering. There are no visible pixelation or jagged edges. The shading is natural and evenly distributed, supporting the illusion of depth in a typical plush fabric, which suggests that the rendering quality is high.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the collar of the male's shirt proportionally enlarged without distorting the neck or shoulder line, and does it maintain smooth contours without sharp or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the collar appears proportionate to the overall design without distortion of the neck or shoulder line. The contours are smooth, and there are no sharp or broken edges. This suggests attention to proportional design and smooth rendering in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the pleats on the female's pants symmetrically arranged and physically plausible, without floating or overlapping layers that defy gravity or fabric tension?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pleats on the female's pants appear to be symmetrically arranged. They follow a cohesive pattern and are positioned realistically according to fabric tension and gravity. The arrangement reflects natural fabric flow and proper rendering, suggesting physically plausible pleating.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the enlarged sleeve on the femaleâ€™s top extend naturally from the shoulder without distorting her arm or causing unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sleeve appears to extend naturally from the shoulder. The arm is not distorted, and no unnatural gaps or overlaps near the elbow and hand are visible. The rendering reflects realistic clothing flow, maintaining proportionality and continuity in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the pastel-colored stage beneath the characters evenly lit and proportionally scaled, with no abrupt color shifts or shadow inconsistencies that suggest poor integration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel-colored stage is evenly lit and proportionally scaled, matching the characters' scale. The lighting is consistent without abrupt color shifts, and shadow placement appears natural, indicating the stage is well-integrated into the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
