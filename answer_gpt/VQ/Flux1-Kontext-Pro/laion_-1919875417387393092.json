      "question": "Is the glass cloche added over the pottery setup transparent, smoothly shaped, and free of visible artifacts such as jagged edges or distorted reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cloche in Image B appears smooth, transparent, and has a seamless dome shape. There are no visible jagged edges, distortion, or reflections that disrupt its transparency. The clarity of the objects inside, such as the pottery and the miniature figures, suggests a properly rendered glass surface.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clay pieces exhibit a uniform, realistic patina that blends naturally with their original gray tone without abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clay pieces on the table have acquired a blue and rust-colored patina. The transition from the original gray tone to the new colors appears smooth, enhancing realism by suggesting aged or oxidized surfaces typical in handcrafted pottery. There are no harsh or abrupt color shifts, indicating a natural blending process.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the miniature fairies proportionally scaled to the pottery and tools, positioned realistically on or near the table, and anatomically accurate with intact limbs and natural poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A miniature figure is present at the base of the pottery setup in Image B. It is proportionally smaller than the pottery and positioned next to a wooden plaque. The figure seems anatomically correct, with intact limbs and a pose suggesting interaction with the setup, maintaining proportionate scale and realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the moss and tiny flowers placed along the edges of the wooden table with natural growth patterns and realistic textures, without covering critical structural components or appearing artificially pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss and tiny flowers are placed around the base of the setup rather than directly on the table's edges. Their distribution appears natural, similar to how such flora would grow around a structure. The textures are realistic, and they do not obstruct or cover essential components of the structure, enhancing the diorama's lifelike quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden plaque attached securely to the base, correctly sized relative to the structure, and does it display clear, readable engravings without warping or unnatural surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden plaque in Image B is attached to the base, proportionally sized to complement the diorama's scale. The engraving on the plaque is clear and readable, ensuring no warping or unrealistic texture, which maintains the aesthetic and functional purposes expected of such a diorama.",
