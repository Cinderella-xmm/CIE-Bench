    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, including the eyes, are considered when assessing alignment with their structures. Enlarged eyes usually lead to unnatural spacing or distortion. Observing Image B, there is no visible distortion or unnatural spacing, suggesting that if they were enlarged, it was done subtly enough not to disturb alignment. Using common knowledge about face proportions helps determine if the eyes fit naturally. Since there's no visible issue, it is reasonable to conclude that the adjustments align well with the facial structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the hands of the woman and child show five fingers each, with natural finger curvature and no overlapping or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the hands of both the woman and the child with clear visual cues of having five fingers each. Common knowledge of human anatomy dictates that normal hands should display all five fingers, naturally curved when at rest or in action. In Image B, the fingers do not appear to overlap unnaturally or be missing. Their presentation suggests natural curvature and alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, assessing texture and color transitions requires attention to detail, especially looking for signs of editing like sharp digital edges or blotches. The dresses and flowers maintain a natural, smooth flow of colors, indicating high-quality processing. Such smoothness usually points to meticulous editing consistent with real-life fabric and floral appearances.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
    "explanation": "Assessing Image B involves comparing the floral accents with the original state (Image A), noting factors like consistency in size and texture. The flowers appear homogeneous across the scene regarding size and integration with light. Shadows are consistent with the lighting origin, suggesting that added flowers, if any, have been seamlessly integrated with existing elements, creating a natural composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the wooden border have uniform thickness, natural wood grain, and proper alignment with the image edges without gaps or warping?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays a wooden frame, necessitating careful observation of thickness, wood grain, and edge alignment. A uniform design indicates good craftsmanship or editing. Assessment includes checking for natural wood grain and evaluating the edges for alignment against warping or gaps. Visual inspection shows that all these elements are orderly and skillfully presented, suggesting a high-quality frame.",
    "answer": "Yes"
