      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowy mountain setting suggests a bright environment with diffuse lighting due to the reflective nature of snow. The dog and the blue mat in Image B exhibit appropriate shadows and highlights, aligning well with the ambient lighting conditions typically found in snowy settings. The lighting consistency on the dog and mat matches the outdoor environment's characteristics, helping maintain a realistic appearance.",
