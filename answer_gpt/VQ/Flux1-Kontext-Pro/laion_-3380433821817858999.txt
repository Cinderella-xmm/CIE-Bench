    "Question": "Q1: Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?",
    "explanation": "The added kneeling figure is shown in the first and second panels of image B with their hands visible, and based on common character design, it is expected to have five fingers on each hand. Upon closer inspection, the hand shapes appear natural, with no distortions or awkwardly bent joints that would suggest anatomical incorrectness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
    "explanation": "In panel 2 of image B, the character is depicted in a leaping position with limbs extended. The visual representation of dynamic movement is indicated by the posture and positioning of the legs and torso. The alignment of the limbs shows continuity without any obvious breaks or warping that would suggest an unnatural stance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
    "explanation": "In the images within the edited comic panels, the character's knees are indeed shown tucked close to the chest. The posture suggests a moment captured mid-leap, where the tight tucking of knees is important for the action pose. The musculature and curvature appear regular and don't display distortion, supporting an interpretation of anatomically correct rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "The illustrations in the panels of image B show figures defined by bold outlines that delineate the boundaries of different color sections. These outlines are continuous and smooth, adhering to the shape of the character without evident breaks or leaps into adjacent colors.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
    "explanation": "In image B, the positioning of text and labels is done with care not to interfere with the key visual elements of the character. The central aspects like limbs and facial area are free from obstruction, allowing for full visibility of expression and movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
    "explanation": "The analysis of the panels in Image B shows that the character representation across different steps maintains uniformity in scaling and perspective. Despite the action variations depicted, the size of the figures remains compatible with the central character's dimensions, suggesting a conscientious effort to ensure scale consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
