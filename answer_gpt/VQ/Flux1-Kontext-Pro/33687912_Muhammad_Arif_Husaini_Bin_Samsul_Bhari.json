    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shell-like body of the creature have consistent curvature and smooth surface transitions without visible cracks, misaligned segments, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell-like body of the creature appears to have a consistent curvature, showcasing a smooth surface transition. This suggests a seamless and unified form without any visible cracks or misalignment, indicative of a design intended to mimic natural shell structures. By observing the curves and continuity of the shell, it aligns with the characteristics of an uninterrupted shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the coral-like spires distributed organically along the back of the creature, with varying heights and irregular shapes that resemble natural coral formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spires on the back of the creature resemble coral formations, featuring variability in height and irregular shapes. These traits imitate natural coral distribution, which is typically uneven and non-uniform, adding to the organic appearance of the creature's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing sea guardian spirits emit soft, diffused light that originates from their bodies and does not produce sharp halos or isolated bright spots outside their forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing figures (sea guardian spirits) appear to emit a soft light that is diffused evenly from their bodies. The glow is consistent and does not create sharp halos or isolated bright spots, which gives an impression of gentle illumination consistent with an ethereal or mystical theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminescent wave pattern behind the creature flow smoothly in the same direction as the original wake, with colors transitioning gradually from warm orange to deep red matching the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent wave pattern indeed flows in the same direction as the original wake seen in Image A, indicating continuity in motion. The color transition from warm orange to deep red aligns with the sunset tones in the sky, contributing to a harmonious scene where the wave colors reflect the celestial palette.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the creature cast a faint shadow on the water surface beneath it, and are its illuminated parts consistent with the direction of sunlight from the setting sun?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature and its features, including the shell, seem to interact with the light from the setting sun, creating shadows on the water. The illumination appears consistent with the sunlight's direction from the right horizon, aligning with the sun depicted in the background, providing coherence to the light and shadow interplay.",
