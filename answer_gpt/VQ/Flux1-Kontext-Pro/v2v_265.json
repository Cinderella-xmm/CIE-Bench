      "question": "Does the cartoon locomotive maintain the structural coherence of the original train without introducing broken or distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon locomotive maintains structural coherence reflective of an actual locomotive. The shapes of the locomotive are rounded and simplified in a chibi style, which means that while they are stylized, the elements like the body, windows, and wheels are proportionate and logically placed, preserving the integrity of a typical train structure. No broken or awkwardly distorted shapes are present in the edited image, indicating that the train structure is consistent and coherent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive harmonize well with the slightly stylized yet semi-realistic countryside background without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the locomotive is depicted in a 3D chibi style with bright colors and smooth textures, which is consistent with a cartoonish aesthetic. This style matches the slightly stylized countryside background, which features vivid colors, rounded hills, and cartoon flowers, all of which complement the stylized appearance of the locomotive. Both the train and the background share a coherent artistic style, ensuring that the train does not appear out of place.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive natural and free from any obvious artifacts or unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon locomotive features textures that are smooth and consistent with the 3D chibi style. The details such as the panels, grills, and lights are simplified, but do not contain any obvious artifacts or unnatural patterns. This type of texturing aligns with common practices in cartoon-style 3D modeling, where simplicity is key to maintaining a clean and cohesive appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the rolling green hills, bright blue sky, and colorful flowers in the background appear visually plausible and consistent with the semi-realistic environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features rolling green hills, a bright blue sky with fluffy clouds, and colorful flowers, all depicted in a semi-realistic manner but stylized to match the cartoon theme. The colors are vivid and the forms are smooth, resembling a more fantasy-oriented depiction rather than a strictly realistic one. This harmony between elements contributes to a believable and consistent semi-realistic cartoon environment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the edited image, including the 3D chibi-style cartoon locomotive and the new countryside background, look authentic and free from any obvious inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B presents a harmonious blend between the cartoon locomotive and the idyllic countryside background. Both elements are rendered in a consistent 3D chibi style, ensuring the colors, textures, and aesthetic are aligned. The lack of clashing elements or unrealistic discrepancies between foreground and background confirms that the composition feels authentic and cohesive.",
