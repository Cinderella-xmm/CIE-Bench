    "Question": "Q1: Does the enlarged head appear natural and maintain structural coherence without distortion or unnatural stretching?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the head relative to the body are exaggerated, common in chibi or bobblehead designs where the head is significantly larger for stylistic reasons. This is a deliberate choice in this type of figure, making any apparent distortion or unnatural stretching purposeful for the style. The head appears to be smoothly integrated without structural distortion, matching common design tropes for such figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the cartoonified body free of obvious artifacts and maintains a certain sense of realism?",
    "explanation": "The body in Image B is small and simplified, consistent with a bobblehead or figurine style. It is cartoonified, yet this style is typical for such figures that aim for a compact and playful aesthetic. There are no visible artifacts that disrupt the toy-like realism, indicating a consistent stylistic execution.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the positioning of the bobblehead on the bookshelf look visually plausible and structurally consistent with the background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bobblehead figure is placed on a bookshelf beside books. The shadows and lighting conform to those of an object naturally placed on a shelf, contributing to a visually plausible and consistent appearance with the background. Its positioning respects gravity and spatial arrangements typical in such settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Has the face retained its accuracy with no loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "Even though the face is blurred, the question can be interpreted to assess whether there could be issues if not blurred. In Image B, given the style, the face would have been artfully modified to fit the bobblehead design, but typically, such figurines maintain recognizable features within that exaggeration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the combination of an accurate face and a cartoonified body achieve coherence and natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the style attempts to blend an oversize head with a cartoonified body, typical of bobbleheads. While the face is blurred, the intended design retains stylistic coherence in combining these elements, achieving the desired playful and cohesive toy-like appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
