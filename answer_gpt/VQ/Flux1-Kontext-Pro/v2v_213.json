      "question": "Do the wings of the butterfly retain their natural texture and pattern without any visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings of the butterfly exhibit a smooth, consistent texture and pattern that closely resembles a natural butterfly. The coloration appears uniform and the patterns are symmetrical, which is characteristic of butterfly wings. There are no visible signs of digital artifacts or inconsistencies that would suggest an unnatural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the butterfly's body and wings consistent with its natural form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the butterfly's body and wings appear proportionate and accurately shaped, similar to what would be expected from a natural butterfly. The symmetrical positioning of the wings and even distribution of patterns further support that there is no noticeable distortion or deformation present.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the lighting and shading on the butterfly in the 3D model appear natural and consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B provides a soft, even distribution across the butterfly, which aligns well with how light naturally interacts with such surfaces. The shadows and highlights are subtle and maintain a realistic look, comparable to the original image lighting without noticeable deviations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as the patterns on the wings and the texture of the body, been preserved without any loss or distortion in the 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the patterns on the butterfly wings are clear and detailed, with sharp definition in the markings. The body's texture retains a realistic appearance and detail, similar to that seen in a real butterfly. There appears to be no loss of detail or distortion when compared to a natural depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and placement of the butterfly in the 3D model appear visually plausible and coherent within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The butterfly in Image B is centrally placed against a neutral background, allowing it to stand out clearly, which is common for showcasing models. The orientation and size in relation to the background are appropriate and create a coherent visual presentation without any disproportionate elements.",
