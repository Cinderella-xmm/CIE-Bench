      "question": "Does the glass candle chamber maintain consistent transparency and refractive qualities with natural glass, and are the embossed gold floral motifs clearly defined without distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image, Image B, shows a teapot with detailed gold floral motifs against a red background. The motifs are clearly defined and intricate, suggesting a similar appearance to natural embossed metal work. Although not made of glass, the red ceramic of the teapot and the gold elements are visually consistent and the motifs lack distortion, indicating a well-crafted appearance. Natural glass typically has specific refractive qualities which don't apply here, but the teapot itself maintains clarity and detail.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot displays a rich, deep red hue, which is evenly distributed over the body of the teapot. This color is visually harmonious with the gold detailing, providing a well-contrasted and aesthetically pleasing appearance. There isn't evidence of abrupt color shifts or unnatural saturation, suggesting that the color integration is skillfully managed to blend with the gold elements.",

      "question": "Does the wooden lid accurately reflect the contour and curvature of the original teapot handle, and does it display natural wood grain and polish without visible artifacts or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a wooden handle with visible wood grain and polish that appears natural and refined. The handle features smooth curvature that aligns well with the overall aesthetics of the teapot. There is no evidence of geometric distortion or digital artifacts, indicating a faithful representation in both contour and texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the brand logo positioned on the base in a way that aligns with the existing decorative elements, and does it lack jagged edges, misalignment, or unnatural contrast that would suggest digital insertion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a clear brand logo positioned on the base of the teapot, focusing instead on the design and craftsmanship of the teapot itself. There is no misalignment or unnatural elements apparent, as the image centers on the decorative elements without signage or artificial logos.",

      "question": "Does the newly added patterned fabric background exhibit consistent texture, proper lighting interaction, and seamless integration with the teapot's shadow and reflection on the surface below, without visible seams or lighting discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric background features a rich, patterned design that is consistent in texture, interacting well with the lighting. The teapot's shadow and reflection are integrated smoothly against the pattern, showing no visible seams or lighting discrepancies. The overall composition suggests a seamless integration where the fabric complements the teapot's aesthetic without any discord.",
