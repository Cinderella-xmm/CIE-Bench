      "question": "Does the enhanced chandelier retain its symmetrical structure and realistic crystal texture, with no visible distortion or irregularities in its shape or lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chandelier in Image B maintains its symmetrical structure as observed in its uniform drop elements and arms that radiate from the center, similar to typical chandeliers. The lighting reflections are natural, with appropriate highlights and shadows that suggest a three-dimensional crystal texture. This observation aligns with the characteristics of a well-maintained chandelier.",

      "question": "Do the silhouette figures in the audience retain recognizable human postures and relative spacing, avoiding unnatural clustering or elongation that would compromise spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures in the audience are uniformly spaced and exhibit typical human postures, such as sitting upright. The silhouettes do not display any significant distortion or clustering that would detract from the realistic depiction of a theater audience.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone evenly applied across all surfaces, maintaining visible texture differences between materials such as the wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling, without introducing muddy or oversaturated areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia tone in Image B is applied consistently, allowing for the textures to remain distinguishable. The wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling each retain unique textural details, such as the sheen of the piano and the ornate appearance of the ceiling. There is no evidence of oversaturation or muddiness, which supports a balanced application of sepia tone.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grand piano is positioned centrally on the stage, with its form displaying a coherent perspective that follows the contours of a grand piano. The legs are intact and proportionate, and the shadowing from the overhead light source reinforces its placement on the stage, avoiding any appearance of floating or deformation.",
