    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) proportionally accurate and anatomically consistent with the original child's face, without any unnatural stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question is about the facial features, which are blurred in the edited image. Hence, determining proportional accuracy and anatomical consistency with the original is not possible. However, based on available visual cues unrelated to the blurred face, the rest of the edited image reflects characteristics of a classic portrait style, which typically aims for anatomical accuracy. The gown, hair, and background indicate careful attention to detail, suggesting the edited facial features would be proportionally accurate as well.",

      "question": "Does the gown exhibit natural fabric folds and shadows that follow the body’s contours, with no abrupt edges or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the gown is presented with detailed embroidery and fabric folds that appear natural and follow the body's contours seamlessly. The lighting creates shadows consistent with natural draping, showing attention to anatomical form without any abrupt edges or texture inconsistencies. The folds and embroidery details are artistically rendered to give an impression of depth and realism, typical of classic portraits.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image displays hair with a smooth, reflective surface that maintains natural-looking volume and strand separation.
