      "question": "Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the thermometer retains a consistent, smooth circular shape, which is a crucial aspect of structural integrity. The markings and numbers are evenly spaced, and the needle appears proportionate and well-placed. The image gives a polished 3D cartoon appeal without any visible distortions or broken areas, maintaining structural consistency. This indicates that the 3D cartoon style is applied while preserving the structural attributes of the thermometer.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the thermometer's metal frame in Image B is subtle, creating a gentle highlight that suggests a natural metallic finish. The light reflection does not overwhelm or obscure other aspects of the image, ensuring that the details like the temperature markings remain clear and legible. This suggests a skillful application of lighting effects that enhance the overall appearance by highlighting the metal finish realistically.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspecting Image B, no explicit temperature range or accuracy stats such as [Temperature Range +200] or [Accuracy +10°C] are visible within the design. This suggests that either such elements are not intended to appear in the image or they exist elsewhere not readily apparent. Therefore, there's no basis to evaluate their integration or any resulting clutter or distortion from such additions, indicating the need for an option acknowledging their absence.",

      "question": "Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner 'PRECISION THERMAL GAUGE' and the nameplate 'THERMOMETER' are clearly visible above and below the thermometer, respectively. Their contrasting colors against the cool-toned background ensure readability. The text is centralized relative to the thermometer and does not encroach on the thermometer's space, maintaining visual balance and enhancing the design's clarity and professionalism.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image features a cool-toned blue background with crisp borders encasing the thermometer, which amplifies the readability and focus on the thermometer. This color choice and delineated space align with common design practices aimed at creating a clean, professional appearance, enhancing the thermometer's functional and aesthetic appeal. There are no visible visual artifacts, indicating a well-executed design.",
