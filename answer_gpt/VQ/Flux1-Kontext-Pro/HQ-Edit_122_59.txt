    "Question": "Q1: Is the elephant's size reduced proportionally so that its limbs, head, and body maintain correct relative proportions and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant appears to have been proportionally miniaturized. The limbs, head, and body maintain their correct relative proportions, as indicated by the consistent flow of the contours and the absence of any visually apparent distortions. The proportions of its features—the length of its legs relative to its body, the size of the head, and trunk—are appropriate, ensuring that it doesn't appear stretched or compressed. This coherence is crucial for maintaining the aesthetic integrity of a reduced model.",
