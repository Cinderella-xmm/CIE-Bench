    "Question": "Q1: Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and roof supports are depicted in a stylized form with sharp, clean edges that are consistent with a structured geometric design. There are no visible signs of warping or fracturing in the beams or supports. The use of gold accents emphasizes the edges, enhancing the perception of sharpness and consistency. This consistent representation aligns with common artistic depictions of architectural structures that prioritize clean lines and structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the moon is depicted as a stylized circle with a smooth, consistent outline and a uniform glow created by the artist's use of line radiance around it. There is no jagged outline or uneven brightness present. This artistic rendition emphasizes a perfect circular form typical in stylized or decorative artwork focused on symmetry and uniformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plants in the foreground and background do not appear to follow symmetrical, repeating patterns. Instead, they exhibit natural variations in shape and spacing, which is characteristic of realistic plant growth patterns. The lack of uniformity suggests an intention to depict a more natural landscape setting, without artificial patterning.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden surfaces are accented with metallic gold outlines, enhancing the structural features. However, there are no metallic colors like silver present, nor is there evidence of reflective sheen synonymous with metallic materials. The texture and detail of the wood are consistent with artistic style but lack the sheen and reflection typically associated with metallic surfaces. The window panes do not show metallic accents, maintaining the overall theme and design consistency.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the windowâ€™s structural integrity?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not depict visible clouds. The focus is on the architectural elements, where the window frames do show bold, angular lines. These lines align with the overall geometric and stylized architectural style depicted in the image, maintaining the structural integrity without any breakage. The emphasis on angular design is consistent with the artistic style presented.",
    "answer": "No"
