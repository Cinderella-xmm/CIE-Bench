    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the iridescent emerald and gold feather patterns follow the natural feather alignment and texture of the owl’s body, without creating blocky or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the second image, the feathers maintain a realistic alignment and texture consistent with the natural arrangement seen in owls. The colors blend smoothly into the body, avoiding sharp or blocky transitions, particularly in the emerald and gold hues. World knowledge informs us that the overall feather pattern should mimic natural configurations to avoid looking artificial.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mist-like wing extensions connected smoothly to the owl’s body and shaped in accordance with the original wing outline, without floating or detached segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the wing extensions appear seamlessly connected to the owl's body, following the expected contours of its wings. The extensions are integrated smoothly into the existing structure without any detached or floating segments, which aligns with natural wing anatomy inferred through world knowledge.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the rune-like markings integrated into the feather pattern such that they follow the natural contours of the owl’s body and do not disrupt the texture or appear as separate graphic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runes in the edited image are embedded within the feather pattern in a way that harmonizes with the owl's contours. They do not appear as separate graphical elements but blend naturally with the texture of the feathers, a process helped by world knowledge of design integration techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the eyes retain their original oval shape and pupil structure while displaying a soft, glowing light with visible moon-like reflections, without excessive brightness or halo artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl's eyes in the edited image maintain their natural oval shape and pupil structure. The glow is soft and subtle, consistent with moon-like reflections, avoiding harsh brightness levels that would produce unwanted artifacts or halos, aligned with expectations of natural eye features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vines wrapped naturally around the owl’s talons, with gems placed at logical junctions along the vines and no clipping or misalignment with the claws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines visible in the edited image are positioned naturally around the talons, with gems thoughtfully placed at logical points. There is no evidence of clipping or alignment issues, consistent with real-world vine wrapping around a perch and using design elements that respect anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the entire owl, including its transformed features, maintain proportional alignment with the original body structure and perch, without elongation, compression, or misplacement of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the owl's proportions are kept intact with respect to its body structure and perch positioning. The added features do not impose distortions like elongation or compression; limbs are appropriately placed, according to world knowledge of anatomical consistency in birds.",
