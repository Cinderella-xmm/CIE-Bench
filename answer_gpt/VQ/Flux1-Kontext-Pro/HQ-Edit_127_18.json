      "question": "Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vintage travel case is visible as it forms the container for the diorama. The integration of the caseâ€™s boundaries into the scene is noticeable due to the distinct lines and edges that define its shape. The perspective and lighting appear consistent, ensuring no abrupt changes that draw attention away from the immersive diorama setting, suggesting that the integration is seamless.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts textured resin grass with noticeable variations in blade length and angle, giving it a more natural appearance. The shadows cast are soft and consistent with the apparent lighting direction, providing a realistic representation of grass under light.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature acacia tree is smaller than the elephant model, but its placement relative to the elephant within the diorama space gives a convincing sense of scale. The perspective and spatial arrangement contribute to a believable diorama setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows painted clouds on the inner surface of the case lid. The clouds lack specular highlights or shadows that would indicate three-dimensional properties, supporting the idea that they are flat and not floating within the scene, consistent with the diorama setup.",
      "weight": 1,

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass compass in the diorama of Image B is placed flat on the sand-like base. Its reflection and shadow seem aligned with the overarching light direction, matching the surface texture of the base and enhancing the realism of the setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elephant model in Image B maintains a realistic texture resembling natural skin, with correctly proportioned limbs and tusks that are curved naturally. There are no visible deformations or pixelations, preserving the detail and quality expected in a replica.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the objects within the diorama, such as the elephant, grass, and trees, all seem to fall in the same direction with a similar softness. This consistency suggests illumination from a single light source positioned above, supporting a cohesive and naturalistic lighting scheme.",
