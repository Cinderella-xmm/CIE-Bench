      "question": "Does the transparent acrylic display case show no visible distortion, reflection anomalies, or refraction errors that affect the appearance of the McLaren?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the McLaren is placed inside a transparent acrylic display case which can sometimes cause distortion or reflection anomalies. By analyzing Image B, the surface of the display case is quite clear, and the McLaren appears as it would be expected without distortion. The transparency of the display case is maintained well, and there are no visible issues like refraction errors that considerably alter the car's appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the polished chrome base aligned with the car's position and does it reflect light and surroundings naturally without appearing disconnected or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the McLaren model sitting on a polished base that appears dark rather than notably chrome reflecting light as expected from a high-gloss or chrome surface which was not mentioned in the question. The reflection and alignment with the base appear normal and do not exhibit any unnatural disconnections or distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the carbon fiber textures confined to the interior walls of the display case and do they exhibit consistent, non-repeating patterns without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior walls of the display case exhibit carbon fiber textures. The textures appear to be consistent with a typical carbon fiber pattern and do not show repeating artifacts that would be visually jarring or unnatural. This consistency is visible across the interiors of the case, providing an authentic appearance without detectable visual errors.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature wrenches and screwdrivers proportionally accurate compared to the McLaren and positioned in a way that suggests intentional placement without floating or clipping through surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, miniature wrenches and screwdrivers are displayed inside the case. These tools are proportionally small compared to the McLaren model, suggesting an intentional scale as they are designed to be miniature. Additionally, their placement seems deliberate, and they do not appear to be floating or clipping through any surfaces within the display. This suggests careful design intended to complement the overall presentation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the laser-etched cityscape silhouette positioned at a consistent depth behind the car and display case, with no overlapping or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laser-etched cityscape silhouette visible in Image B is positioned behind the car within the display case. The silhouette maintains a consistent position and does not show signs of overlap or clipping issues with the car, maintaining a coherent design aesthetic. This positioning creates a seamless background appearance without visual interruptions or depth inconsistencies.",
