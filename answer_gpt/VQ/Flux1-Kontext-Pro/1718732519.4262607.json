      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog uniformly shaped, properly aligned, and free of distorted or misshapen pieces that compromise structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hot dog appears to be constructed from LEGO bricks, which are known for their uniform shape and ability to fit together consistently. The hot dog is shown with a smooth outline and evenly aligned LEGO pieces, demonstrating proper connection and alignment typical of LEGO construction. The pieces do not appear distorted or misshapen, and the structure is consistent, indicative of LEGO’s precision design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the ceramic mosaic bottle feature smooth, non-glass-like surfaces with clearly defined geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan, without unnatural reflections or transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle wrapped in LEGO bricks forming a mosaic pattern. The surface of the bottle does not have the glossy, reflective quality one might expect of ceramic or glass. Instead, the bricks create a clearly defined geometric pattern using LEGO brick colors, including red, yellow, and blue (not tan as stated). The surface characteristics align more with LEGO than ceramic, lacking the typical transparency or reflections of glass.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the LEGO hot dog's length proportionally consistent with the original hot dog’s size relative to the cutting board and nearby objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO hot dog is placed on a wooden cutting board, similar to Image A's hot dog. The hot dog's length is proportionately aligned with the size of the board and the relative scale of surrounding objects, such as the bottle and the table, maintaining the same proportional relationship as seen in Image A. The LEGO hot dog closely mimics the scale and alignment of the original hot dog on the cutting board.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ceramic bottle have a rounded, flowing shape with no sharp angles or blocky geometry that would disrupt visual harmony with the LEGO hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B is made with LEGO bricks, which are inherently blocky. Thus, the bottle has a stepped, angular appearance due to the nature of the bricks forming its structure. This results in a distinctly geometric and blocky form, not the rounded, flowing shape typical of ceramic bottles. This geometry is visually coherent with the LEGO hot dog, but it contradicts the description of a ceramic bottle with a smooth, rounded shape.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden base under both the LEGO hot dog and ceramic bottle seamless, with consistent wood grain and color matching the surrounding table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base shown in Image B under the hot dog appears as a separate cutting board placed on the table. The wood grain and color of this board are similar to the surface of the table, suggesting some consistency. However, upon comparison with Image A, there is no clear visual indication of the base being seamlessly integrated with the surrounding table surface. Instead, it appears as a distinct item placed upon the table, maintaining its own color and slight differentiation in grain.",
