      "question": "Does the keychain with the chibi-style German Shepherd appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain design features a stylized cartoon-like German Shepherd which is intended to be distinctly vibrant and playful. Even though it contrasts with the realism of the surrounding elements, it is realistic within its own context as a keychain meant to be visually interesting and appealing. The artistic style does not disrupt the scene purposefully, as it aligns with everyday objects that incorporate stylized designs.",
