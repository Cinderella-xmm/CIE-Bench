      "question": "Do the extended page edges blend naturally into the frame without introducing any unnatural breaks or abrupt transitions at the corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the extended page edges appear to blend naturally into the frame of the image. The transition from the page edges to the frame is smooth, and there are no visible breaks or abrupt transitions at the corners. The alignment and integration of the extended pages maintain coherence with the original edge contour and lines of the book, which is essential for a natural appearance. Such seamless merging indicates thoughtful editing, which avoids any discord between the original and extended elements within the image's frame.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved shadow cast by the extended pages follow the lighting direction present in the original image, contributing to a natural perception of depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow cast by the extended pages is consistent with the lighting present in the original image. The original image reveals lighting coming from one direction, leading to specific light and shadow patterns. The extended shadows mirror these patterns, maintaining consistency in position and intensity. This alignment with the existing lighting direction helps maintain depth perception and ensures that the shadow does not look out of place or artificially manipulated.",

      "question": "Are the texture and fine details of the extended pages consistent with the original pages, with no visible loss or distortion of the text and paper grain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the texture and fine details of the extended pages, including the text and paper grain, are consistent with those on the original pages. The clarity and print sharpness are maintained in both the original and extended parts, and the texture appears to be continuous without distortion or unnatural deviation in paper grain or text appearance. This attention to detail suggests high-quality editing that aligns with the real physical attributes of the pages.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the curvature of the extended pages consistent with the perspective of the original image, creating a believable unfolding effect without distorting the geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curvature of the extended pages in Image B follows the perspective seen in the original image. The book is open and lays flat against the table; thus, the pages naturally curve slightly upward at the center peak. The extension respects this curvature, seamlessly integrating with the original angle and perspective, and does not introduce any geometric distortion. This accurate perspective creates a believable unfolding effect, ensuring the realism of the image isn't compromised.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the base of the book and the wooden table appear natural, with no unrealistic gaps or overlaps introduced by the extension of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interaction between the base of the book and the wooden table appears natural. The base of the book sits flush with the table surface, and there are no visible unrealistic gaps or overlaps observed between these elements. The slight indentations and shadows where the book meets the table surface are consistent with the physics of two objects resting against each other. This careful attention suggests that the photoshopped extensions of the pages have been well-integrated at the point of contact, maintaining the natural look of objects in a real-world setting.",
