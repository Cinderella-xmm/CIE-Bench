    "Question": "Q1: Are the individual bead segments aligned in a smooth, continuous curve that mimics the natural curvature of a serpent's body without abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beads form a necklace that is arranged in a smooth and continuous circular pattern. This circular arrangement appears to mimic a natural curve and lacks any abrupt angular breaks or misaligned joints. Each bead is closely aligned with the next, providing a coherent flow which is reminiscent of the natural curvature found in a serpent's body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the blue circular elements positioned at the head end of the serpent in a symmetrical, forward-facing arrangement typical of animal eyes, and do they appear integrated into the surface rather than floating or disconnected?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace does not visibly simulate the head of a serpent as it is arranged in a consistent circular loop with beads that have blue circular patterns throughout. There's no discernible head with forward-facing eye-like features; instead, the pattern is uniform across the entire strand. Thus, the blue elements are not positioned to resemble animal eyes at a serpent's head.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the black tribal markings follow the natural flow of the serpent’s body segments and avoid sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that suggests digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the black tribal markings appear on each individual bead with a repetitive pattern. These markings follow the shape of the beads consistently along the strand. The transition and flow of these patterns are harmonious with the overall circular formation of the beads without any sharp, unnatural edges or uniform repetition that would suggest digital irregularities.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the tail extend naturally from the rear of the serpent, tapering smoothly and ending in small, loosely connected bead-like tips that appear to hang or sway without breaking the continuity of the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the formation is a closed loop, characteristic of a necklace, and each end of the strands is knotted, suggesting the closure of a string of beads rather than tapering into a tail structure. There is no specific segment that extends or tapers to form a tail in a manner that suggests natural continuity or swaying movement.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the surface texture of the serpent’s body uniformly matte or slightly glossy like the original beads, without introducing areas of unnatural shine, roughness, or inconsistent material properties?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the beads have a consistent surface texture that appears slightly glossy, similar to ceramic or polished clay beads. This consistency is maintained across all the beads without any areas showing unnatural shine or roughness. The texture observed is uniform, and no inconsistencies in material properties are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"
