    "Question": "Q1: Are the chibi-style 3D models of the sheep and clock free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the sheep and clock are modeled in a chibi style and are enclosed within a snow globe. The sheep's wool texture appears soft and consistent with its chibi-style portrayal, without any oddities or unrealistic elements. The clock in the snow globe shows clear and crisp numbers and hands, which compliments this style well. Together, these details confirm that both models are free from unnatural textures and maintain their fine details.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Does the sheep appear naturally leaning against the clock without any distortion or unnatural positioning?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep is positioned adjacent to the clock inside the snow globe. Its stance is natural and relaxed, standing on its own, rather than leaning. This spatial arrangement is well-executed and does not show any signs of distortion or unnatural positioning, creating a seamless appearance within the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the gently drifting snowflakes inside the snow globe add to the scene naturally without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the interior of the snow globe in Image B, the snowflakes are depicted as small white speckles distributed throughout. These snowflakes enhance the scene without introducing any visual artifacts or inconsistencies. Their integration into the background and around the sheep and clock contributes naturally to the whimsical and classic snow globe atmosphere.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the proportions and physical relationships between the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop consistent and logical?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe, sheep, clock, and tabletop maintain consistent proportions and a logical relationship. The snow globe is appropriately sized for holding both the sheep and the clock, without overcrowding. The sheep and clock are positioned in a balanced manner inside it, and the size relation to the tabletop is proportionately realistic. This configuration adheres to logical spatial characteristics commonly observed in decorative snow globes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
