      "question": "Does the tutu maintain a balanced, layered structure with no visible warping or collapsed sections that suggest digital distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, by examining the tutu, one can see that it maintains a consistent shape and structure throughout. The tutu appears evenly layered, with no visible inconsistencies or distortions, similar to a traditional ballerina's tutu which typically retains its poise and form. There are no signs of digital editing errors such as warping or collapsing.",

      "question": "Are the glitter elements seamlessly blended into the tutu and bodice, showing natural variation in size and brightness without pixelation or unnatural clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glitter elements on the tutu and bodice appear well-integrated, showing a natural dispersion and variation in size and brightness. The glitter details do not show any pixelation or clumping that would indicate poor blending or digital editing flaws. This aligns with how glitter would naturally reflect light and scatter irregularly across a fabric.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background gradient smooth and continuous, with no visible banding or abrupt color shifts that separate it from the subjectâ€™s silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B shows a smooth and consistent gradient. There are no harsh lines or banding that suggests abrupt color transitions. The gradient blends seamlessly with the subject's silhouette, which is crucial to maintain the image's aesthetic integrity and focus on the subject.",

      "question": "Are the blank message areas fully opaque and aligned with the image plane, with no visible edge artifacts or texture disruption beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The message areas in Image B appear fully opaque and are well-aligned with the rest of the image. There are no visible artifacts along the edges, and the alignment does not disrupt the image's texture, indicating a clean overlay that integrates well with the rest of the visual elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the floral motifs along the borders stay within the frame boundaries and maintain consistent scale and orientation without intersecting the ballerina or floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral motifs are positioned neatly along the borders of the frames. They respect the frame's limits, maintaining their scale and orientation without overlapping into the main subject or the floor area. This ensures that the motifs serve as decorative elements without intruding into the focus of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, both hands of the ballerina clearly show five distinct and correctly proportioned fingers. The fingers are naturally spaced and curved, with no signs of digital editing issues like extra or fused digits, maintaining anatomical correctness.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina's feet are positioned en pointe, displaying natural arches, and the toes appear correctly aligned. The supporting leg is properly straight without unnatural bending, reflecting the typical posture expected in classical ballet, which supports the dancer's balance and form.",
