      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the figurine exhibit a uniform glossy finish consistent with ceramic material, without patches of retained knit texture or uneven sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the figurine appears smooth and shiny, indicative of a ceramic finish. There are no visible patches of knit texture, and the sheen seems consistent across the entire surface. This is in contrast to Image A, where the object has a clearly knit texture and matte finish.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the terracotta color applied uniformly across the entire body of the figurine, without streaks, discoloration, or mismatched tones in different areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figurine with a consistent terracotta color applied uniformly over its entire body. There are no noticeable streaks, discoloration, or mismatched tones, unlike Image A, which features a more uniform color with the natural fiberâ€™s beige tone.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the floral engravings clearly defined, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly embedded into the surface of the figurine without causing geometric distortions or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the figurine in Image B shows engravings, although they are not floral, but rather random indecipherable patterns. They are clearly defined and part of the surface texture, without visible geometric distortions or overlaps, unlike Image A which shows a plain knit texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the amber-colored eyes have a smooth, polished appearance with appropriate reflection and depth, and are they correctly positioned within the facial structure without appearing displaced or oversized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's amber-colored eyes are smooth and polished, showing appropriate reflection and depth. They are positioned in a way that corresponds well to the figurine's facial structure, unlike in Image A which features similar eyes but on a knit texture.",

      "question": "Is the figurine resting flat on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and natural shadowing beneath it, indicating proper physical support and spatial coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is placed on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and shadowing beneath, indicating that it is resting flat and demonstrating spatial coherence. This is different from Image A, where the object is held in a hand.",
