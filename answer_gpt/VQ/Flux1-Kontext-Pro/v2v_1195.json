      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being converted into a stained glass style, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard is rendered with a stained glass effect, characterized by visible lines and geometric shapes typical of stained glass art. The skateboard, though abstracted, retains its overall silhouette and essential features such as the deck and wheels. The stained glass style introduces a slightly fragmented appearance, yet does not lead to a loss of the skateboard's recognizable form, thus maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the kitchen sink and cabinets preserved without distortion, maintaining their physical rationality in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitchen sink and cabinets are depicted with stained glass effects, applying color sections divided by strong outlines. The sink and cabinets retain their linear geometry and right angles, key for maintaining their rational appearance and physical aspect as functional kitchen utilities. Despite the artistic style, the shapes do not show evident distortion, implying that their geometric integrity is preserved.",

      "question": "Does the stained glass effect applied to the countertop and backsplash tiles appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the countertop and backsplash with a stained glass effect, detailed with colored segments bordered by outlines. The tiles of the backsplash present varied colors but maintain a coherent layout typical for stained glass. Even though the style transforms the surface into a mosaic-like appearance, no obvious artifacts or jarring textures challenge the stained glass style's authenticity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets visually credible and coherent, without any noticeable breaks or inconsistencies in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets is handled with colored segments and outlines that define stained glass art. The transition appears smooth; each component is distinct while still aligning with the overall stained glass theme, without glaring breaks or inconsistencies. The color palette and stroke thickness across these objects remain consistent, ensuring a cohesive visual transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details of the objects, such as the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles, remain authentic and detailed within the stained glass style, avoiding any degradation of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles are depicted with stained glass effects, retaining essential details like shapes and positioning. The stained glass technique simplifies their appearance with bold outlines but does not excessively degrade or oversimplify these features, allowing them to still be recognized and aligned with their expected form and details.",
