    "Question": "Q1:Does the keychain appear to be naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The keychain is held by a hand, suggesting that its integration into the scene is physically plausible. The lighting and shadow effects on the keychain and the surrounding environment are naturally consistent, indicating no signs of digital artifacts or unnatural textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the keychain's features consistent with the chibi-style representation of the subject, preserving structural coherence and visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "The chibi style is characterized by simplified and exaggerated features, often making subjects appear cuter with oversized elements and bold outlines. The keychain maintains these aspects with defined black outlines and larger proportions relative to usual proportions, while staying consistent with common chibi design traits.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the keychain maintain essential details that make the subject recognizable, avoiding distortions such as broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The keychain captures recognizable features of the subject, such as the blue and yellow headscarf and pearl earring, without distortion or broken geometric shapes. The structural elements are coherent and visible, contributing to maintaining the identity of the subject.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the materials of the keychain, specifically the soft rubber texture and bold black outlines, accurately represented without introducing unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The keychain displays typical characteristics of a soft rubber texture, such as smooth surfaces and uniform coloring. The bold black outlines are clear and consistent, aligning with typical chibi keychain design and not introducing any unnatural textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the small silver keyring attached to the keychain appear proportionally correct and physically plausible, contributing to the overall visual plausibility?",
    "explanation": "The silver keyring attached to the keychain is proportionally suitable for the size of the object it is attached to and appears physically plausible in its position and interactions with the keychain. It contributes to the visual plausibility without any abnormal distortions or positioning.",
    "answer": "Yes"
