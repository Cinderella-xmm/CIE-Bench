      "question": "Does the gold banana appear naturally integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the banana has a gold texture with visible swirling patterns that give it a more painterly and stylized appearance compared to natural textures. The gold color is vibrant and integrates well into the overall surreal color scheme, maintaining a consistent aesthetic with the rest of the image. This seamless integration into the scene suggests use of consistent textural elements throughout the image. No artifacts or unnatural textures disrupt the visual harmony.",

      "question": "Are the liquefying textures applied to the blue figure natural, without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue figure in Image B is rendered in a stylized manner, with the liquefying textures contributing to an artistic and fluid aesthetic. The liquefying effect adds a dynamic quality that aligns with imaginative design while maintaining recognizable forms. Despite transitioning into a painterly style, the essence of the form is preserved without notable distortion that undermines natural human texture.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features swirling patterns and vibrant colors that enhance the fantastical and painterly theme consistent with the image's surrealist style. While the patterns are fluid and abstract, they maintain a coherent structure without any broken or disjointed shapes, providing a visually appealing backdrop.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of elements in the surrealist-style painting maintain visual credibility and avoid any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B exhibits a coherent layout where elements like the blue figure and the gold banana are integrated seamlessly into the scene. The varied textures and colors serve to enhance rather than distort the visual narrative. While the image embraces a surreal genre with some abstraction, it maintains visual credibility within its artistic context.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the banana is depicted with a stylistic touch, yet retains human characteristics like the correct number of fingers, and adheres to general anatomical proportions. The hand maintains ergonomic conformity, naturally supporting the banana, and aligns with the aesthetic intent of the image without any anatomical inaccuracies.",
