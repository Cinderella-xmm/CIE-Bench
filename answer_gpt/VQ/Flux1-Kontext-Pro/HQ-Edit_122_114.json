      "question": "Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cogs and gears in Image B are visible in the nest structure surrounding the stork. A well-aligned and interlocked configuration should show the gears fitting closely together with continuity in their teeth and alignment. In Image B, while the gears are integrated into the nest, some appear not to interlock perfectly, with visible gaps and floating elements disrupting the geometric continuity. This implies that the alignment is not flawless.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the copper pipes are integrated along the roof line. For physical plausibility, the pipes should maintain a consistent thickness, follow the geometry of the roof edges smoothly without abrupt bends and should connect securely to the house structure. In Image B, the copper pipes seem to maintain consistent thickness and align with the roof edges without evident floating segments, indicating a physically plausible integration.",

      "question": "Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stork in Image B is covered with metallic plates, which should mirror the natural contours of a bird's anatomy for realistic depiction. These plates must overlap naturally, respecting the bird's body contours and avoiding unnatural gaps or overlaps. Image B shows the plates aligned smoothly along the stork’s curves with minimal visible gaps or misalignment given the position, suggesting an anatomically consistent covering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For realistic and functional mechanical joints on a stork, they need to be positioned at anatomical pivot points, like the neck base, wing bases, and leg joints, allowing for movement within a bird’s natural motion range. In Image B, the mechanical features at these points do not appear misplaced or distorted, implying they follow the movement framework of a real bird adequately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For harmonious integration, mechanical elements like cogs and pipes should respect the scale of the wooden house, neither appearing too large nor unsupported. In Image B, the cogs within the nest are in proportion to the house and supported by a combination of the wooden and mechanical structures. Thus, the integration maintains proportional harmony, with no component appearing disproportionately large or floating.",
