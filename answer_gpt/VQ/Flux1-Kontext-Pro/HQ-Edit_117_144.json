      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden scepter in the man's right hand have a smooth, reflective metallic surface that matches the lighting conditions without exhibiting unnatural texture artifacts or inconsistent highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scepter is designed to resemble a golden staff with an intricate top and smooth texture. The reflective quality is evident through consistent lighting highlights that follow the natural contour of the scepter, making it look like a precious metallic object with appropriate sheen. This aligns with expectations for a metallic object under sunlight, indicating the absence of texture artifacts or inconsistent highlights.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the pastel-colored fabrics of the man’s coat, vest, trousers, and shirt rendered with visible texture and depth, maintaining natural folds and shadows without appearing flat or washed out?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clothing in Image B demonstrates an effective portrayal of textile texture. The coat, vest, and trousers all have visible textures and shading that give depth to the fabrics, suggesting a thickness and natural draping. The clothing's many creases and shadows contribute to a naturally three-dimensional appearance and do not appear flat or washed-out.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cobblestones beneath the man’s feet form a continuous, evenly spaced pattern with natural irregularities and consistent shading, avoiding broken or misaligned stones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cobblestones visibly form an organized and continuously aligned pattern. Although they exhibit some natural irregularities that one would expect in real cobblestone paths, each stone maintains consistent spacing and shading that supports the realistic portrayal of such pavement without any indication of being broken or misaligned.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the detachable note sections placed along the outer edges of the image without overlapping the man or background architecture, and do they have clean, uniform borders resembling paper cutouts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detachable note sections are indeed aligned along the outer edges of the image. They do not overlap with the man or the background, and their clean, uniform borders give them the look of cutout paper, maintaining a consistent graphic aesthetic that separates them clearly from the main elements of the image.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the man’s right hand gripping the scepter show five clearly defined fingers with natural joint angles and no deformation, while the left hand in the pocket maintains a relaxed, anatomically accurate pose?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the right hand gripping the scepter shows a hand structure where the five fingers are not visually distinct, which contradicts the clarity seen in realistic depictions. The left hand, although in the pocket, appears naturally relaxed from what's visible, maintaining anatomical accuracy.",
