      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the metallic wing structures exhibit uniform reflective properties and smooth surface transitions without visible seams or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic wing structures are designed with an aesthetic of uniformity, where the reflective properties are consistent across their surfaces. This is evidenced by the even distribution of light and shadow, which suggests a smooth transition over the surfaces. There are no visible seams or abrupt texture repetitions, indicating a high-quality blend of surfaces. The patterning and reflections contribute to the illusion of a seamless design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leg-like structures derived from the minarets proportionally consistent with the rest of the structure and do they show natural curvature and joint-like articulation without stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leg-like structures appear to be well-integrated with the rest of the building's form, exhibiting proportional consistency. They are shaped with natural curvatures and articulations that mimic joint movements, avoiding any visual stretching or warping. This suggests careful attention to maintaining architectural coherence with the new elements derived from the original minarets.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the central jewel reflect light and cosmic patterns in a way that matches the direction of sunlight and surrounding environment, without appearing to float or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central jewel in Image B is designed to reflect light with an alignment that corresponds to the surrounding sunlight and cosmic patterns. It is anchored in place atop the structure, avoiding the appearance of floating. Additionally, any shadows cast by the jewel are coherent with the environmental lighting, indicating a harmonious integration with the overall scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the glowing patterns confined to surface-level details, following architectural lines, and do they emit light that blends with ambient illumination without creating harsh glows or obscuring textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing patterns are detailed to follow the architectural lines of the structure, maintaining consistency with surface-level designs. The light emitted from these patterns blends naturally with the ambient illumination, as they do not produce harsh glares or overshadow the underlying textures, ensuring a cohesive integration with the environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the junctions between the original building and the transformed elements such as wings, legs, or jewel?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any visible seams, blurring, or color discontinuities at the transitions between the original building and the newly introduced elements like wings, legs, and jewel. The integration at these junctions is seamless, both in color and texture, ensuring that the transformation appears organic and part of a single cohesive structure.",
