    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the golden wand have smooth, reflective surfaces with consistent lighting and shadows that match the surrounding environment, and is it properly connected to the reel and the fisherman’s hand without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fishing rod is depicted with careful attention to detail. The rod, resembling a wand, has a reflection that suggests a metal-like surface that reacts to the surrounding lighting, having both highlights and shadows that match the environment. The connections between the rod, reel, and the fisherman's hand seem seamless, as there are no visible gaps or distortions that suggest a disconnection. This indicates a well-rendered object that fits naturally in the environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the hat and plaid shirt visibly enhanced but still consistent with real fabric appearance, with no pixelation, stretching, or broken patterns in the weave or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and plaid shirt are depicted with realistic textures that resemble actual fabric. The patterns on the shirt show a consistent plaid design without signs of pixelation, stretching, or distortion at the seams. The weave of both the hat and the shirt are detailed and convincingly realistic, maintaining the expected consistency found in real-life materials. This suggests high-quality image rendering with attention to fabric realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the magical ripples originate from the tip of the wand and spread outward in continuous, concentric patterns that interact naturally with the water surface and reflections, without floating or disconnected wave segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, ripples are visible on the water's surface where the wand or fishing rod interacts with it. These ripples appear continuous and concentric, moving outward naturally as expected when an object touches a water surface. The ripples align with both the wand's position and the overall water reflection, showing interaction that appears physically consistent and without disjointed segments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden frame positioned around the image with correct perspective, consistent texture, and shadows that align with the scene’s lighting, and do the embossed pine tree details appear three-dimensional without distortion or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden frame surrounding the images is aligned correctly with a perspective that complements the scene inside. The texture of the wood appears realistic, featuring grain patterns and shadows consistent with the lighting of the environment. The embedded pine tree details have a three-dimensional quality, neither distorted nor clipped, suggesting an intricate frame design integrated well with the overall imagery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the fisherman’s hands show five fingers each with natural joint positioning and skin texture, and is his facial structure preserved without distortion in both the original and reflected image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fisherman's hands exhibit five fingers each, maintaining realistic anatomy with no odd proportions or mispositioned joints. The skin texture appears natural. Although the face is blurred and therefore not considered here, the facial structure in both the original and reflected image is symmetrical and consistent, aligning naturally in reflection without distortion.",
