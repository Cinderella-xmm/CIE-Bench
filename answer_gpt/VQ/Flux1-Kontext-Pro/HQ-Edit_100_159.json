      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player's muscles are more pronounced and stylized, with sharp angles and defined lines that are typical of artwork mimicking sports figures. This exaggeration aligns with a graffiti art style which often highlights certain physical features for dramatic effect. Despite this exaggeration, the proportions remain generally balanced with no clear anatomical impossibilities such as broken lines or impossible bends in the body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors applied to the player's clothing and skin consistent with the graffiti theme and do they retain visible texture and material properties without appearing flat or artificially oversaturated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the player's clothing and skin are vibrant and align well with the graffiti theme. The use of bold and vivid colors complements the background style, and the texture of the paint and the lines suggest an artistically intentional choice rather than photographic realism. There's no evidence of oversaturation that detracts from the artistic consistency of this piece.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does it grip the ball in a physically credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player's hand holding the basketball shows five fingers with a curvature and spacing that seem to naturally wrap around the ball. The illustration portrays the fingers extending over the surface in a believable grasp, consistent with how one would expect a hand to look when dribbling a basketball.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the blank graffiti-style text area clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the background graffiti, and placed in a way that does not distort the scene or obscure key elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blank graffiti-style text area is noticeable and maintains the artistic style of the surrounding graffiti, respecting the visual theme. The placement does not interfere with key elements like the player or basketball; it complements the scene by offering space for additional creative expression while keeping the overall aesthetics intact.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting, shadows, and surface textures of the player, basketball, and court consistent with each other and free from artifacts such as mismatched highlights or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows are deliberately stylized to fit the graffiti art theme, with consistent highlights and shadow works that tie together the player's form, the basketball, and the court seamlessly. The illustration adheres to a uniform style, avoiding irregularities or visual artifacts that would be present in a more realistic depiction.",
