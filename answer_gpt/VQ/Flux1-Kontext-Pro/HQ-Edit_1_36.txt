    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elderâ€™s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
    "explanation": "Based on the blurred area of the face, it is not possible to assess the natural rendering of facial wrinkles and skin texture since the image intentionally obscures these details.",
    "answer": "Not applicable due to face blurring"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the floral patterns on the hanbok and surrounding foliage display consistent detail and alignment without visible repetition or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, careful observation of the hanbok reveals floral patterns that are well-defined and detailed, showing a consistent print without visible repetition or blurring. Similarly, the surrounding foliage consists of cherry blossom patterns that look realistic and aligned, maintaining a natural appearance without any obvious signs of being repetitive or having a blurred effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the green vine accents positioned behind the subject and aligned with the depth of the background, without appearing to float above or through solid structures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green vine accents are well-integrated into the background, following the depth of field naturally and not appearing to float or interfere with the overlaid solid structures. This is noticed as they maintain a consistent background placement relative to the cherry blossoms and roofing elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the envelope frame fully aligned with the image boundaries, with no jagged edges, clipping errors, or mismatched shadowing?",
    "explanation": "The envelope and the embedded images in Image B appear to be well-aligned with defined and clean boundaries. There are no visible jagged edges, and the shadowing complements the design by being consistent and aligned, indicating precise crafting of the layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the edges of the hair, fabric folds, and floral elements sharp and clean without jagged lines, pixelation, or ghosting artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the hair, fabric folds, and floral elements appear sharp and precise. There are no signs of pixelation or jagged lines disrupting the visual/textural clarity, nor are there any ghosting artifacts that would suggest a loss in image quality.",
