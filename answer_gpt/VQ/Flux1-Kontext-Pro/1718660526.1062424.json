    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the animal consist of small, uniformly sized glossy ceramic tiles arranged in a consistent pattern that follows the contours of the original form without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body of the animal is covered with small, uniformly sized tiles that are glossy and arranged in a mosaic pattern. These tiles are aligned consistently with the contours of the animal's form, showing no visible gaps or misalignment. The uniformity in size and consistency of placement suggest careful design to maintain structural integrity, creating a smooth appearance following its shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes composed of precisely shaped tiles forming distinct white sclera and black pupils, maintaining their original size and position relative to the snout and head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are made up of tiles, with distinct white tiles forming the sclera and black tiles for the pupils. These tiles maintain the size and position of the eyes relative to the snout and head, similar to a realistic representation where proportion and placement retain fidelity to a natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the stripes across the body maintain uniform width and spacing, with clear transitions between vibrant orange and deep black tiles that match the original pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays stripes on the animal's body that exhibit uniform width and spacing, with transitions between orange and black tiles that are clear and consistent. These colors closely match the original pattern, highlighting a precise translation of the design into the mosaic form, preserving the original aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the animal a textured sandy platform with visible granular detail and subtle moisture variation, providing a tactile contrast to the smooth mosaic tiles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the animal is a sandy platform that shows visible granular detail. The sand has subtle variations in texture that might suggest moisture differences, offering a tactile and visually distinct contrast to the glossy, smooth surfaces of the mosaic tiles covering the animal.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the animal smoothly contoured with no jagged edges, distorted shapes, or missing tiles that would suggest structural inconsistency or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The limbs and joints of the animal in Image B are smoothly contoured, without jagged edges or distorted shapes. There is no evidence of missing tiles, indicating that the structural design and rendering are consistent and free of errors. The transitions between tile arrangements are smooth, demonstrating a coherent and intentional completion of the form.",
