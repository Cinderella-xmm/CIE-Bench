      "question": "Does the central green block retain its original geometric shape after being converted into a 3D chibi-style cartoon character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green block is held by one of the figures and retains its blocky rectangular form when visualized in the context of a 3D chibi-style cartoon. The block maintains the same structural features such as the stud design, albeit on a cartoon character. This suggests a retention of the original geometric shape in terms of dimensions and proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the red blocks redesigned as lively supporting characters free from unnatural textures and maintain their original structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red blocks are represented as lively, with a character even having a head shaped as a red block but with added features like a face. This transformation retains the basic shape and structure from Image A. The texture appears smooth and appropriate for a cartoon style, thus there are no unnatural textures present.",

      "question": "Does the transformed background with soft pastel colors blend naturally with the foreground elements without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B, featuring soft pink pastel colors, complements the red and green elements in the foreground. This creates a cohesive and visually pleasing composition typical for chibi-style illustrations, without any artifacts or mismatches in blending.",

      "question": "Are the heart-shaped confetti elements evenly distributed and visually plausible without causing any loss of detail in the surrounding blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heart-shaped confetti elements in Image B are scattered across the scene and do not interfere with the primary objects or cause a visual distraction. They are distributed in a manner that adds to the visual aesthetic without any evident negative impact.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the red and green blocks have been adapted to fit a chibi cartoon style. This includes smoothing of surfaces and a playful appearance. The entire image has a unified stylistic presentation without evident inconsistencies when considering typical chibi aesthetics.",
