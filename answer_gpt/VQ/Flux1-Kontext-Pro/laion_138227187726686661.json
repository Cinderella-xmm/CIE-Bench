    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the quilt display uniform square blocks with visible grid lines and a matte finish consistent with LEGO bricks, without any fabric-like folds or stitching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the quilt features a design with distinct blocks that include sports motifs and patterns, resembling a quilted fabric with noticeable stitching and folds. The presence of these fabric-like characteristics, along with the visible stitching patterns, indicates that it does not have the uniform, rigid appearance typical of LEGO bricks. The absence of grid lines consistent with LEGO pieces suggests it retains the textile nature rather than resembling LEGO components.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the round sports elements (e.g., football, soccer ball) represented as circular LEGO tiles with consistent size and alignment within the square grid, without stretching or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sports elements such as the football and soccer ball are integrated into the quilt as part of the fabric design. These elements appear rounded and naturally aligned within the context of the quilt's fabric, showing no signs of being LEGO tiles. Their appearance is consistent with a textile representation, displaying no deformation but also no characteristics of LEGO tiles, like uniform plastic surface or alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pillow replaced by a cube composed of stacked LEGO bricks with equal dimensions on all sides, right angles, and no visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillow on the bed maintains its fabric characteristics with defined stitching and fabric-like folds. It retains its usual pillow shape, lacking the right angles and uniformity of a cube made up of LEGO bricks. The pillow does not display the plastic material consistency and angular construction typical of a LEGO assembly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bed base a flat, white, seamless surface with no visible wood grain, shadows, or depth cues, resembling a standard LEGO baseplate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed base appears to be a solid white structure with a smooth surface. However, the design still suggests a fabric or real-life surface rather than a LEGO baseplate. There are no cues indicating a LEGO-like uniformity or plastic texture. While the base is smooth, it lacks the characteristics of a LEGO baseplate, which would typically have a more distinct modular block appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire background a smooth, uniform white surface with no visible walls, furniture, or windows, and are there no shadows or lighting gradients indicating a physical space?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is indeed a smooth, uniform white surface devoid of any visible elements like walls, furniture, or windows. There are no noticeable shadows or lighting gradients that would imply a sense of depth or a defined physical space, aligning with the idea of a digitally rendered backdrop or seamless studio setting.",
