    "Question": "Q5: Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent window serves as packaging, providing visibility to the motorcycle model inside. A noteworthy criterion is its clarity—an effective window should exhibit no warping or visual blemishes such as chromatic aberration or ghosting. Upon reviewing the visual clarity through the window, there is no noticeable distortion or coloring issues, ensuring that the motorcycle view remains sharp and undistorted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
