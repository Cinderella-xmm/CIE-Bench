    "Question": "Q1: Do the moss textures on the tusks follow the curvature of the tusks and cast consistent shadows matching the lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tusks appear smooth and curved, and the moss textures follow these curves naturally, suggesting that the moss adheres to the contours of the tusks. The shadows are consistent with the general lighting direction that can be observed in the setting, indicating a realistic interaction between the textures and light. Visual cues such as shadow placement and moss adherence are indicative of these conclusions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the waterfall-like mane flow continuously from the top of the head downward without intersecting or distorting the snout or ear regions?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a mane that flows from the top of the warthog's head downward. It maintains a natural flow and does not intersect or distort the snout or ear regions. The mane's flow appears to be uninterrupted and remains consistent throughout, paralleling realistic hair movement. This conclusion is drawn from observing the direction and behavior of the mane.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the leaf-styled patterns aligned with the natural folds and contours of the warthogâ€™s body, avoiding abrupt edges or misaligned segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf-styled patterns are seamlessly integrated with the natural folds and contours of the warthog's body. They follow the body's shape without creating abrupt edges or misalignment, which suggests a careful design to correspond with the natural anatomy of the animal. Observing the harmonious placement of these patterns leads to this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the fungi positioned along the spine and upper back without overlapping legs or protruding unnaturally into the air?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows fungi positioned along the spine and upper back of the warthog, staying well within the confines of the body's natural outlines. The fungi do not overlap with the legs or protrude awkwardly, maintaining a realistic placement that fits naturally with the creature's design. This can be deduced by assessing the spatial arrangement and positioning accuracy of these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the glowing eyes remain within the eye sockets, preserving the shape of the eyelids and surrounding facial features without distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing eyes are situated within the eye sockets, maintaining the natural shape and alignment of the eyelids and surrounding facial features. The structure of the face does not appear distorted, and the placement of the glowing effect respects the anatomical positioning of the eyes. This is evident from observing the structure of the facial features around the eyes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the branch-shaped hooves connect naturally to the lower legs and maintain consistent joint alignment without breaking the leg structure?",
    "explanation": "The branch-shaped hooves in Image B are clearly connected to the lower legs seamlessly. They preserve the anatomical structure of the leg and maintain consistent joint alignment, evidencing a natural integration without any break in the leg structure. Visual confirmation of the leg's anatomy and joint positioning aids in this assessment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
