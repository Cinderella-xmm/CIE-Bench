    "Question": "Q1: Do the areas previously featuring stitched embroidery (on the shaft and vamp) now display consistent metallic inlay textures with no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boot features metallic inlay textures, replacing the stitched embroidery found in traditional cowboy boots like Image A. The metallic inlay appears smooth and consistent across the boot's surface. There are no visible seams, texture breaks, or mismatched gloss levels evident upon inspection. The use of metallic texture gives the boot a sleek and uniform appearance, with even distribution and cohesive design elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the newly designed stepped heel structurally aligned with the sole and boot shaft, with clean geometric edges and no floating or misaligned segments?",
    "explanation": "Image Bâ€™s boot displays a stepped heel design which is structurally integrated with the rest of the boot, including the sole and shaft. The angles and geometric edges appear clean, and there are no visible misalignments or floating segments. The edges look precisely crafted, showcasing attention to detail and structural soundness.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the transformed patterns along the shaft and toe area composed of sharp, consistent geometric lines without distorting the boot's outline or causing unnatural swelling or compression?",
    "explanation": "The patterns along the shaft and toe area in Image B are composed of bold, sharp geometric lines and shapes, maintaining the boot's natural outline. There is no evidence of distortion, swelling, or compression that disrupts the boot's natural form. The consistent use of geometric design elements enhances the boot's aesthetics without compromising its structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic inlays exhibit uniform specular highlights without bright spots, halos, or uneven reflections that suggest digital noise or over-processing?",
    "explanation": "The metallic inlays in Image B exhibit uniform specular highlights, creating a polished and refined appearance. There are no bright spots, halos, or signs of uneven reflections that might indicate digital noise or over-processing. The reflections are smooth and uniformly distributed, indicative of high-quality image editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the boot maintain a natural foot-shaped profile with properly proportioned toe box, ankle, and shaft height, without unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry?",
    "explanation": "Image B maintains a natural foot-shaped profile with well-proportioned features across the toe box, ankle, and shaft height. There is no visible unnatural elongation, compression, or asymmetry. The design elements and proportions align with typical boot construction, resulting in a visually balanced product overall.",
    "answer": "Yes"
