      "question": "Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are placed in corners that do not overlap with the apples themselves and do not appear to cause any visual interference or artifacts with the scene. The texture of the table and background still appears smooth and natural around these areas, suggesting no additional textures or artifacts have been introduced.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the fonts for \"Fresh\" and \"Sweet\" appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fonts for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are chosen to be simple and bold, ensuring readability against the soft background. The color contrasts well with the image, and the placement doesn't interfere with the focus on the apples, suggesting that the fonts are consistent and not disruptive.",

      "question": "Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are added above and below the apples in Image B, leaving the image of the apples themselves unaffected and undistorted. From a visual perspective, the apples retain their original shape as seen in Image A, suggesting the text addition does not distort the apples.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the alignment of the text \"Fresh\" at the bottom left and \"Sweet\" at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' in Image B is strategically placed in the corners of the image, leaving the central composition of the apples unobstructed. The text does not misalign with any important visual element and maintains a balanced visual structure with respect to the apples, suggesting proper alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the apples, including their speckles and light reflections, remained clear and undamaged after adding the text “Fresh” and “Sweet”?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the addition of text, Image B shows that the apples' surface retains its fine details, such as speckles and light reflections, without any reduction in clarity. This indicates that the addition of text was performed without damaging these intricate details.",
