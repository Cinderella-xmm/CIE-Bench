      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), the brass gears and leather armor appear detailed and well-integrated. The textures look realistic, providing a metallic shine and authentic leather appearance. The elements are properly aligned with no visible gaps or misalignments, indicating careful attention to design and structure. These observations suggest consistency in shape and texture typical of professionally rendered illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clockwork wings present a symmetrical arrangement, with intricate details in gear patterns that suggest a cohesive and logical engineering design. The wings exhibit mechanical joints that appear uniform and intact, without any signs of warping or broken geometry. This reflects a thoughtful and deliberate artistic execution that aligns with principles of engineering realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face in Image B is well-defined within the orb, contributing to a clear and readable appearance. It is properly scaled relative to the orb and emits light harmoniously with the surrounding glow. Neither the shape of the orb nor the textures of the tendrils are compromised or distorted, indicating a successful integration of the elements in keeping with artistic intention.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background cityscape in Image B showcases detailed brass towers and airborne ships, all arranged in a comprehensible and spatially consistent manner. The lighting and shadows are maintained consistently across these elements, complementing the sepia tone, which adds a harmonious vintage effect. There are no floating or disconnected components evident, ensuring the backdrop's logical and cohesive composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia tone in Image B is uniformly applied, enhancing the composition without compromising detail in the character's attire or mechanical components. The tone accentuates features rather than diminishing their visibility. There is no substantial fading, discoloration, or contrast loss in significant parts of the image, ensuring artistic coherence and enhancing the nostalgic aesthetic intended by the artist.",
