    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior appears proportionate, with no visible distortions or unnatural limb proportions. The arms, legs, and torso are well-formed and consistent with an anatomically correct humanoid figure, similar to how such characters are typically represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the armor displays varying shades and highlights, indicating depth and light reflections. The texture of the armor is detailed, providing a sense of realism commonly observed in metallic surfaces, which typically showcase reflections and variability in lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
    "explanation": "The trident in Image B is held firmly in the hand of the Aquatic warrior, with a scale that is proportionate to the figure's size. It appears straight and maintains a suitable length relative to the character, consistent with traditional depictions of similar weapons.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dome displays a consistent curvature and smooth surface. The transparency appears even, without visible distortions or reflections that would suggest stitching or warping, which is typical for well-crafted display cases.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
    "explanation": "The coral reef base in Image B features textures that mimic organic patterns found in natural reefs. The scale is appropriate, providing stable support to the model without overwhelming it or appearing too small, consistent with realistic designs for such dioramas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "The currents depicted in Image B exhibit smooth, continuous lines encircling the model. There are no sudden breaks or isolated fragments, aligning with natural fluid dynamics that typically guide the representation of water movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the model's hand securely grips the trident with five fingers, and the joints are angled naturally, reflecting standard human anatomy. There are no extra digits or unusual bending, which is typical for detailed 3D models representing humanoid figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "All components in Image B appear cohesively arranged. The model, dome, base, and ocean currents are each integrated without visible misalignment or disconnection, typical of effectively rendered display models where spatial coherence is preserved.",
    "answer": "Yes"
