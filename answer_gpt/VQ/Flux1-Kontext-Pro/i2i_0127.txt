    "Question": "Q1: Does the addition of the 'Clean First' slogan in the top left corner maintain the natural appearance and does not introduce any obvious artifacts like blurry edges or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Clean First' slogan is added on a blue background at the top left corner. The slogan integrates well with the surroundings without introducing blurry edges or inconsistent lighting. The color contrast with the tiles is intentional and does not create an appearance of inconsistency. The clear and sharp edges indicate a well-rendered overlay, suggesting a natural addition without noticeable artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Is the 'Comfort Always' slogan added in the bottom right corner visually credible, maintaining structural consistency and not causing any distortion or degradation of the surrounding tiles' texture and details?",
    "explanation": "The 'Comfort Always' text is placed directly on the tile surface at the bottom right corner of Image B. The slogan has clear edges and avoids altering or distorting the tile textures beneath it. The font choice and overlay technique do not obscure or degrade the details of the tile textures, preserving the image's integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the fonts and styles of both slogans blend naturally with the background, avoiding any unnatural textures or interruptions in the tile patterns behind them?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both slogans are superimposed on the image without interrupting the existing tile patterns. The 'Clean First' is on a blue patch, not interacting with the tile, while 'Comfort Always' is directly on the tile surface. Both are sharp and clear, with appropriate font choices that maintain the tile's natural look without creating unnatural texture. Therefore, the fonts and styles manage to blend with the background effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the sizes and placements of the 'Clean First' and 'Comfort Always' slogans create a balanced composition that complements the image without overwhelming the toilet and its setting?",
    "explanation": "The slogans are positioned in their respective corners in Image B, which allows the main subject—the toilet—to remain the central focus of the image. The 'Clean First' slogan at the top left and 'Comfort Always' at the bottom right corner create a diagonal alignment that distributes visual weight evenly across the image. Their sizes are modest, allowing for readability without drawing excessive attention or overwhelming the setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the slogans aligned in a way that respects the geometric shapes of the tiled walls and floor, ensuring the structural and visual coherence of the entire image?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the placement of the slogans shows consideration for the grid pattern created by the tiled walls and floor. 'Clean First' is isolated on a blue background and does not interfere with the tiles, while 'Comfort Always' respects the lines and does not disrupt the visual grid. The alignment of the text echoes the room's geometry, maintaining the structural and visual coherence of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
