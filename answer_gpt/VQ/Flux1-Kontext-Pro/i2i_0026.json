      "question": "Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the line art of Image B, the proportions of the body and movement appear consistent and natural. The limbs are correctly sized relative to the torso, which is crucial for realistic depiction. The progression of poses retains the character's balance and dynamic motion, all matching standard tennis movements. These elements help convey natural action, achieving consistency across all frames.",

      "question": "Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tennis racket and ball are presented in a line art style, which inherently lacks textures and finer details present in real objects. However, the overall depiction is clear with essential features maintained, such as strings on the racket and the round shape of the ball, both necessary for recognition. Despite being stylized, these elements do not introduce any unnatural artifacts, facilitating a coherent representation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image Bâ€™s line art, the hand's position and grip on the racket appear to be accurately rendered. The grip is shown firmly and comfortably, consistent with how one would handle a tennis racket in various positions. This reflects a realistic and ergonomic depiction adhering to typical tennis playing techniques.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the transition to line art in Image B, the absence of background and monochrome coloring emphasizes the character and motion without complexity or distraction. The clarity of the figures is maintained, focusing on essential details of body posture and action sequence. The style ensures readability and avoids distortion or noticeable loss of important detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sequence of actions from preparation to follow-through in the clean line art style visually coherent and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a sequence of actions that follow the logical progression of a tennis play from preparation through follow-through. Each frame represents a momentarily frozen segment of action that, when viewed sequentially, conveys motion clearly and believably. The illustrative logic mirrors the typical sequence in a tennis match, maintaining coherent flow.",
