      "question": "Do the wave patterns along the shoreline consist of smooth, continuous geometric curves without jagged or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns along the shoreline indeed look smooth and are depicted with continuous geometric curves. This artistic representation is typical in stylized illustrations, aiming to maintain an aesthetic simplicity and continuous flow without jagged or broken segments. In contrast to true photographs, such illustrative images often simplify natural features. The comparison with Image A, which might reflect a more photorealistic depiction, suggests that Image B focuses on maintaining a smooth and artistic portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the palm trees along the right side of the beach represented as clean, straight vertical lines without irregular gaps or misplaced branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays palm trees on the right side with clean, stylized lines, and their fronds appear organized and evenly spaced. In artistic depictions like this, the aim is to simplify and stylize natural forms for aesthetic appeal, avoiding the chaotic nature seen in realistic images. Given that Image A might present palm trees with natural imperfections, Image B chooses an artistic representation with straight and regular formations that lack irregular gaps and misplaced branches.",

      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without visible distortion or mismatched edges between adjacent cloud shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds appear to be designed with a certain symmetry and pattern, reflecting an orderly and stylized approach rather than a chaotic, natural cloud formation. There are no visible distortions or mismatches; instead, the clouds follow a methodical arrangement, typical in stylized art where natural forms are idealized rather than depicted in their complex, natural state. This contrasts with Image A, where clouds might be more irregular.",

      "question": "Is the entire scene uniformly rendered in muted greens, blues, and warm oranges, with no areas exhibiting bright or out-of-place colors such as vivid cyan or yellow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays the scene with a palette consisting of muted greens, blues, and warm oranges. These colors are coordinated and harmonize the overall look. The intention behind such color choices in illustrated art often lies in creating a serene and cohesive visual experience, avoiding any conflicts introduced by bright or jarring colors like vivid cyan or yellow. These would be more likely in a diverse photographic palette as potentially seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the rocks on the sandy shore appear proportionally consistent with the surrounding terrain, and are they positioned in a way that aligns with the slope and texture of the beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rocks are depicted with a sense of proportionality that seems consistent with the rest of the terrain. They fit naturally within the stylized depiction, aligning with the slope and texture represented in the simplified beach environment. This artistic consistency is meant to ensure coherence within the illustrative style. Comparing to Image A, a realistic depiction might have variable rock positioning. However, Image B maintains an aesthetic alignment throughout.",
