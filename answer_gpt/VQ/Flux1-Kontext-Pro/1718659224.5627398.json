    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the fortress walls and towers exhibit a uniform golden-brown cookie dough texture with darker edges that match the lighting direction and do not show unnatural pixelation or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress walls and towers display a consistent golden-brown hue commonly associated with a baked or cookie dough-like appearance. The shading and highlights are correctly placed, enhancing the three-dimensional look and contributing to the realistic depiction of texture without any signs of pixelation or shading inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the waterfalls rendered as smooth, continuous streams of royal icing that follow the natural contour of the cliff and show appropriate sheen and thickness without appearing clumped or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B appear to be made from royal icing, which smoothly contours the cliff edges and maintains a consistent flow. The realistic sheen and thickness are evenly applied, providing a seamless appearance that aligns with the contours of the cliffs and does not show any signs of clumping or breakage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the trees formed from green marzipan positioned naturally on the terrain, maintaining plausible size and shape without appearing compressed, misshapen, or disconnected from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B appear crafted from green marzipan, taking on a suitable lollipop or round shape typical of such edible decorations. Their positioning on the terrain seems intentional and realistic, fitting in terms of size and shape while maintaining connection with the ground without any distortion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white ceramic platter clearly visible beneath the cookie fortress, extending outward with clean edges and casting a soft shadow that aligns with the light source, without appearing to float or distort the surrounding terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white ceramic platter in Image B can be observed surrounding the base of the cookie fortress. It has clean, defined edges with a soft shadow cast in alignment with the lighting direction, ensuring it appears naturally placed and not floating or distorting the terrain around it.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, texture discontinuities, or abrupt transitions between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees that suggest poor blending or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a seamless integration between the elements, including the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees. The textures blend well without visible seams or abrupt transitions, suggesting a high level of care in rendering and the absence of blending errors.",
