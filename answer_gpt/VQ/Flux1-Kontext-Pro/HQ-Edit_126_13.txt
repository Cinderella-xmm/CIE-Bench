    "Question": "Q1: Do the annotated lines representing the tea journey follow a smooth, non-intersecting path around the tea set without overlapping or deforming the original objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the annotated lines are drawn to indicate components of the tea journey like 'Tea leaves harvested' and 'Step for boiling water'. These lines are smoothly integrated into the composition and do not overlap with or deform the original objects like the teapot, cup, or vase. The annotations are placed with care, maintaining clarity and respect for the original setup. Hence, the lines are non-intersecting and blend well within the layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the handwritten calligraphy in soft pastel green seamlessly integrated into the scene without causing visual contrast or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The handwritten calligraphy in Image B, such as 'The Journey of Tea', is in a soft pastel green color. It harmonizes well with the overall color palette of the illustration, ensuring a seamless integration. The calligraphy doesn't introduce any high contrast or visual distractions; it fits elegantly within the sketch-like texture of the scene. Consequently, there are no texture artifacts or abrupt contrast issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the minimalist icons for each step of the tea journey proportionally scaled and visually coherent with the surrounding objects and layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, rather than containing graphic icons, the annotations are more textual and graphical interpretations, such as the depiction of pathways and symbols. These illustrative additions are proportionate to the elements they describe and maintain visual coherence with the scene's layout, matching the minimalist and artistic style of the illustration. Hence, they are well-proportioned and appropriately integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the added cherry blossom petals appear to float or fall naturally in the air without unnatural positioning or missing shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom petals are deleted from representation, thus making the question inapplicable for the edited image.",
    "answer": "N/A"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase preserved without visible distortion, blurring, or artificial seams where new elements were added?",
    "explanation": "Image B transforms the scene into a more sketch-like illustration without the photographic realism of Image A. Textures appear intentionally stylized to convey a hand-drawn appearance rather than replicating the exact textures of real materials. This style choice does not imply distortion, blurring, or artificial seams but rather a creative reinterpretation, fitting cohesively within the illustrative theme. Thus, preservation doesn't apply in the traditional sense but supports the artistic transition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
