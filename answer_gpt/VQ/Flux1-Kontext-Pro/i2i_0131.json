      "question": "Do the refrigerator doors and handles appear proportionally correct and geometrically consistent with typical refrigerator designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerator doors and handles are evaluated for proportionality and geometric consistency based on their alignment and dimensions. These doors and handles resemble typical refrigerators, with handles that are long and vertically aligned, fitting the doors' height. The design reflects a common side-by-side refrigerator style, which is familiar in modern kitchens. Proportions are usually standardized to ensure functionality and aesthetics are balanced. Therefore, based on these observations and combining with common kitchen appliance design knowledge, the refrigerator doors and handles appear to be proportionally correct and consistent with typical designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator free from unnatural textures, maintaining a consistent and authentic finish throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of the metallic surfaces in Image B shows a smooth and uniform finish commonly seen in stainless steel appliances. The reflection and sheen are even, which implies a quality finish devoid of artificial textures or distortions. Typical high-quality metallic surfaces display a consistent appearance, barring any manufacturing defects. By assessing the visual cues in Image B, the surfaces do not exhibit any anomalies that depart from an authentic metallic look.",

      "question": "Does the lighting appear uniform across both refrigerators, without noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is analyzed by examining the light distribution and reflection on the refrigerator surfaces. Proper lighting should show even illumination without causing harsh shadows or intense glare, which can disrupt natural appearance. In this image, the lighting appears balanced, as there are no abrupt shadows or highlights visible, ensuring that the refrigerator maintains a uniform and natural look. This is consistent with effective ambient lighting techniques in indoor settings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there smooth transitions where the refrigerators meet the cabinets, without visible seams or edges that break the visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the transitions where the refrigerators meet the surrounding cabinetry is crucial. A seamless integration between the two is visually expected in a well-designed kitchen. The edge lines and joints in Image B are neatly aligned, and no visible gaps or awkward transitions can be seen. This seamless appearance is typical in modern kitchen designs where appliances are intended to 'blend in' with cabinetry. The combination of visual continuity and knowledge of kitchen aesthetics suggests a smooth integration.",

      "question": "Are the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly defined and positioned appropriately, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of the water dispensers involves checking their clarity, definition, and placement in Image B. Each dispenser is clearly rendered, with visible control panels and dispenser nozzles that mirror real-life designs commonly found on refrigerator doors. They are positioned at a height and location that aligns with ergonomic and practical use, contributing to the realism of the scene. Typical refrigerator dispensers are placed for accessibility, confirming their appropriate and realistic portrayal in the image.",
