      "question": "Does the creature's body maintain the structural coherence and visual plausibility of the bubble tea cup's shape and texture without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is designed by combining a bubble tea cup with a creature's body. The cup maintains its original structure as the head, while the body resembles that of a small dinosaur or lizard. This design choice effectively combines the elements of both a beverage and a creature without introducing distortions that deviate from the natural forms of either element. The visual coherence is maintained as the bubble tea cup head integrates smoothly with the body, which aligns with the fantasy theme often seen in animated or illustrated characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the design elements like tapioca pearls and the straw integrated naturally into the creature's form without appearing as unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tapioca pearls remain part of the bubble tea cup, which acts as the creature's head. They are placed in the same area as they would be in a regular bubble tea cup, adding to the believability of the design. The straw is positioned at the top of the cup, which represents the creature's head, making it a natural extension of the cup's structure rather than an ungainly attachment or texture. These design elements are seamlessly integrated into the form of the creature, preserving a natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the custom orb or capsule near the creature's feet feature patterns and colors consistent with the bubble tea theme without losing fine details or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orb or capsule is situated near the creature's feet and exhibits a color scheme and pattern that are in harmony with the main bubble tea theme. The orb's surface is rendered with a texture that complements the overall design, maintaining the cartoony and fantasy aesthetic. The orb is crafted in a way that aligns with the flavor and theme associated with bubble tea, retaining fine details such as color gradients and small decorative elements typical in playful designs.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the creature relative to the custom orb/capsule and the overall scene logically consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is proportioned in a way that suggests a playful and fantasy character. The bubble tea cup forms the creature's head, yet its integration with a dinosaur-like body maintains a whimsical proportion typical of chibi or cartoon-like designs. The orb near its feet is sized appropriately to the small-scale creature, maintaining a logical consistency across the entire scene. The proportions are coherent, supporting the fantasy environment without distortion.",

      "question": "Does the presentation of the creature's name and elemental type complement the artwork's charm without disrupting the visual flow or introducing distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, textual elements such as the creature's name 'Flavor + Sweet + Magic...' are incorporated at the bottom of the illustration. This presentation of descriptive text does not interfere with the main visual elements, maintaining the artwork's charm and cohesiveness. The typography is playful and matches the light-hearted, magical theme, ensuring that it enhances rather than detracts from the viewer's experience of the image.",
