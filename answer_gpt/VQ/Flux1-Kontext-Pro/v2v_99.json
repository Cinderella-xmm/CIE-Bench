      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player appear to blend seamlessly with the realistic soccer field and stadium without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the chibi-style player has exaggerated proportions typical of chibi designs, which contrasts with the realistic environment of the field and stadium. The disparity in style between the chibi player and the realistic setting does result in inconsistencies. The player looks like a separate entity placed onto a realistic backdrop, which does not seamlessly blend together due to the cartoonish nature contrasting with the real-world setting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soccer field, stadium, and cheering crowd still visually plausible and structurally coherent, without any distortions or unnatural textures introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer field, stadium, and crowd appear unchanged from a structural and textural standpoint compared to the original image. The editing that applied the chibi effect seems to have been local to the soccer player, leaving the rest of the background scenery as is, maintaining the overall coherence and realism of those elements.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D soccer player maintain proper proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style transformation adheres to typical chibi proportions, with an oversized head and smaller body but without any visible geometric distortions or broken shapes. Thus, while the proportions are exaggerated by design, they are consistent with chibi norms and not due to any error or distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the chibi-style 3D soccer player look natural and free of any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's chibi-style player features smooth textures and consistency in appearance. There are no visible artifacts or glitches in the rendering of the playerâ€™s uniform or shoes, giving it a clean, albeit cartoonish, appearance. This aligns with typical representations of 3D chibi models.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the action pose of the chibi-style 3D soccer player consistent with the original image, maintaining structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both images depict a similar action pose where the player is performing a kick near the goal. The chibi version in Image B retains this pose accurately, matching the posture and dynamic action seen in the realistic version from Image A. The structural integrity of the pose is maintained, ensuring visual credibility within the stylized chibi context.",
