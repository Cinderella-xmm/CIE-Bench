    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated muscles on the athleteâ€™s arms, shoulders, and abdomen follow natural anatomical contours without introducing unnatural bulges or broken shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the muscles on the athlete's arms, shoulders, and abdomen are depicted with exaggerated emphasis, typical of comic book or graphic novel styles. This style prioritizes dramatic visual impact over anatomical accuracy, often enhancing muscle definition to an extreme degree. The muscles do not follow natural anatomical contours perfectly, as seen in the stylized sharpness and curvature that break the natural lines of the human body, creating an intentionally unrealistic but visually striking image.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the fiery red gloves with gold accents visually consistent in material texture and color, with no visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the gloves with a cartoonish, graphical illustration style that emphasizes bold colors and clean lines. The gloves appear smooth with no intricate details like seams or texture variations as one would expect in realistic depictions. This simplified style is consistent with the overall artistic choice of the image, thus they are visually consistent within this context but do not depict realistic material texture.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the strobe lights in the background evenly distributed and consistent in direction and intensity, without creating unnatural shadows or light leaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is filled with stylized, explosive light effects rather than realistic strobe lights. The emphasis is on creating a dynamic and energetic visual rather than accurate lighting physics. The lights appear to burst outward evenly, providing a symmetrical composition that supports the action-oriented theme without focusing on realistic shadowing or light leaks.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the blank motivational quote panel aligned with the perspective of the scene and does it have consistent lighting and shadowing to appear as if part of the environment?",
    "explanation": "The quote panel in Image B is a flat graphic element placed on top of the scene. Perspective alignment is consistent with the 2D style of the artwork, which itself does not adhere to realistic three-dimensional perspectives. However, the lighting and shadowing are not conforming to realistic standards, as they do not integrate into the scene's dynamic lighting. This inconsistency is typical for comic art where text panels are added as separate elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the composition balanced and framed appropriately so that the central figure and key elements (gloves, stance, lighting) remain clear and undistorted when scaled for print?",
    "explanation": "Image B is designed with strong, bold visual elements typical of comic art, focusing the viewer's attention on the central figure and the key elements like gloves and stance. The composition is symmetrical, with explosive background lights emphasizing the athlete's dynamic pose. This balance ensures that when scaled for print, the key features stand out clearly, maintaining their impact and without distortion due to the simplicity and clarity of the stylistic choices.",
    "answer": "Yes"
