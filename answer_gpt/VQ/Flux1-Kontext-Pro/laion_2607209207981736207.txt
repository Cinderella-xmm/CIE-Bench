    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic texture of the scanner’s body shows subtle highlights and reflections that are consistent with typical light source impacts on metallic surfaces. The highlights are evenly distributed, matching the surface curvature and shape, without any overly shiny or patchy areas that would suggest unrealistic lighting. This indicates a well-rendered metallic texture respecting light physics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scanner’s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic display on the front panel appears to have a layered depth and translucent edges, consistent with how a holographic element would appear in real life. It aligns with the shape of the scanner front, following the contour with precise placement, rather than laying unnaturally flat like a 2D overlay.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows that the grid lines are evenly spaced and parallel to the scanner's orientation. The lines form continuous patterns with smooth edges, indicating good quality rendering without any visible digital artifacts like jaggedness or interruptions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?",
    "explanation": "The tech-themed icons and branding on Image B are clear and well-defined, with appropriate scaling. They are placed neatly on the packaging, away from the main functional areas such as the control panel or paper path, ensuring they do not interfere with critical components.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?",
    "explanation": "Upon comparing Image A and Image B, the overall dimensions and spatial relationships between key components like the paper feed slot and the control panel area are consistent. There is no visible distortion or misalignment. The transformation to packaging design maintains the original scanner’s proportions faithfully.",
    "answer": "Yes"
