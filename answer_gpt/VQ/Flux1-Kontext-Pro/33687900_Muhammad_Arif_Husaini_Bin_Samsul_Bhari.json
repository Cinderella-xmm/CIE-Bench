      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the crystalline hair of the water spirit follow the natural downward trajectory of the original waterfall, maintaining smooth, continuous flow lines that align with the surrounding rock contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the area where the water from the waterfall flows shows that the crystalline hair of the water spirit does not follow a natural trajectory resembling a continued flow. Generally, if a waterfall would transform into such crystalline hair, it should maintain continuous flow lines that align with the surrounding rock contours for coherence, providing a sense of natural movement. Image B shows a flat black background, which suggests the absence of these natural flow lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the luminescent blue hue of the water spirit evenly distributed and softly blended into the surrounding gray and dark rock surfaces without sharp edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background color is uniformly black. An effective luminescent hue would involve soft blending and even distribution, bleeding naturally into surrounding colors and textures, offering a cohesive and visually smooth effect between the spirit and its environment. The absence of visually identifiable hues or blending in the area indicates that this criteria is not met.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine-like appendages have consistent leaf shapes, spacing, and textures that match the surrounding vegetation, and do they grow naturally from the spiritâ€™s body without floating or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Assessing Image B shows no visual presence of vine-like appendages or vegetation on the spirit's body; instead, it appears entirely black. Typically, vine-like appendages should exhibit coherent and consistent design elements and match seamlessly with existing vegetation, ensuring they integrate naturally with the spirit's form. The lack of visible appendages negates consistent leaf shapes, textures, or growth patterns.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing basin reflect light in a way that matches the direction of the falling water and surrounding environment, showing coherent wave patterns and no flat or uniform glow that contradicts natural light behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks any visual elements such as a glowing basin or water reflections, as it displays a uniform black region. In nature, a glowing basin should exhibit reflective qualities consistent with water behavior, like coherent wave patterns influenced by environmental light direction. The absence of these features indicates that proper reflection and matching light behavior are not demonstrated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystalline surfaces of the spirit composed of clear, defined facets with realistic light refraction and shadowing, avoiding pixelation, smudging, or repetitive patterns that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a plain black screen without any discernible crystalline surfaces or defined facets. Typically, crystalline surfaces would feature clear and defined facets with realistic light refraction and shadowing to create a visually striking and artifact-free appearance. The black void does not allow for the assessment of these qualities.",
