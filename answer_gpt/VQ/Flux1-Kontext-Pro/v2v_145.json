      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the mango pieces display a shiny and slightly enlarged effect, but they maintain a natural appearance. The cuts are clear, and the cubed structure is intact, indicating they are not distorted or unnatural. The shine adds visual interest but doesn't compromise the natural texture of the mango.",
