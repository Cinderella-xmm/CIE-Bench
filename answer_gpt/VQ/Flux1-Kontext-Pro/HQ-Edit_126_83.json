      "question": "Is the wooden shadow box frame seamlessly integrated around the image with consistent lighting and realistic wood grain texture, without visible seams or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the wooden shadow box frame is shown as having a consistent lighting effect and a realistic wood grain texture, suggesting an integration that is seamless. The boundaries and edges of the frame appear to be well-integrated with no visible seams or parts that seem to be floating or detached from the overall image. Using world knowledge about frame construction and texture consistency reinforces the perception of a realistic wooden appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the background been updated to a soft pastel tone that harmonizes with the hanbok’s colors and maintains even illumination without unnatural color shifts or banding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background displays a soft pastel tone that visually harmonizes with the colors of the hanbok, contributing to a cohesive aesthetic appearance. The illumination across the background appears to be even, without signs of unnatural color shifts or banding which would disturb the overall flow or context of the image. By leveraging knowledge about the complementary nature of pastel shades and even lighting, the judgment is made.",

      "question": "Are the newly added embroidered floral details on the hanbok consistent in size, style, and texture with the existing patterns, without appearing overdrawn or artificially layered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's hanbok displays embroidered floral details that are consistent in size, style, and texture with those existing on the garment, maintaining a coherent overall design. The embroidery does not appear overdrawn or artificially layered, blending naturally with the fabric of the dress. Referencing world knowledge on textile patterns and traditional hanbok embroidery underscores the image’s fidelity to authentic styling.",

      "question": "Is the fan held naturally in the hand with correct finger placement, no extra fingers, and consistent shading and material texture matching the rest of the hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, there is no fan visible in the hand, indicating the query about whether a fan is held with correct finger placement and shading is not applicable. Thus, common sense logic dictates that when a visual element like a fan is absent from the scenario, any questions about its placement or appearance are typically answered negatively due to irrelevance.",

      "question": "Is the cherry blossom tree positioned behind the figure with appropriate depth, realistic branching, and bloom distribution, without overlapping the body or casting inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom tree is positioned within the wooden box frame behind the figure. It demonstrates appropriate depth placement adding to the three-dimensional space with realistic branching and bloom distribution. There is a clear separation between the tree and the figure, preventing any overlap or shadow inconsistency, reflecting world knowledge about spatial arrangement and natural shadow casting.",
