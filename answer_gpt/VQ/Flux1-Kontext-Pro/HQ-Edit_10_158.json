      "question": "Are the wood grain patterns across the surface of the boot evenly distributed and consistent with natural wood textures, avoiding artificial or repetitive patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns of wood grain on the boot are consistent with natural wood textures, which typically showcase a variety of lines and knots without a repetitive nature. The boot displays wood grain patterns that are colored and aligned in a way that mimics the natural appearance found in wood products, avoiding any repeated or artificial designs. This indicates that the transformation preserves an organic feel in its design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transitions between light and dark wood tones on the boot follow the same contour and depth as the original leather and rubber sections, ensuring no abrupt or unrealistic shifts in color?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood tones transition smoothly over the contours of the boot, maintaining the original shape and depth as seen in leather and rubber footwear. By using differing shades of wood texture that align with the natural curves and seams of the boot, the image avoids abrupt color shifts or unrealistic gradients, preserving the original footwearâ€™s design integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the lacing holes and surrounding reinforcement areas shaped precisely like the original metal hardware and fabric loops, without deformation or missing structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood transformation accurately represents the structural elements present in the original boot design. The lacing holes and reinforcement regions maintain their shape and appear intact, mimicking the hardware and loops seen in a practical boot. This ensures that the alteration from leather to wood does not disrupt the original construction or introduce distortion in these critical areas.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden shelf flat, stable, and properly aligned beneath the boot, with no visible warping, floating, or unsupported edges that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shelf beneath the boot appears flat and well-aligned, offering stable support to the boot without any indication of warping or floating. This ensures the physical logic is preserved, as a shelf typically provides a consistent base without unsupported edges that would compromise its structural integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the boot retain its original three-dimensional shape, including toe box, heel, and ankle support, without any stretching, flattening, or irregular bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the transformation to a wooden material, the boot maintains its original three-dimensional shape, including the toe box, heel, and ankle support, areas crucial for boot functionality. The image retains the volume and contours typical of an outdoor boot, avoiding any deformation or flattening that would diminish its practical design.",
