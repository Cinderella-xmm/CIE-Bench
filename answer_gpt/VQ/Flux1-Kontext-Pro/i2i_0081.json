      "question": "Do the neon lighting effects seamlessly integrate with the mirror reflection, avoiding any artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neon lighting effects are applied uniformly around the mirror. The reflection in the mirror appears consistent with the lighting effects as the colors are appropriately reflected without any noticeable artifacts. In the context of such lighting, reflections need to match the vibrancy and intensity seen directly on the surfaces they're cast upon. Hence, the integration appears well-executed without artifacts or unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the sink area geometry, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B smoothly transitions from one color to another, embracing the contours of the wall and the sink area. The geometry of the sink, cabinet, and wall remains intact, with the gradient complementing the rectangular and vertical lines nicely without altering their defined shapes. Keeping the geometrical integrity means avoiding any jarring transitions that might obscure or distort these shapes, which is maintained here.",

      "question": "Are the materials and textures of the black cabinet visually credible, retaining fine details and avoiding unnatural changes after applying the vaporwave style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black cabinet inserts remain visually credible even after applying the vaporwave style lighting. While the lighting casts new colors on the surfaces, the underlying texture and smooth finish of the cabinet doors do not exhibit unexpected changes or artifacts. Maintaining detail means that the basic physical characteristics, such as smooth finish and minimal fixtures, remain consistent despite the stylistic overlay.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the faucet and soap dispenser area retained their natural appearance without any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts during the vaporwave style conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the faucet and soap dispenser remain discernible and aberration-free despite the vibrant lighting. These elements preserve their structural details, such as the shape and placement, with no signs of distortion or artifacts introduced. This implies that the faucet and dispenser manage to keep their essential design intact, essential for functionality visualization in such imagery.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the placements of neon lighting effects around the mirror and sink area preserve visual plausibility, ensuring physical rationality and absence of distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon lighting effects in Image B are strategically placed to highlight both the mirror's perimeter and the sink area. The lighting curves and lines align with the natural shapes and edges of the objects, with the neon outline effectively emphasizing without distorting these objects. Maintaining physical rationality would mean that lighting should enhance and not contradict the spatial and structural understanding of the scene, which is achieved here.",
