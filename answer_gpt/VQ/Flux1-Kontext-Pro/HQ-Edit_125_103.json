      "question": "Does the transformed teapot maintain a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces and no visible geometric distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a cylindrical tea packaging container rather than a teapot. It maintains a uniform cylindrical shape with smooth, continuous surfaces. There are no visible geometric distortions or irregularities observed on the canister packaging. Thus, the answer is based on the physical appearance of the object being a smooth cylinder.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden foil floral patterns clearly embossed with consistent depth, proper lighting interaction, and no signs of blurred edges or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's an absence of noticeable golden foil floral patterns. Any decorative elements are subtle and don't carry the attributes of embossed patterns with depth or lighting interaction typical of foil. Thus, the question is likely not applicable to the details observed in Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the redesigned cups stacked in a stable, physically plausible manner with matching rim sizes and lids that fit securely without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows multiple cups stacked one inside another. The stacking appears stable and the rims of each cup seem to match each other size-wise. There are no visible lids involved with the cups, only the cylindrical container lid. Thus, the stacking and physical configuration seem appropriate.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the Japanese calligraphy positioned at the top of the packaging with natural brushstroke variation and clear legibility, without clipping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Japanese calligraphy in Image B is visible on the cylindrical container. It is positioned on the side of the canister, not the top. However, it appears with clear legibility and natural brushstroke variation, without any clipping or distortion. Although the position is not on the top, the quality and presentation are not compromised.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the bamboo motif along the side have consistent node spacing, natural grain texture, and smooth edges without repeating or distorted segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a bamboo motif along the side of the cylinder. The node spacing appears consistent and the motif does display a natural grain texture, with smooth edges observed in the depiction. There are no apparent repeating or distorted segments. The design provides a naturalistic representation of bamboo.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the surface beneath the tea set completely flat, uniformly white, and free from any unintended shadows, textures, or reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface beneath the tea set segment is indeed flat and uniformly white. There are minimal shadows present, mainly natural ones directly related to the objects placed on it, without any unintended textures or overwhelming reflections.",
