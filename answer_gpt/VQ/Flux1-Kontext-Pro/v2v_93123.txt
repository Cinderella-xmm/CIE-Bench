    "Question": "Q1: Does the lighting on the man and the pineapple appear consistent with the new aged blackboard background, without introducing unnatural shadows or highlights?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the lighting in Image B, the light source appears warm and diffused, similar to the ambiance in old settings. The pineapple and the man's clothing are illuminated from the left side, casting subtle, natural shadows on the right, aligning well with the generally ambient lighting expected from an aged indoor environment, like that of a classroom. The aged blackboard behind them creates a consistent feel of lighting throughout the image, preventing any unnatural disparities in shadows or highlights across the subjects and the background.",
