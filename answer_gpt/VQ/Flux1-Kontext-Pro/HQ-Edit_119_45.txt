    "Question": "Q1: Are the brass and copper textures on the headdress and face uniformly smooth and reflective, without visible noise, patchy areas, or abrupt transitions between adjacent segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brass and copper textures are likely to exhibit enhanced surface characteristics. By assessing the surface reflectivity and texture for any inconsistencies or abrupt transitions, one can conclude the quality of the texture. In this case, they appear smooth and reflective across the visible sections, without notable visual noise or abrupt transitions between segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the vertical and horizontal stripes of the nemes headdress retain their original alignment and spacing, with no bending, stretching, or misalignment caused by the addition of mechanical parts?",
    "explanation": "To assess this, one must look at the continuity of the stripes. In Image B, the stripes appear to maintain their original alignment and spacing without any visible distortion or misalignment despite the addition of other mechanical elements in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the mechanical wings symmetrically placed on either side of the head or shoulders, with clean edges, defined joints, and emerald accents that do not appear floating or disconnected from the structure?",
    "explanation": "Image B seems to suggest that there are no distinct mechanical wings associated with the design in the areas immediately around the head or shoulders, as none are visible in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the clockwork designs on the collar clearly defined and evenly spaced, with steam exhaust pipes attached at plausible locations and angles, and no overlapping or clipping with surrounding elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the collar shows clockwork designs with careful attention to detail. The spacing of these elements appears deliberate, with steam exhaust pipes integrated at reasonable positions without overlapping or clipping into other elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the vapor emerging from the steam exhaust pipes translucent and softly diffused, with no sharp edges, pixelation, or unnatural clustering that suggests digital artifacting?",
    "explanation": "The vapor in Image B needs to be assessed for its qualities of translucency and diffusion. If the vapor appears softly diffused around the edges and transparent with no indication of sharp pixelation or artificial clustering, this suggests quality rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the eyes, nose, and mouth proportionally aligned and anatomically correct, with no warping, elongation, or asymmetry caused by the integration of gears or other mechanical elements?",
    "explanation": "The question is not applicable to the blurred sections as the crucial features are not assessable due to the blurring effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
