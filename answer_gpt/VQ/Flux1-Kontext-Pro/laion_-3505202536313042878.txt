    "Question": "Q1: Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man's limbs and torso are stylized but still appear to follow natural human anatomical proportions and joint articulation. The arms and legs maintain a consistent size relative to the torso, and the joints like elbows and knees are where they would naturally occur on a body. This reflects the artist's intent to keep a level of realism in the stylized depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tuxedo has visible textures and shading that give it depth and make it appear as a real fabric, despite the stylized nature. The fur jacket also shows texture consistent with what you would expect from fur, with appropriate highlights and shadows to suggest depth.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a simplified design for the setting, which includes a pattern in the background. However, the FIA logo and sponsor names are not clearly visible or distinct due to the stylized nature and pattern design overriding this visibility.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold ribbon-like border appears to be closed, well-shaped, and maintains a consistent thickness around the entire perimeter of the rectangular area, suggesting deliberate design and careful execution to maintain uniformity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
    "explanation": "The embossed logo in Image B is visible, with variation in depth and shadowing that makes it appear textured and realistic on the surface of the envelope. It does not appear flat or artificially rendered, showing the intended embossed effect effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
    "explanation": "The stamp in Image B appears well-integrated into the envelope with shadowing that complements the raised appearance of the stamp, and the perspective aligns with the envelope's surface, effectively making it look physically attached.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, upon examining the stylized depiction, both individuals appear to have five fingers on each hand, with the hands shaped naturally, adhering to typical human anatomy without showing any deformation or missing digits.",
    "answer": "Yes"
