      "question": "Does the outdoor camping scene seamlessly integrate with the toasters, maintaining consistent lighting and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the toasters matches the sunlight that would be expected in an outdoor environment. The shadows fall at consistent angles, suggesting that the integration of the toasters into the outdoor scene maintains lighting consistency. Common sense tells us that this consistent alignment of lighting and shadows aids in making the scene look seamless.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the toasters placed naturally on the folding table without any visible distortion in the table's texture or structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasters appear securely placed on the table without any visible signs of distortion or discontinuity in the tableâ€™s texture and surface structure. World knowledge suggests that a stable and natural placement would not show any discrepancies at the points of contact.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sunlight effects on the toast create realistic highlights and shadows on both the toast and surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the toasts exhibit highlights and shadows that align with the direction and intensity of the sunlight illuminating the scene. The shadows extend in the direction opposite the light source, indicating a realistic depiction of how light interacts with objects like toast in such lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the outdoor camping background and the foreground elements smooth, without any noticeable artifacts or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the indoor elements (toasters and table) to the outdoor camping background appears smooth. The grass, trees, and overall environment do not exhibit noticeable artifacts or abrupt changes that could disrupt the cohesion between the foreground and background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the proportions and shapes of the toasters remained intact and physically plausible in the new outdoor camping scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sizes and shapes of the toasters have been preserved. They look proportionate to each other and to the table, which is necessary for a physically plausible scene. This is consistent with world knowledge of how objects maintain their dimensions when transposed between environments.",
