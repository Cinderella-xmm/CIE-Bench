    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the character’s eyes in Panel 1 clearly narrowed and intense, with visible tension in the eyelids and pupils, and is the hand gripping the katana properly aligned with five distinct fingers showing natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1, the character's eyes do appear narrow and intense, indicating a focus or determined expression. The eyelids are drawn to create tension, which is common in anime to convey intensity. However, the character does not have visible fingers gripping the katana in Panel 1. Instead, the focus is on the facial expression rather than the hand or fingers. Thus, if the hand alignment is part of the consideration, it is not portrayed in this panel.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the character’s leaping pose in Panel 2 show correct leg extension and arm positioning consistent with forward momentum, and do the fiery trails originate naturally from the hair strands without overlapping into solid parts of the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the character is depicted in a dynamic pose that implies forward momentum. The leg appears properly extended, and the arms are positioned to suggest a leaping motion. The fiery trails emanate from the hair and appear well-aligned with the movement without obvious overlap into areas like the solid parts of the body, preserving the dynamic energy of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the katana in Panel 3 correctly oriented forward without clipping through the character’s uniform or distorting the sleeve, and are the surrounding energy swirls continuous and free of pixelated or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, the katana is depicted as extending forward, but it is difficult to determine its orientation relative to the character's uniform without clipping. The panel’s energy swirls seem continuous and fluid, without visible pixelation or breaks in the lines, which are common challenges in digital editing or creation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the backgrounds in all three panels retain their original vibrancy and contrast without color bleed into the character’s outline or loss of sharpness in the bold borders around her figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backgrounds in Image B for all three panels are colorful and vibrant, showing a range of colors that support the theme of energy and action. There is no noticeable color bleed into the character's outline, maintaining separation between the background and the figure. The bold borders around the character remain sharp, helping the main subject stand out against the vibrant background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the character’s head, torso, and limbs proportionally consistent across all three panels, with no stretching or compression that alters the original anatomy or causes misalignment between body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Across the three panels in Image B, the character's proportions appear consistent. The head, torso, and limbs maintain a coherent ratio to one another, which is crucial in maintaining character consistency across different frames or images. No stretching or compression is evident that would otherwise distort her anatomy or cause misalignment.",
