      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the scarecrowâ€™s body exhibit a consistent glossy finish across all areas where straw was replaced, without visible seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow is depicted on the box rather than as a physical object, indicating the design on the packaging. The texture of the scarecrow on the box doesn't appear glossy or exhibit any seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches, as it is a printed image on the packaging rather than a physical one where such issues would be more apparent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hat structurally intact and proportionally consistent with the original, featuring a clearly defined opening at the top that allows for candle placement without distorting its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat on the scarecrow depicted on the packaging in Image B does not have an opening for candle placement. Instead, the candle is built into a separate compartment of the box next to the image of the scarecrow. The question about the hat's structure in this context does not apply as there's no modification to the hat itself for candle placement.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the LED string lights positioned along the scarecrow or packaging in a way that emits soft, localized light without causing unnatural bright spots, flickering effects, or visible wiring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LED string lights are shown positioned in front of the box. The lights emit a soft glow without any unnatural bright spots. The wiring is visible, but it seems to be part of the design, blending well against the background, which minimizes its presence. The question implies evaluating if the lights look adequately integrated and not disruptive.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the crow figurine resting stably on the top edge of the box, aligned with gravitational logic, and matching the size and proportions of the birds seen in flight in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crow figurine is placed on top of the box. It appears stable and proportionally larger compared to the birds in the background image on the box, but this difference is sensible as the figurine is meant to be physically present rather than part of the distant image. The alignment with gravitational logic seems appropriate for a decorative figurine.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the packaging surrounding the scarecrow have clean edges, consistent material shading, and proper shadow alignment with the light source, indicating a solid, three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the packaging with clean edges, and the shading on the box appears consistent with the light source, which is likely the small candle and ambient lighting in the scene. The shadows align with these light sources, reinforcing the appearance of a three-dimensional and solid box structure.",
