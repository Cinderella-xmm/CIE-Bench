      "question": "Are the textures and details of the horse and people preserved naturally without any unnatural artifacts after the monochrome conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monochrome conversion has maintained a detailed texture and features of the horse and people. The shading on the horse's body is well-defined, capturing its muscle contours similar to an artistic dot work or etching style, which is commonly seen in monochrome illustrations or posters. This style inherently results in a textured, stippled appearance without artifacts that detract from the natural depiction. Hence, the textures are preserved well without unnatural artifacts.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and shapes of the horse and people look realistic and undistorted in the monochrome rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the horse and people remain realistic. The horse's body, legs and head are accurately depicted, along with the people's positions and clothing details. The stippling artistic style does not distort proportions or shapes, maintaining a coherent and realistic portrayal of forms, much like traditional illustration techniques that emphasize accuracy in silhouette.",

      "question": "Do the background elements such as trees and the trailer retain their natural appearance and details without any loss or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as the trees and trailer have been converted into a monochrome stippling style, which inherently alters the texture but retains the shapes and general aspects naturally. The trailer maintains its structure and elements like windows and door, while the trees have enough detail to be recognized as such without appearing distorted or losing essential features. The monochrome style is consistent throughout, ensuring no loss of detail.",

      "question": "Does the interaction between the people and the horse appear natural and coherent without any visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interaction between the people and the horse is depicted in a manner that appears natural and coherent. The positions and gestures are unchanged and accurately show the act of guiding the horse into the trailer. The monochrome style has not introduced any visual inconsistencies, maintaining the realistic representation of human-animal interaction that is visually understandable and logical.",

      "question": "Does the rustic typography used for event details blend naturally with the image without disrupting its overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rustic typography used for event details complements the monochrome and stippling style of the poster, blending with it rather than disrupting the visual flow. The typographyâ€™s style is consistent with vintage or rustic design aesthetics common in event posters, where text is seamlessly integrated without overshadowing the imagery. Thus, it harmonizes well with the overall appearance, maintaining the poster's credibility and unified look.",
