      "question": "Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the extended stripes from the zebra do not seamlessly blend into the grass and instead create a highly unnatural pattern. Normally, grass has random, organic patterns, but here, the stripes form a repetitive, linear pattern across the grass, which is not characteristic of natural grass textures. This pattern clearly indicates an artificial modification because natural grass would not have such uniformity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original geometric structure of a zebra's stripes follows the curvature and contours of its body, aiding in camouflage and defining its body shape. In Image B, the stripes are extended in straight, parallel lines into the grass, which does not maintain the organic curvature and flow of the zebra's naturally occurring stripes. This alteration breaks away from the natural proportions and structure, presenting a geometrically altered pattern that doesn't adhere to the reality of a zebra's body.",

      "question": "Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stripes continue into the grass, creating a grid-like pattern which significantly draws the viewer's attention away from the zebra itself. The zebra's stripes are supposed to enhance its form, not detract from it. The extension creates a secondary, possibly more dominant visual element that competes with the zebra, taking away from its prominence and making the composition less credible and balanced.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the extension of the zebra's stripes, the key features such as its mane, ears, and legs remain clearly visible. These features maintain their natural appearance and are not altered by the stripe extension into the grass. The editing focused on extending the stripes beyond the zebra into the environment, but did not interfere with the internal structure of the zebra's body and its defining features.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the original zebra stripes maintain some of their sharpness and detail, the grass part does not retain natural details as it adopts an artificial stripe pattern. The repetition in the grass introduces a significant alteration, disrupting the organic texture. Such a modification can be considered an introduction of artificial elements rather than preserving natural detail and fine texture. The distinction between the original zebra stripes and the new, artificial grass stripe pattern is evident, indicating noticeable alterations.",
