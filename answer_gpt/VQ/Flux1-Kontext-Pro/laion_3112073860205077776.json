      "question": "Are the illustrated blueberries and text labels seamlessly integrated into the pie surface without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blueberries are illustrated on a diagram with a cartoon aesthetic rather than applied directly to the pie surface. The labels and graphics are part of an illustrative representation rather than the food items themselves. Therefore, issues like pixelation or jagged edges typically associated with poor photographic editing are not relevant here as these elements are illustrations. The seamless integration can be evaluated based on the cohesive style and execution of the illustration itself.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the anthropomorphic version of the mug retain the original cylindrical shape and handle position without stretching, warping, or breaking the object's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mug is illustrated in a cartoon style, featuring a face and pastel tones. The mug retains a cylindrical shape common to mugs, and the handle is drawn in the standard position of a mug handle, reflecting the form it is supposed to emulate. Hence, the anthropomorphic depiction does maintain the object's original shape without any visible distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the chart positioned clearly within the frame without overlapping or obscuring the pie slice, mug, or plate, and does it have clean lines and legible text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chart featuring different labels and health tips is distinctly positioned in the lower half of the image. It does not overlap or obscure the pie slice, mug, or plate which are clearly visible in the upper portion of the image. The lines within the chart are clean, and despite being stylized, text remains legible for its intended audience.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the warm pastel tones applied evenly across the scene without causing unnatural discoloration of the ceramic, glass, or baked pie surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B transitions to a stylized illustration utilizing warm pastel tones. The pie slice, mug, plate, and other elements are reimagined with these tones, enhancing the visual cohesion without causing any unnatural discoloration since this is a shift to a uniform illustrative palette rather than photographic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the pie slice, mug, plate, and table maintain their original geometric forms and spatial relationships without any visible warping, fragmentation, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, components like the pie slice, mug, and plate are translated into a cartoon style while maintaining their elemental forms. Their spatial relationships are consistent with typical placement in a breakfast setting, despite the illustration's stylized nature. There is no evidence of warping or misalignment impacting their geometric forms as originally intended.",
