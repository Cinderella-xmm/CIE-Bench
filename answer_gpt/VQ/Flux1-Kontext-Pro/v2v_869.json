        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure in Image B is designed with a stylized proportion consistent with characteristics of chibi art, such as a larger head compared to the body, short limbs, and rounded features. This is a common artistic style and does not signify distortion if it maintains consistency and completeness. The figure does not show any broken or irregular geometric shapes; its overall structure appears coherent.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures and materials represented on the chibi-style figure in Image B appear smooth and consistent, reflecting typical artistic interpretations of clothing on stylized figures.

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the large, sparkling eyes and cheerful smile of the chibi-style figure look natural and consistent with its overall design without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face of the figure is blurred in this case, the focus is instead on assessing the potential design elements associated with chibi figures. Generally, chibi figures have expressive features, often exaggerated to enhance charm. Although facial features like sparkling eyes and smiles are characteristic of such art, in this presented case, these details aren't visible to assess.",

      ],
