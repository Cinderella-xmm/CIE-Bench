      "question": "Is the cylindrical body of the tea canister proportionally consistent with the original teapot’s scale and maintains continuous, undistorted dragon engravings along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the tea canister does display dragon engravings along its surface. These engravings appear continuous and are proportionally adjusted to fit the cylindrical shape of the canister. The engravings do not appear distorted, suggesting careful adaptation of the design to the new shape. In Image A, the dragon engravings are on the rounded teapot. When comparing both images, the engravings have been adapted successfully to fit the cylindrical canister without noticeable distortion or disproportionate scaling.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the screw cap appear seamlessly integrated with the canister body, with no visible seams or mismatched textures, and does it exhibit consistent metallic sheen and fine leaf embossing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the screw cap of the tea canister looks smoothly integrated with the canister body, exhibiting a consistent metallic sheen throughout. The transition between the cap and body shows no visible seams or texture mismatches. The leaf embossing on the cap is detailed, with consistent texture and metallic finish that matches the canister. World knowledge about quality metal fabrication aligns with these observations, leading to the conclusion of a seamless design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Dragon's Delight\" aligned smoothly along the spout’s curve, with legible, evenly spaced characters that do not distort the underlying metal texture or cause unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Dragon's Delight' in Image B is positioned on the cylindrical part of the canister rather than along a spout's curve. The text is aligned smoothly orthogonally across the cylindrical surface. The letters are legible and evenly spaced without causing distortion of the underlying metal or its texture. There is no evidence of unnatural shading affecting the text's visibility. This careful placement and consistent integration suggest adherence to high-quality design standards.",

      "question": "Is the tea leaf logo centered on the cap’s top, rendered with clean lines and uniform depth, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there is no discernible tea leaf logo on the cap’s top. Instead, the cap features an ornate design similar to a finial. As there is no logo present, the question of jagged edges, inconsistent lighting, or clean lines regarding a tea leaf logo does not apply. Therefore, the claim does not hold true based on the visual provided.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the dragon engravings fully intact and evenly distributed across the cylindrical body, with no gaps, repetition, or warping that would suggest deformation during the shape conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon engravings on the canister in Image B appear to be carefully adapted to suit the cylindrical form. They are evenly distributed, maintaining the integrity and aesthetic of the original design seen in Image A, where the symmetrical engravings are clear on the teapot. There is no visible indication of gaps, warping, or unnecessary repetition in the engravings, implying that the design was meticulously transformed without deformation.",
