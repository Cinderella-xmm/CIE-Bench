      "question": "Does the African savanna at night blend seamlessly with the existing train and tracks, without any unnatural edges or contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a train against an African savanna at night with starry skies in the background. The transition of the train onto the tracks set in the savanna appears smooth, with the lighting and colors seamlessly integrated into the new setting. There are no visible harsh lines or clear mismatches in the collage, suggesting a well-done blending process.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stars and the Milky Way depicted naturally, without any artificial or pixelated textures disrupting their appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stars and Milky Way in the edited image appear clear and vibrant, closely resembling how they might naturally appear without signs of pixelation or artificiality. The sky looks smooth, and the textures do not show any obvious digital errors, suggesting a high-quality rendering of the night sky.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks correspond logically to the new nighttime savanna setting, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the train and tracks are shown under a night sky with starlight. The lighting on the train is subdued and matches a nighttime environment. Shadows are consistent with this setting, adding depth without contradicting the ambient light source.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the size of the train relative to the vastness of the African savanna and the starry sky proportionally correct and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image places a train against a vast savanna and an expansive starry sky. The train is proportional considering typical dimensions and perspective, fitting realistically within the landscape's scale. The proportions are reasonable, neither too small to the scenery nor overly large, which ensures believable spatial placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the train been preserved without degradation or introduction of unnatural textures during the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An analysis of the edited image reveals that the train's details, such as its paint and structure, appear crisp and clear. There are no noticeable distortions or unexpected textures introduced by the editing process, indicating that the detail quality has been maintained throughout.",
