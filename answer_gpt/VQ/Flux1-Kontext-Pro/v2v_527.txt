    "Question": "Q1: Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is represented in a LEGO style, characterized by its blocky and structured appearance typical of LEGO designs. This kind of representation allows for simplified and stylized forms that are consistent with the LEGO aesthetic, presumed to be intentional. The dog's body shape, positioning on the stop sign, and overall form align with this style, showing no signs of visual distortion or structural inconsistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The stop sign in Image B is designed to look like a LEGO piece, which means it retains a simplified, geometric structure. The proportions of the octagonal shape, as well as the lettering, seem consistent and appropriate for a LEGO-style piece, without any distortion or breakage in its geometric form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
