      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the wooden puzzle pieces covering the castle's exterior uniformly textured with natural oak and mahogany variations, showing no repeating patterns or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the castle is constructed from wooden blocks with a consistent grain and color characteristic of a single type of wood, possibly oak, given its lighter shade. There are visible seams at the intersections typical of wood construction but no evidence of material variation such as different shades that would be present if multiple wood types were used. Repeating patterns or artificial seams are not evident, as the wood grain flows naturally without disruption. Thus, the texture appears uniform.",

      "question": "Do the towers, archway, and surrounding walls retain their original shape and proportions without any geometric distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structural elements such as towers, archway, and walls retain clear and straight lines, maintaining their geometric integrity. The structure shows well-aligned edges and consistent proportions without any visible bending, distortion, or misalignment. This analysis involves observing the perpendicularity and parallelism of the castle's features, all of which appear intact and undisturbed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the top edges of both towers composed of clearly interlocked wooden puzzle pieces with no gaps, floating fragments, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top edges of the towers in Image B exhibit a consistent interlocking pattern typical of puzzle or construction blocks, with no evident gaps or breaks. The wooden segments appear to connect seamlessly with each other, reflecting precision in assembly. This observation is based on analyzing the joints where the wooden pieces meet, which are clean and crisp without any visible flaws.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the castle resting on a smooth, continuous wooden surface that matches the wood type and finish of the puzzle pieces, with consistent lighting and shadow under the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the castle in Image B is a flat wooden surface that visually matches the wood type and finish of the castle blocks. The lighting is uniform, casting consistent shadows that accurately reflect the position of individual blocks relative to the surface, indicating no irregularities in surface finish or texture. This involves noting the reflection and shadow consistency between the castle and the tabletop.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the reflections in the water and shadows beneath the castle show accurate interaction with the wooden surface, with no unnatural glare, color shifts, or floating reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain elements such as reflections in water or shadows on varied surfaces as seen in Image A. The castle sits directly on a wooden tabletop without any water body interaction. Given there is no water surface in Image B, the question of reflections in water and associated lighting phenomena such as unnatural glare or floating reflections is not applicable.",
