      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the branches of the tree composed of clean, angular geometric lines consistent with Art Deco style, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree branches maintain a natural curvature with a smooth rounded appearance that fits within the stained glass motif, rather than clean, angular lines typical of Art Deco style. While the tree is stylized, it does not fully embrace the angular geometric approach seen in Art Deco design. The branches are consistent with the fluidity found in the stained glass depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass in the foreground display muted, uniform coloration with preserved textural details such as individual blades or soft gradients, rather than appearing uniformly flat or artificially colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass in the foreground has a soft gradient, maintaining textured variance and providing depth. It differs from a flat surface as it displays textural nuances that resemble natural grass. This approach suits the stained glass aesthetic, enhancing the scene with preserved details rather than appearing artificial.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mountain silhouettes composed of defined angular planes in bronze and teal tones, maintaining layered depth and spatial consistency without overlapping or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountain silhouettes in Image B are rendered with clear angular outlines that effectively delineate planes and create depth. The use of colors like bronze and teal helps in emphasizing the separation between these planes, maintaining spatial consistency. The design is coherent and each section of the mountains is layered properly, retaining the solidity typical of such stylized art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sky feature a smooth gradient from dark at the top to lighter near the horizon, with thin, evenly spaced accent lines that follow the curvature of the scene without intersecting or distorting the starfield?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B displays a smooth gradient from darker tones at the top to lighter tones nearing the horizon, consistent with the stained glass design aesthetic. The accent lines, resembling rays emanating from the sun behind the tree, are evenly spaced and bolster the scene curvature without negatively impacting the starfield, keeping it consistent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—tree, mountains, and sky—rendered with consistent stained glass-style outlines and fills, lacking transparent patches, misaligned edges, or inconsistent shading within the same layer?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays elements like the tree, mountains, and sky rendered with stained glass-style outlines and consistent fills. The design employs strong black outlines characteristic of stained glass art. Additionally, shading within each layer is consistently applied with no visible transparency, misalignment, or inconsistent shading, contributing to the cohesion and uniformity of the scene.",
