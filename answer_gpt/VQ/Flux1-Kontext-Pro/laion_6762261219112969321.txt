    "Question": "Q1: Do the cloud textures on the seat, backrest, and armrests appear soft, layered, and continuous without flat or blocky regions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa has been edited to appear as if it is covered in fluffy, cloud-like textures. The visual cues such as the subtle gradations in shading and the general rounded, puffy appearance suggest a soft, layered, and continuous quality. These elements contribute to the impression of cloud textures, indicating they are neither flat nor blocky.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Are the wooden frame and legs replaced with branching, flowing wind-like structures that follow natural fluid motion without sharp angles or rigid breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden frame and legs from Image A remain unchanged and are still visible as distinct solid wooden components. They have not been replaced with any wind-like structures. The frame maintains its structured, angular appearance with no flowing or fluid characteristics.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes positioned on the upper cushions with smooth integration into the cloud texture, lacking jagged edges or unnatural color contrasts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are added to the upper cushions of the sofa. They have a smooth, rounded shape that seamlessly integrates into the fluffy cloud-like texture surrounding them. There are no jagged edges or color contrasts that seem unnatural; instead, the eyes appear naturally embedded in the texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the mist trail extend continuously from the back of the sofa with consistent texture and fading intensity, without sudden breaks or unnatural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, a faint mist trail is depicted extending from the back of the sofa. The texture of the mist appears soft with a gradual fading effect as it moves away from the sofa, lacking any abrupt breaks or unnatural boundaries. This suggests a seamless continuity in its appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the overall structure of the sofa preserved with proper alignment between the seat, backrest, arms, and base, without visible gaps, overlaps, or geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, despite the added cloud-like textures and eyes, the fundamental structure of the sofa is preserved. The seat, backrest, armrests, and wooden base maintain their alignments and proportions as in Image A. There are no visible gaps, overlaps, or distortions in the structure, ensuring the furniture retains its intended geometric integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
