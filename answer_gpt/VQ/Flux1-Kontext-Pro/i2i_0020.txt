    "Question": "Q1: Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train retains its geometrical shape, with clean lines and a clear form, consistent with a minimalist style. The STOP sign is also well-defined with sharp edges and clear text. There's no evidence of distortion or broken shapes, which aligns with the expectation for geometric simplification in a minimalist rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are represented by simple, smooth green shapes that complement the minimalist style. The track lines are clear and straight, contributing to the simplicity of the design. Both elements are consistently integrated with the overall cool-toned, minimalist aesthetic, maintaining visual harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the textures of the train and STOP sign have been simplified, yet their essential forms and functions are maintained. The train has clear, distinct sections, and the STOP sign has legible text and recognizable shape. The absence of unnecessary detail keeps the focus on form over texture without resulting in an unnatural appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spatial relationships between the train, STOP sign, and tracks are preserved in a minimalist style. The relative positions are consistent with an actual railway setting, reflecting the correct perspective and alignment, thus maintaining visual credibility despite the simplified representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a cool-toned palette with shades of gray and muted greens, maintaining consistency across the illustration. This palette harmonizes with the minimalist post-processing and emphasizes the safety-oriented visuals, such as the prominent red on the STOP sign, ensuring effectiveness in communicating traffic safety.",
    "answer": "Yes"
