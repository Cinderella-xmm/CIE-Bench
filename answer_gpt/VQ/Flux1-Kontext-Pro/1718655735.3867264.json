      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the fairy have consistent transparency, smooth surface curvature, and realistic reflections without visible artifacts such as jagged edges or unnatural refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome displays a clear and consistent transparency complemented by realistic reflections. Its surface curvature appears smooth without any noticeable jagged edges or distortions in the reflections. My analysis was based on typical properties of glass, which usually exhibits smooth and rounded surfaces that capture light reflections in a particular manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wooden base beneath the fairy rendered with realistic wood grain patterns, consistent shading, and no artificial or distorted surface features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base shows what appears to be authentic wood grain patterns with consistent shading, contributing to a realistic and natural appearance. There are no signs of artificial features like uneven surfaces or distortions. My conclusion is drawn from the observed detailed wood texture and typical appearance of real wood bases.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the butterfly wings' metallic surfaces evenly lit with subtle highlights and reflections, maintaining intact venation patterns and no visible texture repetition or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings exhibit an even lighting with subtle highlights, and any potential venation patterns appear to be evenly lit without obvious repetition or texture distortion. My analysis is based on the visual cues showing consistency in texture and highlights typical of metallic surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the fabric textures on the fairyâ€™s outfit appear detailed and continuous, with no abrupt transitions, blurring, or inconsistencies in thread patterns or material thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fabric on the fairy's outfit seems to possess detailed textures with continuous threads. The material does not show any abrupt transitions or inconsistencies that would affect its realistic look. Analyzing this, the fabric appeared consistent with known qualities of well-rendered textiles, which maintain even thread patterns and material thickness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the floating petals and leaves positioned at varying depths with soft edges and translucent qualities, showing no overlapping errors, sharpness mismatches, or unnatural placement relative to the fairy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays floating petals and leaves at various depths, with some showcasing soft edges and translucent qualities. They appear naturally positioned without notable overlapping errors or sharpness disparities. The reasoning stems from the visual depth and softness observed, typical of floating elements in space relative to a central figure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the blue gradient background smoothly transitioned without visible color bands, pixelation, or irregularities in tone distribution?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue gradient background transitions smoothly without any noticeable color bands or pixelation. The tone distribution seems even, showing no irregularities. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent gradient typical of high-quality rendering, which should occur without visible transitions or defects.",
