      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements (birds and branch) and the new background (starry night sky and moon) appear seamless without any unnatural artifacts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the birds, the branch they sit on, and the new background needs to be assessed for any visual discrepancies. The birds and the branch must integrate naturally with the starry sky and moonlit environment without any jarring edges or mismatched lighting. Upon a careful look, Image B shows a seamless transition from the birds and branch to the new night background, with no visible artifacts or breaks that would make the edited elements appear unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors and lighting of the starry night sky consistent with the rest of the image, and do they not introduce any unnatural artifacts or conflicting light sources?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The starry night sky in Image B should match the overall tone and lighting of the scene. The colors of the sky should blend harmoniously with the elements in the foreground, including the birds and leaves, without creating conflicting light sources or startling contrasts. The moon acts as a light source, illuminating parts of the scene, and its integration should add to the consistency. Upon examining, the lighting and color scheme of Image B appear cohesive, with the night sky naturally enhancing the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the placement and appearance of the new moon natural within the context of the night sky, and does it not appear out of place or overly bright compared to the stars?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon and stars need to align naturally, where the moon should have a brightness that fits the starry sky without drawing undesired attention or creating an unrealistic gleam that dominates the night scene. A well-placed and proportionately bright moon will create a balanced nightscape. In this image, the moon is integrated in such a manner that it does contribute to the scene without overshadowing or clashing with the starry night.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the birds retain their detailed features, texture, and proportions after the background change, showing no signs of distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Regardless of the backdrop, the birds in Image B should maintain their natural features, textures, and proportions. They should not appear distorted, blurred, or in any way deteriorated due to the editing process. A close inspection shows that the birds have been retained with their original detailing, texture, and correct proportions, seamlessly fitting the night setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the tree branch and leaves appear naturally lit and integrate seamlessly with the starry night sky, without any obvious inconsistencies in shadowing or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branch and leaves in Image B need to coordinate in terms of lighting with the night theme, accepting subtle lighting from the moon and stars. Shadows play a crucial role in blending these elements realistically into the night scene. Image B shows appropriate shadowing and consistent lighting, with the branch and leaves harmonizing with the starry sky and moonlit ambiance, avoiding any visible incongruities.",
