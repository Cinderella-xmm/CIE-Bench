      "question": "Does the holographic projection screen emerge naturally from the phone without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic projection appears to be seamlessly emanating from the phone held by the person. The positioning and angle at which the screen is displayed suggest that it is purposefully aligned with the phone, giving the impression of a natural extension of the device's capabilities. This contributes to a smooth visual flow, as the screen appears well-integrated into the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or unnatural colors where the holographic screen connects with the phone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the connection between the holographic screen and the phone quite seamlessly. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistent colors at the juncture where the holographic display meets the phone. The technological theme maintained throughout the digital interface further supports the seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the dimensions of the holographic projection screen match the scale of the surrounding objects in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic screen in Image B appears to be proportionate to the phone and the human figure, taking into account that holographic displays generally occupy only a reasonable amount of space in such scenarios. It neither dominates nor is dwarfed by the surrounding elements, preserving a balanced scale within the scene.",

      "question": "Has the overall texture and detail of the sandwich been preserved despite the addition of the holographic screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic screen addition is in Image B, which is unrelated to the sandwich. The sandwich is not part of the image with the holographic screen; they are separate scenarios.",

      "question": "Does the background remain consistent and undistorted by the addition of the holographic projection screen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dark background establishes a contrast that complements the futuristic metallic blue tones of the holographic screen. The background appears consistent and undistorted, emphasizing the digital elements without interference.",
