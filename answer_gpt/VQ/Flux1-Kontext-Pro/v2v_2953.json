      "question": "Does the claymation texture applied to the cocktail glass maintain its structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cocktail glass is depicted with a claymation texture, which inherently simplifies the details seen in a realistic image. The texture applied has maintained the overall shape of the glass; however, the fine details such as the glass's transparency, reflections, and the clarity of the liquid and ice cubes are lost. Instead, the surface appears uniform and lacks the intricate details seen in real glassware. Therefore, the claymation texture introduces a more stylized rendition that incurs the loss of fine details typical of a clay animation, which is expected when transitioning from realism to stylization.",

      "question": "Do the ice cubes and liquid in the cocktail retain their visual plausibility and natural appearance after being converted into a claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ice cubes and liquid are depicted with a claymation style. The ice cubes are represented as solid shapes rather than intricate pieces of ice, and the liquid does not appear transparent. This interpretation results in a significant deviation from their natural appearance found in realistic images. In claymation, objects are often stylized, and this translation has flattened details and altered the appearance to match the typical claymation aesthetic, suggesting a loss of visual plausibility in replicating their natural look.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the lime slice and straw preserved without distortion in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime slice and straw are simplified in their depiction. The lime slice retains its basic crescent shape and the straw its cylindrical form, although both are now in a claymation style that renders them more solid and less detailed than usual. Despite the simplification, their geometric shapes are not distorted in a way that they become unrecognizable in their function or form. The change maintains structural integrity albeit in a stylized form.",

      "question": "Does the background, including the bar counter and bottles, retain its structural integrity and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background with the bar counter and bottles is translated into claymation, resulting in a significant simplification. The bottles are rendered as solid and featureless shapes, while the bar counter itself lacks the texture of wood grain found in a realistic image. Although simplified, the structural integrity in terms of size and placement remains coherent, and each object is identifiable as a part of a bar setting, but the fine detail and textural complexity are absent. This is typical of claymation aesthetics.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects logically consistent in the claymation design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cocktail glass, napkin, and surrounding objects in a claymation style. Despite the stylization, the proportions between these elements are consistent with what would be expected in their realistic counterparts. The cocktail glass sits on the napkin, with both maintaining their relative sizes to one another and to the background, suggesting logical coherence in their physical relationships and maintaining the proportional context.",
