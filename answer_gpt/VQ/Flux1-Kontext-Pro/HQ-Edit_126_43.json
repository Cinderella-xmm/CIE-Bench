    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the monocled eye on the front face of the clock seamlessly integrated into the original frame, with no visible seam or texture discontinuity around its perimeter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocled eye on the front face appears to be integrated into the clock, as there is no visible separation or disruption in the texture where it is placed. It matches the style and design of the surrounding clock frame, showing consistency with the original construction of a mechanical or designed element.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gear-like limbs extend from the side panels of the clock with continuous material flow and geometric alignment, showing no signs of floating or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gear-like limbs appear to be well integrated into the clock's structure. They connect at the side panels in a way that suggests intentional design, with no apparent gaps or floating elements. This alignment suggests a continuous flow from the clock's body to the limbs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the pendulum converted into a tail that extends downward from the bottom center of the clock, maintaining a smooth curvature and consistent material texture with the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no evidence of the pendulum being converted into a tail. The pendulum is visible inside the clock enclosure, while the tail-like structure protrudes from what appears to be a separate part. The tail does not maintain a smooth curvature or texture consistent with being an extension of the pendulum.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brass and copper tones applied uniformly across the clock’s surface, matching the lighting direction and showing realistic reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass and copper tones are applied across the clock's surface and appear to be consistent with the lighting source. Reflections and shadows are visible and add depth, suggesting a realistic portrayal of metal surfaces under lighting conditions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the steam valves placed at each corner of the clock’s upper section, protruding outward with clean edges and no overlap or deformation of the surrounding structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no steam valves distinctly identifiable at each corner of the upper section of the clock. Protrusions or features that resemble valves do not show a consistent pattern across all corners nor maintain the clean edges without deformation, as expected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the engraved patterns along the clock’s base and sides clear, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the original ornamental design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved patterns are detailed and seemingly consistent with a stylistic approach appropriate to the mechanical aesthetic. They appear clear and evenly spaced, aligning with the ornamental design principles of such a clock structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
