    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all fine details such as spikes, rivets, and surface scratches on the armor clearly visible and undistorted after miniaturization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the armored figure is enclosed in a glass dome and appears miniaturized. The fine details on the armor, such as spikes and rivets, along with surface scratches, are elements that commonly define the texture and intricacy of such a design. In the image, these details remain sharply defined without signs of distortion, indicating that the miniaturization process retained the intricate craftsmanship.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the glass dome enclose the figure without visible seams, distortion, or unnatural refraction effects that alter the appearance of the armor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome around the figure in Image B is designed to be a smooth and seamless enclosure. Glass domes can distort light, resulting in the warping of objects inside; however, in this image, the armor within retains its proportions and clarity, and there is no visible distortion or seam affecting its presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cogwheels at the base fully connected to the foundation, with interlocking teeth and consistent size ratios, and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base has cogwheels that are part of a mechanical-looking foundation meant to be cohesive. These cogwheels show interlocking teeth and a logical arrangement necessary for functionality, with no parts appearing disconnected or floating, suggesting a consistent and deliberate design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical wings securely connected to the shoulder armor, matching the metal texture and spike design, and free of unnatural bends or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature mechanical wings attached to the armor; instead, the design appears to emphasize spiked armor. Therefore, there is no opportunity for evaluating the attachment or texture of imaginary wings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the copper pipes follow continuous paths along armor joints, maintain consistent diameter and smooth bends, and avoid intersecting with key armor components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are details involving the intricate connections and elements like spikes, but no visible copper piping following paths along armor joints. Consequently, the continuous paths and intersection avoidance for copper pipes cannot be evaluated.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the brass orbs positioned at varying distances around the figure, not touching or clipping into the armor or dome, and displaying uniform material finish and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts brass orbs hanging around the dome, each at varying distances, without any appearing to touch or clip through the armor or the dome itself. The orbs retain a consistent and uniform finish under the lighting, reinforcing the care taken in their placement and design.",
