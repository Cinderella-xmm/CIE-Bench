      "question": "Does the glass dome cover the entire scene without distorting the underlying elements such as the house, tree, or ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is clearly enclosing the scene without any visible distortion to the house, tree, or ground. The transparency of the glass allows for clear visibility of all elements within it, maintaining the integrity of their shapes and positions. The dome appears to encapsulate the entire miniature landscape effectively.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mossy green pathways aligned with the terrain level and blended naturally with the surrounding ground texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy green pathways are placed on the terrain, appearing to follow natural contours of the miniature landscape. They are well-integrated into the sand and soil-like texture of the ground, suggesting a seamless and natural blend. The pathways do not protrude unnaturally or seem out of place, indicating a thoughtful integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the newly added shrubs have a size and texture consistent with the existing plants in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shrubs visible in Image B appear similar in size and texture to the existing vegetation, like the moss and tree, in the scene. They are proportionate to the small-scale environment and match the aesthetic consistently, with similar color tones and densities that coordinate well with the already present flora.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lake positioned on the ground with defined edges and a reflective surface that interacts realistically with surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B is positioned carefully on the ground, and its edges are defined by surrounding materials and vegetation. The surface of the lake shows reflections and interactions with the nearby bridge and plants, providing a realistic impression of water within the miniature scene. These reflections indicate a successful representation of water.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fairy lights wrapped around the tree branches in a way that follows their shape and emits a soft, uniform glow without harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fairy lights are delicately wrapped around the tree, following its form and branching structure. The illumination from the lights appears gentle and consistent, contributing a subtle and soft glow to the scene without creating overpowering highlights or shadows. This suggests the lights are well-implemented in a visually harmonious manner.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the bridge span the lake with stable supports and connect directly to the ground on both sides without floating or tilting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bridge in Image B spans across the lake, showing stability with supports visibly connected to both sides of the terrain. The bridge appears well-positioned and proportionate, properly intersecting the lake and integrating with the land without floating or tilting. The positioning aligns with how bridges are typically constructed over water.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all added elements (dome, lake, bridge, lights) rendered with materials and lighting that match the rustic, natural aesthetic of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the added elements in Image B—such as the dome, lake, bridge, and lights—are incorporated with care to maintain the rustic and natural aesthetic seen initially. The materials for the bridge resemble wood, typical in natural settings, while the lake, lights, and glass dome contribute to a cohesive atmosphere through subtle lighting and textural harmony with existing surroundings.",
