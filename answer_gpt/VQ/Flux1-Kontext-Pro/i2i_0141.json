      "question": "Are the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs free from unnatural textures and maintain detailed edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we observe that the couple's backs have been rendered as crystal silhouettes. The edges appear well-defined and crisp, maintaining the details necessary to recognize the shapes as representing human forms, which are essential for visual realism in depictions of crystal textures. The absence of rough or uneven textures contributes to a refined and detailed appearance, consistent with high-quality crystal interpretations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs integrate naturally with the background and the bench, without creating visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, when analyzing the position and integration of the crystal silhouettes, they blend effectively with the surrounding elements, such as the bench and trees. The continuity of lines and the coherence in overlap with the bench suggest a smooth integration. This natural interaction without visible breaks respects the spatial and structural logic of how objects should align in a real-world setting and ensure realistic visual coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs realistic and consistent with human anatomy, avoiding exaggerated or distorted forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The examination of the couple's silhouettes in Image B reflects accurate proportions consistent with typical human anatomy. The sizes of the heads, shoulders, and length of the torso conform to natural human dimensions. There is no indication of exaggerated or distorted forms, which supports the realism necessary for convincingly depicting human figures in various artistic styles, including a crystal-like representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the crystal material used for the silhouettes of the couple's backs appear three-dimensional and transparent, contributing to the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the choice of crystal for rendering the couple's backs contributes to a three-dimensional look due to the clear visibility of shape and form. The transparency effect allows background elements to be perceived through the silhouettes, enhancing realism by simulating the appearance of optical clarity in actual crystal materials. This characteristic aids in achieving a visually authentic and tangible representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the crystal silhouettes of the couple's backs still convey the impression that the couple is seated naturally on the bench, maintaining spatial coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the couple as seated on the bench using crystal silhouettes effectively. The spatial positioning of their backs with respect to the bench remains natural, reflecting a continued sense of seating through proper alignment with the horizontal slats and leg positioning. This spatial coherence is crucial to uphold the perception of natural interaction between subjects and their surroundings in a true-to-life manner.",
