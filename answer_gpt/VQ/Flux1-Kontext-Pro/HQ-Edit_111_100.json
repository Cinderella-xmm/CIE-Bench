      "question": "Does the entire surface of the LEGO statue display uniform brick textures with no visible patches of residual wood grain or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO statue shows a combination of LEGO bricks and other materials. The arms and legs are clearly colored yellow, and the rest of the statue is made of brown bricks. The presence of multiple colors suggests that there are inconsistent material transitions, hence it does not display a uniform brick texture. Therefore, some visible patches do exist that suggest residual wood grain, or transitions between materials.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the detailed carvings on the headdress, chest plate, and belt represented by small, precisely placed LEGO bricks that preserve the original patterns without loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a LEGO statue where detailed carvings are visible on the headdress, chest plate, and belt. These sections are molded and do not appear to be constructed from numerous small bricks that would be characteristic of standard LEGO construction aimed at preserving intricate details. Instead, the distinct LEGO texture is less apparent, which indicates a loss of some detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms, legs, and torso of the LEGO statue maintain natural human proportions with correctly scaled joints and limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso of the LEGO statue is proportionally represented with a conventional size related to human proportions; however, the arms and legs are oversized compared to real human anatomy, particularly the yellow portions which are distinctly blockish and lack natural human proportions. The joints are not correctly scaled, reflective of a typical LEGO form that is less natural.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both hands of the LEGO statue have five distinct fingers with natural finger positioning and no signs of merging or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the LEGO statue are constructed in a block form, typical of LEGO figures, which do not feature individual fingers. This indicates a merged structure without distinct or naturally positioned fingers.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the LEGO statue centered on a flat white pedestal with realistic shadows and reflections that align with the lighting direction in the gallery?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the LEGO statue positioned centrally on a white pedestal, and from the lighting and shadow direction, it appears consistent within the gallery setting. The shadow casting is realistic and aligns correctly with the overhead lighting direction visible in the image.",
