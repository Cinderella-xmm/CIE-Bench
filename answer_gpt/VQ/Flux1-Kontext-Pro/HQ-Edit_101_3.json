      "question": "Does the illustrated bird retain the original bird's body proportions and head-to-body ratio without exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bird illustration on the tea packaging mirrors the general shape and proportion of the bird in Image A. The bird's head and body appear balanced, similar to Image A, without signs of exaggeration or distortion. This consistency suggests that the illustrator aimed to accurately mirror the actual bird's proportions in their artwork.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms appear throughout the tea packaging design in a pattern that complements the overall aesthetic, without drawing in an unbalanced or disproportionate manner. While stylistically simplified, they maintain a proportionality and spacing similar to the real blossoms in Image A, suggesting an intentional design choice to mimic the original image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the yellow coloring on the bird is consistently applied, maintaining an even tone throughout the bird's body. This uniformity preserves the bird's texture details, avoiding any over-saturation or loss that might distract from the overall image quality.",
