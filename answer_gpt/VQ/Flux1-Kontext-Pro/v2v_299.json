      "question": "Does the airplane maintain its structural consistency despite being transformed into a stylized 3D cartoon version with chibi features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airplane has been transformed with elements that suggest a more stylized and cartoon-like version, such as bright red color and decorative motifs. However, the fundamental structure of the airplane, including its wings, fuselage, and engines, remains clearly intact and recognizable as an airplane. This indicates that despite artistic alterations, its structural consistency is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the festive red hues and golden motifs integrated seamlessly into the airplane's design without appearing unnatural or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the airplane with vibrant red hues and golden motifs. These are applied uniformly across the fuselage, tail, and wings, complementing the overall aesthetic without clashing with the original design. The motifs appear as artistic embellishments rather than awkward overlays, contributing to a cohesive and festive appearance.",

      "question": "Do the tassels hanging from the wings and the \"囍\" symbol on the tail appear natural and well-integrated into the image without causing any visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tassels and the '囍' symbol in Image B are stylized elements that fit the thematic transformation. Their integration appears deliberate, with the tassels logically placed at points on the wings where they would plausibly hang. The '囍' symbol is placed on the tail in a manner consistent with branding or artistic embellishment. These elements do not cause any visual inconsistencies or distortions, reinforcing the theme effectively.",

      "question": "Does the golden sunset background with floating Chinese lanterns enhance the festive atmosphere without disrupting the visual coherence of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a warm golden sunset with Chinese lanterns that enhance the festive and thematic mood of the image. The lanterns are appropriately sized and positioned to complement rather than dominate the airplane. The color scheme of the background aligns seamlessly with the airplane's design, preserving overall visual harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the airplane and background been preserved without noticeable loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the artistic modifications and thematic decorations, the textural details of the airplane, such as its surface reflections and structure, have been maintained. The background, with its sunset and clouds, also retains its smoothness and coherence. The image does not display any unnatural texturing or loss of detail, indicating careful editing.",
