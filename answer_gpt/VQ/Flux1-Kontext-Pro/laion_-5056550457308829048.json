      "question": "Does the basketball motif on Patrick’s shirt appear seamlessly integrated with the fabric texture, without visible seams, jagged edges, or unnatural color blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Patrick's shirt displays a basketball motif with his number '3'. The execution of this motif should ideally be smooth and consistent, embedded naturally within the fabric, appearing realistic without any standout visual faults. Given world knowledge, smooth integration implies neat design application without harsh separations or misalignment that defy normal textile application. The motif appears correctly placed and there’s no visible distortion, suggesting good integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are SpongeBob’s sneakers proportionally accurate and do they feature a clear, consistent cereal loop pattern without distortion or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "SpongeBob's sneakers in Image B should ideally exhibit a uniform design utilizing a cereal loop pattern. World knowledge dictates that proportionally accurate sneakers would mirror real-world shoes regarding shape conformity relative to SpongeBob's body. Here, the sneakers maintain appropriate dimensions, and while they mainly look well-integrated, there's no clearly observed cereal loop pattern on the sneakers themselves; any unique motif does not seem immediately apparent due to lack of clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cereal hoops surrounding the characters have consistent circular shapes, appropriate size relative to the figures, and realistic lighting and shadowing that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal hoops should display uniformity in shape and align with realistic light and shadow properties typical to the depicted environment. In Image B, the hoops or decorative motifs around the characters showcase consistent shapes. They blend effectively within the scene with suitable size proportions and shadows that mirror outdoor lighting, providing a coherent visual appeal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the urban sports background with graffiti elements stylistically consistent with the characters and free from obvious texture mismatches, such as sharp edges, incorrect lighting, or unnatural surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B needs to match SpongeBob and Patrick’s stylistic portrayal for a coherent image. It should lack abrupt texture transitions and fit seamlessly regarding patterns and illustrative style. Image B appears set against a more simplistic and whimsical outdoor backdrop rather than an urban sports theme. Hence, no graffiti or complex textural inconsistencies are visible, suggesting mismatch given narrative non-alignment (different style is consistently clear but doesn't fit 'urban sports' criteria).",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title “Basketball Breakfast Blitz!” clearly readable, properly aligned at the top of the image, and free from blurring, shadow artifacts, or overlapping with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For ease of readability, the title in Image B should present legibly without obstructions by artistic components like character props. Clarity implies text positioning in spacious zones without overlap, while proper alignment suggests consistency with header conventions where text is generally found. Image B does not display a visible title at all; thus, concerns around blurring, shadows, or overlaps are invalid, confirming absence rather than an execution fault.",
