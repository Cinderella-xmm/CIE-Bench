    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the tread patterns on the tire surfaces preserved and reinterpreted as armored segments with no visible texture repetition or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tread patterns on the tires are incorporated into the design of the robotic creature. The armored segments showcase complexity and depth, effectively reinterpreting the tread patterns into the creature's structure without showing any visible loss of detail or texture repetition. This suggests a careful and detailed transformation from tire treads into the armored segments, maintaining a high level of detail.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metallic joints within the wheel openings align properly with the original rim shape and appear physically connected without gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic joints within the wheel openings are integrated into the design of the creature's legs. The rims appear well-aligned with the wheels, with no noticeable gaps or deformations, indicating they are physically connected. This seamless integration suggests a careful editing process that preserved the shape and alignment between the metallic joints and the original rims.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the glowing mechanical eyes centered within the hub openings, emitting light consistently without haloing, pixelation, or unnatural brightness spillage onto adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing mechanical eyes are set within the hub openings, appearing centered and consistent in their light emission. The glow is controlled without overspill, halo, or pixelation that would cause unnatural brightness effects on surrounding surfaces. This indicates careful adjustment to maintain a natural look to the illumination effect.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the antennae attached to the upper portion of the tire stack with continuous, smooth geometry and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, antennae are depicted as emerging from the creature's back, creating an integrated robotic appearance. The connection points for the antennae show a smooth, continuous geometry, with no indication of disconnection or floating segments. The design appears cohesive and well-blended into the creature's form, suggesting that the antennae are deliberately and seamlessly integrated.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the entire structure composed of the tires forming a unified, balanced creature shape with no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tires are creatively arranged and incorporated into the mechanical design of a creature, achieving an overall balanced and unified appearance. The parts, including tires and metallic components, are scaled appropriately and consistently, contributing to a cohesive structure. There are no missing, duplicated, or incorrectly scaled parts, which results in a harmonious mechanical creature form.",
