    "Question": "Q1: Are the puzzle sections on the horse’s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse statue does not appear to have visible puzzle sections. The surface of the horse is smoothly painted with floral designs that are continuous and intact, without any visible interlocking edges typical of puzzles. This suggests that there are no distinct puzzle pieces forming the horse's surface.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the floral patterns on the horse’s body do not show any puzzle section boundaries. The floral design is smooth and continuous across the horse's surface, indicating seamless alignment. However, since no puzzle sections are defined, the question of alignment across puzzle edges doesn’t apply.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass covering over the horse shows a clear and realistic look. The transparency is consistent, and there are no visible distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that indicate poor simulation. The light reflections and refractions appear natural, suggesting a well-simulated glass material.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base displays a realistic wood grain and texture, which suggests a natural wood material. The compass is embedded in the base in a manner that aligns with the surface plane and is proportional to the scale of the base, indicating careful and accurate rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the antique-brass accents are located on the wooden base, specifically around the compass. These accents display a finish that appears to transition from matte to slightly reflective, which is consistent with the appearance of aged metal. They are situated logically within the design, enhancing the overall aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
