    "Question": "Q1: Are the facial features added over the star motif proportionally aligned and integrated without distorting the star’s shape or creating unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the star motif on the jersey remains a key design element. Based on the visual cues, the facial features do not appear to alter the shape or integration of the star, which is prominently placed against a flat blue background. This suggests the integration maintains the original proportions of the star motif without creating unnatural disruptions or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the motion lines surrounding the character have smooth, consistent strokes that align with the jersey's design language and do not exhibit pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The motion lines in Image B are vibrant and dynamic, enhancing the sense of movement. They exhibit smooth curves and consistent thickness, contributing to a fluid composition that aligns well with the streamlined design of the jersey. There are no noticeable pixelation or clipping artifacts, suggesting high-quality rendering akin to the jersey’s original smoothness.",

    "explanation": "In Image B, the additional elements are visually consistent with the original color scheme of the jersey. The motion lines and tagline utilize the blue, white, red, and gray palette, harmonizing with the existing design and maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. There's no visible color bleed or mismatch.",

It does not intersect or obscure any existing elements and is rendered in a clear, bold typeface that is easily readable. The alignment appears diagonal and intentional, enhancing the visual impact without distortion.",

    "explanation": "The jersey in Image B maintains its detailed texture and characteristic patterns, such as the 'DALLAS' text and mesh-like visual aspects. These features remain undistorted and cohesive throughout the design, despite the proximity of added elements like motion lines, preserving the fabric’s integrity and style.",
