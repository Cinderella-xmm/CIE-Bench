    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the model’s dress retain the same pebbled leather texture as the original handbag, with no visible smoothing, blurring, or texture repetition artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is entirely black, which prevents any analysis of texture, artifacts, or details. In the original image (Image A), a pebbled leather texture is evident on the handbag. Given that Image B lacks visibility, it cannot be confirmed if the dress retains the handbag’s texture or if any artifacts are present.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the shape of the dress consistent with the original handbag’s contours, especially around the base and shoulder area, without unnatural bulges, pinching, or loss of dimensionality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B is completely black, there is no observable shape or contour to compare with the original handbag in Image A, which has distinct contours. Without visible content, it is impossible to assess the consistency in shape and dimensionality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the gold accessories positioned naturally on the model’s body, with proper alignment and scale relative to the face and limbs, and do they appear anchored without floating or clipping through skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entirely black nature of Image B precludes any visual inspection of accessory placement, alignment, or interaction with a model, which is visible in Image A. Without any visual elements in Image B, there’s no way to determine the naturalness or positioning of accessories.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the MK logo charm clearly visible on the dress, maintaining its original circular shape and gold finish, without warping, stretching, or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the original Image A, the MK logo charm is distinct and visible. However, in Image B, the complete absence of visible content makes it impossible to assess the presence, shape, or any characteristics of the MK logo charm on the dress.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the background elements (runway, photographers, lights) align with the model’s position in terms of perspective, shadow direction, and depth of field, without overlapping or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pure black image of Image B lacks any background elements, like the runway or lighting, that can be seen in Image A. Without these visual elements in Image B, there’s no possibility to assess their alignment or perspective.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the entire model, text, and background contained within the vertical frame without any cut-off limbs, text, or objects, and is the layout vertically balanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's wholly black frame provides no information about any model, text, or objects within the image, which makes it impossible to determine if there is proper containment or vertical balance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text “Strut the City Streets” displayed in a clear serif font at the top of the image, without blurring, aliasing, or overlap with the model or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the total lack of visible content means no text can be evaluated or identified, unlike any readable text that might exist in an edited context. There’s no way to verify if the text is present, clear, or if there is any overlap.",
