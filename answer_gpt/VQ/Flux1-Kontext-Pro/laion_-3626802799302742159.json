      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) and limbs added to the cookies smooth, proportionally consistent with the cookie size, and free from pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, cookies have been anthropomorphized with facial features like eyes and a mouth, and limbs have been added. The eyes and facial expressions appear smooth, the features are in proportion with the size of the cookie, and there are no evident pixelation or jagged edges. This observation shows a seamless integration of the additional elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the transformed plate appear continuous, evenly distributed, and consistent with fabric texture, without visible seams or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question seems to be referencing a transformation of the plate to a textured fabric-like finish in Image B. However, Image B displays a cup on a plate with a consistent speckled design rather than any floral or fabric texture pattern. As this change does not exist in the image, the evaluation is based on the existing design which remains continuous and evenly distributed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the added miniature chairs and tea table positioned within the cup and around it in a way that respects physical proportions and does not cause overlapping or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no miniature chairs or tea tables added within the cup or around it. Thus, the question assumes an addition that is not present in the image, leading to the conclusion that the mention is inaccurate and thus cannot conflict with physics or appearance attributes.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the facial expressions on the cookies (grinning, pouting, winking) show clear differentiation in mouth and eye shapes while maintaining symmetry and natural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies exhibit different facial expressions, with clear differentiation in the shapes of the mouths and eyes. The grinning and other expressions maintain symmetry and natural curvature, effectively indicating varied emotive states while keeping the features well-formed and consistent.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the positions of the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table arranged in a way that suggests stable contact with surfaces and realistic depth, without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cookies are positioned realistically on the saucer and around the cup. They appear to be in stable contact with the surfaces. No chairs or a tea table are present, so they do not contribute to any confusion regarding floating or misplaced elements. The cookies' placement respects surface contact and depth perception.",
