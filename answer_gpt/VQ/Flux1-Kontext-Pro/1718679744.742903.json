      "question": "Does the bold black outline fully trace the crocodile's form without breaking or misaligning at joints, scales, or facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile is drawn with a bold black outline that defines its entire form including joints, scales, and facial features. The black outline is consistent and continuous around the crocodile's structure, effectively capturing its shape and details. The bold outline helps to maintain the integrity of the illustrated style, and the alignment is maintained without breaking or misalignments, making the drawing appear neat and orderly.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the hat and sunglasses vividly saturated but still preserving visible texture details like knit stitches and lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and sunglasses are portrayed with very vivid and saturated colors, typical of pop art style. However, the emphasis is on color rather than detail, so while the colors are bright and eye-catching, the texture details such as knit stitches and lens reflections are not preserved in the same way they would be in a more realistic depiction. Instead, the focus is on bold, vibrant flat colors over intricate texture details.",

      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the crocodile's skin repeat consistently across the neck, back, and limbs without gaps, overlaps, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's skin features colorful geometric patterns that are part of the artistic design. These patterns align with the body of the crocodile, creating a visually appealing effect. The patterns are smoothly integrated into the shape of the crocodile's neck, back, and limbs, without apparent gaps or distortions. They maintain a consistent style throughout the image.",

      "question": "Are the hat, sunglasses, and geometric patterns aligned correctly with the crocodile’s head and body, showing no floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat is placed onto the head of the crocodile, and the sunglasses are positioned to cover the eyes, while geometric patterns are applied consistently over the skin. Each element is accurately aligned with the form of the crocodile, and there are no indications of misalignment, such as floating away from the surface or being out of place.",

      "question": "Are the crocodile’s facial features, including the snout, teeth, and eye placement, proportionally accurate and undistorted despite the artistic modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crocodile's facial features, such as the snout, teeth, and eye placement, are stylized in a way consistent with the pop art style but maintain proportionality. The artistic design does not significantly distort the crocodile's anatomy; the snout and teeth are recognizable, and the eye's location fits the facial structure. Although stylized, the features remain proportionally accurate.",
