      "question": "Does the transformed king have smooth, flowing contours resembling water without jagged edges or disconnected fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed king is depicted with a flowing smoke-like element emerging from its top, which is smooth and continuous, resembling water. The contours are fluid and soft, not displaying any jagged edges or fragmented parts. This visual cue indicates an artistic representation intended to evoke a sense of fluid motion, akin to water or vapor.",

      "question": "Are the flame elements on the transformed queen composed of layered, tapering shapes that follow natural fire motion without abrupt transitions or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flame elements on the transformed queen exhibit a natural layering with tapering shapes, mimicking the organic flow of real fire. The flames have a smooth transition with no abrupt or pixelated edges, and they naturally extend from the piece, embodying the characteristics of a real flame.",

      "question": "Do the transformed knights display consistent stone texture with clear carving lines and no distorted proportions or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knight pieces exhibit a consistent stone-like texture with clearly defined carving lines. They maintain realistic proportions, and no visual anomalies like distorted shapes or floating fragments are present, contributing to a coherent and stable depiction of stone sculptures.",

      "question": "Are the transformed bishops rendered with soft, gradient edges and flowing lines that suggest motion without visible pixelation or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bishop pieces are depicted with soft, gradient edges that smoothly outline their shape. The lines suggest a sense of subtle movement and do not show any visible pixelation or ghosting effects, indicating a well-rendered transformation with an emphasis on fluid motion.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pawns have a mystical glow effect that is uniform and seamlessly integrated with their form. There is no halo effect that disrupts their appearance, nor are there blurred outlines that detach them from the chessboard, maintaining coherence within the imagery.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed rook resembles a tree trunk featuring clearly visible bark texture and legible runes carved into its surface. The structure of the rook remains intact without any noticeable stretching or warping, maintaining the intended artistic appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows cast by the transformed pieces align correctly with the light direction and correspond proportionally to the height of the objects. The shadows appear natural and correctly sized, firmly anchoring the pieces to the board, which is crucial for visual realism.",
