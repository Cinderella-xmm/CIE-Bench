      "question": "Does the giant manta ray seamlessly replace the surfboard, maintaining the surferâ€™s pose without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, instead of a manta ray, a large shark has replaced the surfboard. The man is now standing on the shark in a way similar to someone surfing. The pose of the surfer is similar to Image A, with no apparent distortion in his posture. The transition looks visually plausible, suggesting that the substitution was done with attention to maintaining the original pose.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Have the dreamy atmosphere effects been integrated smoothly, enhancing the image without creating unnatural artifacts or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display additional dreamy atmospheric effects compared to Image A. The environment appears consistent across both images, maintaining a natural look with clear skies and a normal ocean background without signs of added surreal effects or artifacts.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interaction between the manta ray and the waves visually credible, avoiding any apparent breaks in texture or geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the question refers to a manta ray, Image B features a shark interacting with the waves. The shark seems to be integrated well with the water, as the texture and geometry where the shark meets the waves do not show obvious disruptions or flaws. The interaction maintains a credible appearance, aligning closely with the wave's motion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the size and shape of the manta ray align naturally with the scale of the surfboard and surfer, avoiding disproportionate or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shark is large, resembling the size of a surfboard and is proportioned appropriately in relation to the surfer standing on it. The scaling between the shark, surfer, and the wave appears proportional and realistic in the context of the scene.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and edges of the manta ray free of visible artifacts, maintaining smooth transitions and natural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a shark instead of a manta ray, and its textures and edges appear to be free from visible artifacts. The shark's surface and its contours align well with the ocean waves, showing smooth transitions and preserving natural details without noticeable editing errors.",
