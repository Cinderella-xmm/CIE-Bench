    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the glass stopper on the bottle have a smooth, reflective surface consistent with real glass, and does it fit proportionally with the bottle's neck without appearing oversized or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stopper on the bottle is not glass. The bottle is fitted with diffuser reeds instead of a stopper, indicating that it's designed as a diffuser rather than a bottle for liquid storage. There is no appearance of a glass stopper fitting proportionally with the bottle's neck, as the reeds come directly out of the bottle-neck area, which fits the context of being a scent diffuser.",
