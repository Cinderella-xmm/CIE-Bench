      "question": "Does the outer box retain the rich mahogany color and wood grain texture that matches the original clock's frame, without unnatural shifts in tone or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outer box of the watch is visually identical to polished wood, likely simulating a rich mahogany color with visible wood grain texture. In the original image, the clock frame features an elaborately carved design, indicating an antique or refined wood texture. The outer box in Image B looks consistent with a real wood texture in color and grain detailing. There are no unnatural shifts in tone that can be observed, suggesting an authentic and consistent appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the modern watch positioned centrally within the box, with its face size and numeral style proportionally consistent with the original clock’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch is positioned centrally within the box; its face size appears proportional to the box's inner space. The numeral style on the watch face also mimics Roman numerals, similar to the original clock in Image A, appearing consistent with the original clock's face design. The proportion of the watch's face relative to its setting is appropriate and does not appear out of style with the clock's historic-themed design in Image A.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior lining resembles a rich, black velvet finish that is smooth and continuous.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the baroque decorative elements on the box fully detailed and three-dimensionally rendered, with consistent lighting and shadowing that match the original clock’s relief?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature baroque decorative elements on the box similar to those found on the clock's frame in the original image. The box instead has a smooth, simple design with no such ornamental detailing. Consequently, there is no evidence of detailed three-dimensional baroque elements, consistent light textures or shadows like those of the clock in Image A.",
