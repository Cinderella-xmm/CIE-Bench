    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without exaggerated or broken limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina figure within the snow globe appears to maintain correct proportions and joint alignment similar to a typical human form. The limbs and torso are positioned in a ballet pose, which is anatomically plausible. Examination of the arms, legs, and body suggests they align with typical human articulation without any noticeable exaggeration or disjoint. This reflects the pose as seen in Image A, indicating accuracy in replication without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the base of the snow globe display realistic bronze texture with subtle reflective highlights and clearly defined engraved French script, without pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns?",
    "explanation": "The base in Image B shows a design that mimics bronze, complete with reflective highlights characteristic of metal. The texture appears detailed, and engraved patterns or scripts seem well-defined and clear. There is no indication of pixelation, and the overall appearance maintains realism and avoids artificial-looking textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snowflakes within the globe are shown to be dispersed around the internal elements. They exhibit variation in terms of size, contributing to a natural floating appearance. There does not appear to be an evident repetition of patterns or clumping, ensuring a realistic depiction of snowfall.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
    "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower and other landmarks in Image B are scaled down to fit inside the globe, replicating miniature versions with attention to detail. The elements maintain proper perspective and structural integrity without any noticeable warping or flattening, which suggests careful consideration to preserve their iconic shapes within the confined space of the snow globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome of the snow globe shows a smooth curvature typical of such objects. The internal elements appear slightly refracted, which is consistent with the behavior of light through glass. The edges are smooth, and transitions are fluid, without any apparent jaggedness or abrupt changes, indicating a well-rendered glass material.",
    "answer": "Yes"
