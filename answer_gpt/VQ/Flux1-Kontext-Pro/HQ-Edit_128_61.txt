    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed tagine retain its original conical shape and base proportions, with no visible warping or deformation in the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tagine maintains a conical shape with its proportions consistent, suggesting no visible distortion. The base and top align naturally within its design. Evaluation relies on understanding common tagine dimensions, aiding in recognizing structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the arabesque patterns and gem-like details on the tagine's surface evenly rendered with consistent texture, lighting response, and material properties, without any visible seams or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows intricate arabesque patterns and gem-like details that remain coherent, suggesting familiarity with decorative arts. The texture appears smoothly integrated with consistent reflections under the lighting, indicating professional rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the smoke emerging from the tagine smooth, translucent, and flowing naturally, with a clearly defined but soft-edged genie silhouette that does not exhibit jagged lines or digital distortion?",
    "explanation": "The smoke in Image B flows naturally and is smooth, leveraging understanding of steam dynamics. It forms a genie-like silhouette that is soft-edged, effectively illustrating a mystical essence without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic threads and jewel-like elements on the fabric appear embedded within the textile weave, with realistic reflection and shadowing that matches the surrounding material?",
    "explanation": "The fabric in Image B contains jewel-like features and metallic threads, embedding within weave patterns. Realistic reflections and consistent shadows depict an understanding of textile design principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the shadows cast by the tagine and the smoke consistent with the light source direction, and do they properly interact with the fabric and surrounding environment without floating or misplaced areas?",
    "explanation": "Image B's shadows are consistent with lighting angles based on the visible glow near the tagine. The shadows interact correctly across different textures and surfaces, reflecting knowledge of light behavior in physical spaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
