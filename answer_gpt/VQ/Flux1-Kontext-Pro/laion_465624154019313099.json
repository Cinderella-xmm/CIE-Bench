    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes added to the cake positioned naturally on the surface without distorting the shape or texture of the meringue domes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are drawn onto the cake character's surface, which resembles the meringue domes. The cartoon nature of Image B allows for flexibility and does not indicate any distortion as the entire character is a stylized cake representation, not adhering to the realistic shapes as in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the strawberry is humorously used as a hat on the cake character. The artistic style of the image means elements like the strawberry are intentionally exaggerated for comedic effect, but there is no obvious distortion or unnatural stretching visually evident in this cartoon representation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the faint silhouettes of utensils in the background visually consistent with the lighting and depth of the scene, without introducing harsh edges or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes silhouetted utensils and characters, set up as audience figures to add context and depth. The shadows and silhouettes are drawn in a consistent manner without noticeable harsh edges or mismatched lighting contrasts, maintaining the cartoon's stylistic continuity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the strawberries and garnishes arranged around the cake in a way that maintains structural balance and does not overlap or distort the cake’s base or side layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a cartoon, uses strawberries and garnishes more as decorative elements that align with the character's design rather than realistic culinary decoration. Thus, they are not overlapping or disrupting the illustrated cake's structural form in the cartoon context.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake character’s expressions are animated, showing actions like shaking its head. Despite this, the cartoon style allows such movement without needing to adhere to rigid cake structure as in real life. The integrity appears consistent with a cartoon’s flexibility.",
