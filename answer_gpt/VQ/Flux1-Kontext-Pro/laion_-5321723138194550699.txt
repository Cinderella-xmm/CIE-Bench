    "explanation": "In Image B, the car is rendered in a comic style with clear, bold outlines typical of comic illustrations. These outlines adhere to the edges of the car's body, wheels, and wing, effectively capturing the shape and integrity of the car without breaks or misalignment.

    "Question": "Q2: Do the halftone dots on the car’s side panels and wing appear evenly spaced and consistent in density without visible banding or irregular clustering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the use of halftone dots is a common technique in comic art to convey shading and texture. The dots on the car’s side panels and wing appear evenly spaced and maintain consistent density, which is critical for achieving a smooth transition between color intensities and ensuring that there is no banding or clustering that would detract from the desired visual effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the dominant colors on the car (such as the wing and side panels) now rendered in muted orange, cream, and deep gray without any residual bright or unnatural hues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used on the car have been adapted to a comic style, often characterized by a more limited and stylized color palette. The muted orange, cream, and deep gray are intentionally chosen to ensure that no bright or unnatural hues disrupt the cohesion of the image, matching the typical color treatment found in classic comic illustrations.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the motion lines behind the car straight, evenly spaced, and aligned with the direction of travel without curving or intersecting improperly?",
    "explanation": "In the depiction of motion in comic art, lines are often used to indicate speed and direction. In Image B, these lines are straight and uniformly spaced, emanating from the rear of the car in alignment with its forward trajectory. Such alignment and spacing are crucial for visually conveying the notion of speed and direction without causing visual confusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

It is designed to be fully visible and intentionally placed where it does not interfere or overlap with the structural elements of the car, ensuring clear communication of sound effects without obstruction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Has the background behind the car been simplified into flat or textured blocks without retaining detailed figures or structures that conflict with the comic style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been simplified to maintain a comic style, characterized by minimalistic and sometimes abstract or textured elements. This approach ensures that complexity and extraneous detail do not distract from the primary focus of the image, which is the car itself, consistent with traditional comic aesthetics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Are the car’s wheels properly aligned with the axles, and do the suspension arms maintain correct angles and connections without bending or stretching?",
    "explanation": "In comic art, maintaining structural integrity is essential to preserve realism within an illustrated style. In Image B, the car’s wheels are depicted as properly aligned with their axles, and the suspension arms are shown at appropriate angles without distorting elements, reflecting attention to technical detail even in an exaggerated illustration style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
