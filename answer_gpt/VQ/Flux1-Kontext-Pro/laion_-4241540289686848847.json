      "question": "Does the long silver hair flow naturally without clumping, floating unrealistically, or showing visible seams or rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The long silver hair appears individually defined and exhibits a naturally flowing pattern, lying smoothly over the character's shoulders, which suggests high-quality rendering without clumps or artifacts.
