      "question": "Does the chibi-style parrot maintain smooth feather textures and proportional body parts without visible warping or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style parrot is designed with smooth curves and vibrant colors, maintaining a cartoonish aesthetic that appears intentional. World knowledge about chibi characteristics indicates that simplicity and smoothness are typical, and no warping or pixelation is noticeable in the parrot's body, feather textures, or facial features.",

      "question": "Are the oversized leaves around the branch proportionally larger than surrounding foliage without appearing stretched or unnaturally shaped?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the oversized leaves around the parrot appear to differentiate from other foliage by their size. However, they maintain a natural shape without any indication of stretching or distortion. The leaves seem purposefully larger, perhaps to emphasize the chibi style or scale, aligning with what would be expected in a stylized depiction.",

      "question": "Do the crystal beads on the leaves appear as clear, spherical droplets with subtle reflections and no visible digital artifacts or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the crystal beads on the leaves are represented as clear, spherical droplets with minimal reflections. They are clean and distinct, without any digital artifacts or smudging. This suggests a focus on clear rendering and attention to detail, typical of high-quality depictions.",

      "question": "Is the explorer positioned on a separate branch at a believable distance and scale, with correct limb orientation and no distortion in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the explorer figure is placed at a reasonable distance from the parrot on a separate branch. The scale of the explorer is proportionate when considering the chibi aesthetic, and the limbs appear correctly oriented without any visible distortion. The figure is designed to fit naturally within the scene and setting.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the glass dome exhibits a wooden texture that is consistent throughout, and the etched tribal patterns also maintain this consistency. The wood blends naturally into the overall rainforest ambiance, without any harsh edges or unexpected lighting disparities. This reflects attention to cohesive design and complementary textures.",
