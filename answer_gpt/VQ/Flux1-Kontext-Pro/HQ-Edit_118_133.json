    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the surface of the teapotâ€™s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object now has a ceramic appearance as opposed to a metallic one, with a high-gloss finish that resembles porcelain. The transition from the original intricate metallic design to the ceramic finish appears smooth and consistent. The visual cues show a clean, continuous surface with no abrupt transitions or texture artifacts that disrupt this effect, indicating a successful transformation in material representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the wick positioned at the tip of the former spout location in a straight, vertical orientation that aligns naturally with the candle design, without bending or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wick is placed at the top center, aligned vertically and naturally with the candle's design. It appears straight without any curves or bends, consistent with the expected orientation for a candle wick, rather than at the former spout's location as was seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B remains ceramic with a consistent white and gold accent, with no presence of wood or metal remnants. It retains the original shape and curvature seen in metallic form in Image A with no signs of warping or changes in thickness. The consistency in design indicates a precise conversion retaining structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns around the base of the teapot evenly spaced, proportionally scaled, and stylistically consistent with the existing engraved motifs, without overlapping or distorting the base structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative patterns at the base of the teapot appear balanced and well-integrated into the overall design. However, given the transition from engravings on metal to a cleaner ceramic design, these patterns might differ from their complexity and spacing in Image A. However, the new design stays true to ceramic styling, without any observed overlaps or distortion to the base structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text \"Eternal Elegance Candle\" placed centrally on the front face of the teapot in a flowing script font that matches the luxury theme, with no pixelation, shadowing, or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Eternal Elegance Candle' in Image B is prominently displayed, centered on the front face of the object. It is rendered in a flowing script font, consistent with the luxury and elegance theme. The quality of the text appears smooth without any pixelation, shadowing, or clipping, indicating a high-quality edit in maintaining the design consistency.",
