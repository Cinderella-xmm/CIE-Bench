      "question": "Does the handwritten word \"Draft\" on the yellow paper appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the word 'Draft' is written in a smooth, elegant script on the yellow paper. The contrast between the black ink or graphite and the bright yellow background is strong but consistent, showing no signs of unnatural glows, shadows, or other texture issues that might suggest artificial integration or digital alteration. Observing the blend and the shading, the letters remain uniformly clear against the paper without any color mismatches that might indicate overlay. Therefore, it appears seamlessly integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the style and material of the handwritten word \"Draft\" visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Draft' appears to be written in a style that aligns with handwritten sketches. The consistent width and flow of the lines suggest the use of a writing tool like a pencil, which matches the blue pencil shown in the first image. Pencils are commonly used in design sketches due to their flexibility and ease of use, and the script does not deviate from typical handwriting expected in such contexts.",

      "question": "Has the addition of the handwritten word \"Draft\" preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the yellow paper itself does not exhibit wrinkles, folds, or disruptions around the word 'Draft'. The text appears smoothly aligned with the surface of the paper, maintaining the flatness and evenness expected of undisturbed paper material. The addition seems to have been done cleanly without affecting the paper's structural integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the handwritten word \"Draft\" sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'Draft' in the edited image exhibits sharp and well-defined edges. There are no signs of pixelation, which would typically manifest as jagged or unclear resolution at the edges of the letters. The clarity implies that the text has been applied with precision, preserving the natural look of handwriting.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word \"Draft\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the pencil is poised above the yellow paper, as if ready to write or having just finished writing. This positioning is consistent with the appearance of the handwritten text, suggesting that it could indeed be the tool used to produce 'Draft'. The angle and scale of the pencil relative to the paper and text maintain a logical position, reinforcing the visual credibility of the scene.",
