    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the glass bottle positioned such that its base aligns with the original location of the rose petals and does not appear disproportionately large or small compared to surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a glass bottle with its base positioned in a manner that fits well within the surrounding elements and maintains an appropriate size in relation to them. The visual symmetry and proportionate size of the bottle ensure that it does not dominate or appear dwarfed by other elements, which indicates a well-balanced composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the petal etchings on the bottle surface continuous and evenly spaced, without visible gaps, pixelation, or irregular line breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analysis of Image B, the petal etchings on the surface of the bottle are depicted as smooth and reflective, with consistent spacing that avoids any disruptions or irregularities. The uniform design ensures that the etchings do not have visible pixelation or line breaks, contributing to a polished appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the gold rose-shaped cap exhibit realistic reflections and specular highlights that match the light source direction and do not appear overly shiny or uniformly colored?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold rose-shaped cap displays a variety of reflective tones and highlights that correspond with the expected direction of the light source. The specular highlights are well-integrated, adding realism to the cap's metallic finish without resulting in an exaggerated shine or bland uniformity.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the deep crimson gradient inside the bottle smoothly blended across the vertical axis, without visible color bands or uneven transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crimson gradient within the bottle in Image B is evaluated for its smoothness across the vertical axis. The color transitions seamlessly from one shade to another, devoid of any harsh bands or irregularities, creating a harmonious gradient effect that enhances the visual aesthetics of the bottle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the vertical gold logo clearly legible, evenly spaced, and aligned along the side of the bottle without warping, fading, or overlapping with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold logo on the bottle in Image B is assessed for clarity and alignment. The letters are legible, with even spacing and alignment that respects the vertical orientation of the bottle. There are no issues such as warping or overlapping, ensuring the logo stands out clearly and effectively without fading.",
