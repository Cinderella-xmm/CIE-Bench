    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the body of the seahorse exhibit a consistent translucent pink glass appearance with visible subtle bubble textures, and are there no areas where the texture appears jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is depicted with a translucent pink glass-like appearance. The surface texture appears smooth, shiny, and reflective, typical of glass materials, suggesting a carefully controlled rendering process. There are no noticeable jagged, inconsistent, or artificially applied textures on the body's surface, indicating a high-quality rendering. Although the texture might not exactly display bubble textures, it contains smooth, consistent properties throughout.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the yellow belly rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a precisely etched music note inside a heart, and are the edges of the symbol clean without blurring or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow belly in Image B appears to be rendered as a smooth, shiny surface, consistent with a glass material appearance. The music note symbol, located inside a heart, is rendered with sharp, clean edges and appears precise without any blurring or deformation, typical of a high-quality rendering process for objects resembling glass etching.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ribbons on the head and fins rendered as solid lavender glass with smooth surfaces and light reflections, and do they maintain their original shape without warping or appearing stretched or flattened?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the ribbons on the seahorse's head and fins in a solid lavender-like appearance, characteristic of a glass material with smooth surfaces and light reflections. They do not show any signs of warping or appearing stretched; instead, they retain consistent shapes and contours similar to those expected from a quality rendering of glass objects.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the seahorse positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that shows clear mirror-like reflections of its base and lower body, and is the stand seamlessly integrated without gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse is placed upon a flat, shiny black base, which reflects its lower body considerably well, demonstrating mirror-like qualities. The integration of the base with the seahorse appears seamless, as there are no visible gaps or any indication of the seahorse floating, indicating careful attention to the reflection and placement details during rendering.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—visually consistent in lighting, shadow, and material properties, with no mismatched highlights, color shifts, or artificial edges suggesting poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All of the components—body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—in Image B exhibit a cohesive appearance in terms of lighting, shadows, and material properties. The highlights and reflections are consistently rendered across the various surfaces, maintaining a natural lighting and material cohesion without any sudden color shifts or artificial edges, suggesting a unified rendering quality.",
