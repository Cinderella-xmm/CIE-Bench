        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the head of the chibi keychain appears enlarged, which is typical for chibi-style figures. The curls of the hair are represented with smooth curves, and no distortion in the overall shape is visible. Given the context and style of chibi art, the proportions intentionally prioritize the head, maintaining the structural integrity of features in a stylized manner.",
