    "Question": "Q1: Does the cylindrical glass body maintain consistent curvature and transparency, with the embossed patterns clearly visible and proportionally scaled across the surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a pocket watch with intricate patterns against a wooden backdrop, without a clear cylindrical glass body. The watch is metallic and has ornate designs that would be embossed, but since there is no glass cylinder, it's impossible to evaluate curvature and transparency. Hence, this question is not applicable to Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the label 'Timeless Reserve' centered within the circular area, with Roman numerals uniformly positioned along its perimeter and matching the font style and size of the original clock face?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a watch face with Roman numerals positioned around it. However, there's no visible label 'Timeless Reserve' in the image. The Roman numerals are uniformly placed along the perimeter of the clock face but unrelated to any label. Therefore, the question about the label is not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the top ring now resemble a functional bottle cap with a cork stopper that has a natural porous texture, and are the gold accents seamlessly integrated without visible seams or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the top ring is depicted as the winding crown of the pocket watch rather than resembling a bottle cap with a cork stopper. The winding crown does not show any characteristics of a bottle cap or cork texture. Gold accents are present on the watch but are part of the ornate design rather than a bottle cap integration.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ornamental scrollwork patterns preserved with full depth and clarity across the curved glass surface, showing no signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The ornamental scrollwork patterns in Image B are preserved on the metallic surface of the pocket watch rather than glass. They appear clear and detailed without signs of stretching, compression, or pixelation, but they are not on a glass surface, making the question's context inapplicable.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the reflections and shadows on the glass bottle align with the lighting direction of the scene, and are there no visible seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities at the boundaries between the bottle and the wood?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a metallic pocket watch with reflections and shadows that align with the lighting direction on the wooden backdrop. However, there is no glass bottle, and thus no seams, ghosting, or texture discontinuities related to a bottle. The watchâ€™s placement against the wood is seamless, consistent with the scene's lighting.",
    "answer": "No"
