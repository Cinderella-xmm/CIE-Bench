      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral pattern on the suit jacket appears to follow the natural contours of the lapels and shoulders.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow tie features a geometric design that appears symmetrical.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dotted texture in the background in Image B is notably consistent in its spacing, size, and density, creating a uniform effect that is often used to bring a pop art style or comic book appearance.

      "choices": [
        "Yes",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadowing across the floral suit and graphic bow tie are consistent and relative to the shirt and the colorful background.
