    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe clearly defined and aligned correctly, without warped edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe are well-defined and maintain a consistent alignment, comparable to the typical geometric design elements found in many athletic shoes. The edges appear smooth without warping or segments missing, suggesting a proper preservation of the shoe's original design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wood grain lines flow naturally across the shoe's surface, following the contours of the panels and laces, without repeating or pixelated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood grain lines exhibit a natural flow that contours along the shape of the shoe, including the panels and laces. There is a lack of visible repetition or pixelation, which indicates that the wood texture has been applied uniformly across the shoe's surface, maintaining a realistic appearance.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the laces depicted as solid wooden strands with consistent width and proper threading through the eyelets, maintaining their original path and tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laces are designed as solid wooden strands that maintain a uniform width and are properly threaded through the eyelets. They preserve the original path and tension one would expect from a conventional shoe lace configuration, lending a realistic wood-crafted effect to the shoe.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the darker and lighter wood tones create a clear distinction between the shoe's main body and highlights, such as the toe cap and midsole, without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the use of darker and lighter wood tones creates a clear distinction between different parts of the shoe, such as the main body, toe cap, and midsole. These tonal variations help define the structure and contours of the shoe without introducing any unnatural color shifts, thereby providing depth and realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brand names and logos (e.g., \"Salomon\", \"Speedcross\", \"Contagrip\") clearly readable and accurately positioned on the shoe, with clean edges and no blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brand names and logos are not visibly present or readable. This suggests a lack of clear branding or detail application in the transformation to a wooden texture, contrary to typical branding placement seen in athletic shoes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the outsole feature deep, well-defined treads and a reinforced toe cap, with consistent depth and spacing that matches the original shoeâ€™s geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shoe features an outsole with distinctly carved treads that mimic the depth and spacing found in a performance shoe. The toe cap appears reinforced, maintaining the structural features typically present in the original shoe design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the wooden shoe placed on a clean, flat shelf with soft shadows beneath it, suggesting a stable and realistic display environment without floating or misaligned positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden shoe is situated on a flat, clean shelf that casts soft shadows below it. These shadows contribute to a stable and realistic display environment, indicating the shoe is properly aligned with the shelf surface without floating or positioning issues.",
