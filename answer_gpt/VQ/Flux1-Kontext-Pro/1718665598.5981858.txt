    "Question": "Q1: Are the road sections composed of clearly defined angular shapes that align logically with the perspective and curvature of the original road, without floating or misaligned fragments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the road is depicted using angular shapes that follow the expected perspective and curvature as seen in the original image (Image A). The lines representing the road edges and the lane markings maintain continuity and adhere to the visual path of the road without indication of floating or misalignment. This suggests a logical alignment consistent with the scene's geometry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the cloud formations consist of layered quadrilateral shapes that overlap in a way consistent with atmospheric depth, without abrupt edges or disconnected blocks?",
    "explanation": "Image B portrays the cloud formations using a series of overlapping quadrilateral shapes which give a sense of depth as they layer over each other. The clouds maintain a cohesive look without abrupt edges or appearing disconnected, indicating an effort to preserve atmospheric depth through this stylistic choice.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the telegraph poles rendered as angular or geometric structures that maintain vertical alignment and proportional relationships between the pole and crossbars, without visible warping or structural collapse?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the telegraph poles are depicted as clear geometric structures resembling their real-world counterparts in Image A. They maintain a consistent vertical alignment and the proportional relationships between the poles and crossbars are coherent, without any visible warping or structural distortion. This reflects an intentional angular rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the tree canopies represented as solid triangular or pyramid-like shapes that sit naturally on the ground and do not float above the terrain or intersect with the road guardrails?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tree canopies are abstracted into solid shapes with a triangular or pyramid-like design. They sit naturally on the landscape, adhering to the ground rather than appearing to float or awkwardly intersect with nearby structures like guardrails, preserving the integrity of their placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors across the road surface, sky, and surrounding vegetation uniformly distributed within the specified muted palette, without isolated bright spots, color bleeding, or textural noise?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a muted color palette across various elements such as the road, sky, and vegetation. There is a uniformity in color application that avoids any abrupt bright spots, color bleeding, or disruptive textural noise, maintaining a seamless consistency across the entire image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
