      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes on the chibi character appear consistent with the original pattern without unnatural distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra maintains its characteristic black and white stripes, which are smooth and continuous across its body, without any awkward breaks or distortions. This indicates consistency with typical zebra patterns. Zebras have distinctive striping patterns by nature, and the patterns in the edited image align with the expected natural design observed in zebras.",

      "question": "Does the chibi zebra's interaction with the miniature cake appear natural and free from any obvious artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is seen closely approaching the cake, which has a zebra-like pattern on it. The positioning of the zebra's nose near the cake appears natural, as animals often display curiosity towards objects. There are no visible artifacts or distortions in their interaction, which suggests a seamless visual relationship between the zebra and the cake.",

      "question": "Is the chibi zebra seated on the edge of the Instagram frame in a way that appears structurally coherent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of the zebra being seated or positioned in a way that contradicts physical plausibility. The zebra's body is positioned naturally within the frame, and no part of it suggests any unnatural or improbable structural integration with the digital frame. Thus, its alignment within the given space appears visually credible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the inclusion of the username \"ZebraLover\" and social media icons blend seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates the Instagram elements such as the username \"ZebraLover\" and social media icons above and around the main image. These elements are integrated in a way typical of social media interfaces, appearing as an overlay. While they do not blend into the natural background as purely photographic elements, their placement follows an established interface logic, thereby not disrupting the overall scene as they align with what users expect in digital device displays.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the materials used for the chibi zebra and the cake natural in appearance, without any obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the zebra and the cake maintain appearances that suggest realistic textures. The zebra's fur and stripes appear lifelike without any unusual or synthetic texture issues, and the cake's surface, albeit stylized with zebra-like patterns, doesn't display any odd or artificial surface characteristics. Both elements cohere with a realistic and naturally plausible visual style.",
