      "question": "Does the marbled ceramic finish on both vases display consistent, smooth patterns without visible texture breaks or artificial repetitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, you can observe that both vases exhibit a marbled ceramic finish. This finish appears smooth and consistent, with natural marble-like patterns that do not show any abrupt texture breaks or repetitive patterns. In ceramics, marbling should mimic natural stone patterns, and these vases seem to achieve this effect. Therefore, the finish appears well-executed with no visible issues.",

      "question": "Are the branding decals applied to the vases clearly visible, proportionally sized, and aligned with the surface curvature without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vases in Image B have branding decals in the form of gold leaf accents. These decals are visible and appear well-proportioned relative to the size of the vases. They are aligned with the curvature of the surface, with no evident distortion or misalignment, which is critical for maintaining the intended visual appeal on curved surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents on the vases show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil applied to curved surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold leaf accents on the vases in Image B show realistic highlights and edge definition consistent with metallic foil application. Such accents typically reflect light, providing a metallic sheen and clear definition along their edges. The visibility of the highlights and the way they follow the curve of the vase suggest that they are executed in a manner consistent with real metallic foil accents.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cross-sectional illustration on the packaging box accurately depicting the internal petal arrangement of the vases without geometric mismatch or incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible cross-sectional illustration depicted on the packaging box. Without such an illustration present, it's not possible to assess the accuracy of the petal arrangement depiction relative to the vases.",

      "question": "Is the bronze typography on the packaging box legible, evenly spaced, and free from blurring or unwanted shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze typography on the packaging box in Image B is clear and legible. The spacing appears even, contributing to a professional look, and there are no signs of blurring or unwanted shadows that could interfere with readability. Typography on packaging is key for effectively communicating brand information, and here it is precise and sharp.",

      "question": "Are the two vases still symmetrical and proportionally accurate compared to the original, with no stretched or compressed sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon comparing Image A and Image B, the vases maintain symmetrical shapes and proportional accuracy. In Image B, they do not appear stretched or compressed in relation to how they are depicted in Image A. The vases maintain their design integrity, supporting the overall aesthetic consistency between the two images.",
