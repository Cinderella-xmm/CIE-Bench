      "question": "Does the compact, chibi-style 3D book inside the snow globe maintain its structural integrity without any broken geometric shapes or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book inside the snow globe in Image B appears as a simplified, compact version, often referred to as 'chibi-style,' which is characterized by its exaggeration and reduction in detail for a cute effect. Upon examining Image B, the book maintains a coherent structure with clear outlines and evenly spaced lines representing pages. There are no visually discernible distortions, broken shapes, or textures appearing out of place, fitting well within the chibi aesthetic. This suggests that the book's structural integrity is sustained, showcasing a polished design consistent with common chibi representations in art.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the added elements like the snow globe, shelf, surrounding books, and library backdrop integrate naturally with the original minimalist design without disrupting the overall visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces additional elements such as a snow globe, shelf, books, and backdrop, which convey a cozy library setting. These elements are arranged in a way that complements the book-centered design of Image A. The subdued lighting and neutral color palette used in these new elements align with the minimalist nature of the original image, avoiding overly bright or clashing colors that could disrupt visual harmony. The scene achieves a balance between detailed and minimalist components, producing an integrated visual experience.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the snow globe, the chibi-style book, and the surrounding objects physically rational and consistent with the original image's central focus on the book?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains the chibi-style book as its central element, ensuring the book remains the primary focus. The snow globe itself is engineered to logically fit on the shelf space, while the book's size is large enough to be prominent inside the globe. Compared to Image A, the focal emphasis on the book remains consistent despite additional context from surrounding objects. All elements harmonize proportionally, respecting the spatial relationship that keeps the book central.",

      "question": "Does the soft golden light from the nearby lamp and the sparkles cast by the snow globe appear natural and enhance the scene's warmth without introducing unrealistic shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B incorporates soft lighting from a lamp and sparkles from the snow globe, yielding a warm, ambient scene. The lighting casts gentle highlights and shadows typically expected in a cozy indoor environment. These lighting elements appear harmonious and realistic, complying with common lighting behaviors, such as soft diffusion on the shelf and books, enhancing the scene's warmth and magic without inciting any stark, unnatural contrasts or lighting discrepancies.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B encapsulates a snowy environment with floating sparkles and a book with implied page movement.

The execution appears fluid and aligns with the magical aesthetic often seen in such designs, portraying believable conditions of gentle air circulation inside the globe. The details do not seem contrived but naturally integrate into the scene complementing the overall ambiance.",
