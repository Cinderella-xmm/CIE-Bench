      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the three figures retain anatomically correct body proportions and natural hand shapes (with no more than five fingers per hand) after being stylized as ink-painting poets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, examining the figures reveals proportionate and anatomically consistent body shapes. The hands also appear to have the correct number of fingers, not exceeding five, matching common human anatomy. Artistic stylization in ink painting often retains realistic proportions to maintain the elegance and harmony of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the willow branches and lotus leaves rendered with smooth, flowing brushstrokes that preserve their natural form and do not exhibit jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the willow branches and lotus leaves through smooth and flowing brushstrokes typical of traditional ink paintings. These strokes appear free of jagged edges or texture artifacts and capture the natural forms of both elements. The brushwork effectively conveys the grace and subtlety associated with traditional ink artistry.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mountain background feature soft, layered ink-wash gradients that blend naturally with the surrounding mist and sky without sharp transitions or artificial blur effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain background is represented with soft, layered ink-wash gradients. These gradients blend seamlessly into the surrounding mist and sky, achieving a harmonious composition without noticeable sharp transitions or artificial blur effects. This style is characteristic of traditional landscapes in ink painting, where a gentle gradient is used to depict depth and atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the arm and hand positions of the figures show natural joint alignment and fluid motion, with no bent or missing fingers or unnatural limb extensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures in Image B exhibit fluid and natural poses. The arm and hand positions are aligned correctly, presenting joint and limb movements that are convincing and comparable to natural human motions. There are no bent or missing fingers, or exaggerated limb extensions, maintaining anatomical correctness while capturing the fluidity typical in ink painting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ink-style elements (figures, willows, lotuses, mountains) harmoniously integrated into the scene with consistent lighting, shadow, and depth cues, and do they avoid appearing detached or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elements in Image B are well integrated into the scene through consistent use of lighting, shadow, and depth cues. Each component, from figures to landscapes like willows and mountains, is seamlessly composed within the image. The use of ink painting techniques supports this integration, avoiding any appearance of detachment or misplacement, and enhancing the overall unity and harmony of the artwork.",
