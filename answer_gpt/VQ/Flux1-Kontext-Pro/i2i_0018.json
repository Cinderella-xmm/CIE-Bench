      "question": "Does the exaggerated and elongated clock tower retain its structural consistency and does it appear logically consistent with the original proportions of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is stylized and stretched to give it a more exaggerated and elongated look. This is common in artistic renditions or caricatures where key features are distorted while maintaining basic attributes, like texture and clock face. The artistic style deliberately alters proportions, deviating from the original structure seen in Image A, where the tower is more proportionate. Therefore, this elongation does not maintain logical consistency with the original proportions.",

      "question": "Are the colorful geometric flowerbed rings natural in appearance, lacking any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows flowerbed rings that are defined by bold outlines and geometric shapes typical of enamel badges or illustrations. This style inherently lacks the complex textures found in real flowers as depicted in Image A. The enamel style prioritizes color and shape over intricate detail, creating a naturally stylized effect, not meant to mimic real textures. Therefore, they appear unnatural compared to real flowers.",

      "question": "Does the transition from the chibi-style illustration elements to the glossy enamel coloring look smooth and free of visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between illustration elements and enamel coloring appears smooth. The glossy finish and clean outlines in the badge formation are typical of quality enamel work intended to create an appealing visual. There are no artifacts like pixelation or blurriness that would detract from visual quality. Hence, the transition appears smooth and well-executed.",

      "question": "Does the clock tower and flowerbed badge maintain a vertical, metallic structure consistent with a city souvenir badge, without any structural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock tower and flowerbed in Image B are designed as a single vertical and consistent collectible badge structure. The typical souvenir badge style, with metallic outlines and glossy finishes, maintains structural integrity without distortion. The badge element is clear and intended as a souvenir with consistent form and detailing.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style transformation of the clock tower and flowerbed retain a natural and authentic appearance, avoiding any obvious distortions or unrealistic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style transformation in Image B is inherently stylized and not intended to mimic realistic proportions or appearances seen in Image A. The deliberate choice of exaggerated elements like a stretched tower and simplified flowerbed are stylistic features, creating unrealistic but artistically coherent visuals typical of chibi and enamel designs.",
