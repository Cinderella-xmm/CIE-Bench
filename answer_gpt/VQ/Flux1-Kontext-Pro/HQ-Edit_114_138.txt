    "Question": "Q1: Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silk robe is transformed into a more stylized representation. The fabric texture appears less realistic and more illustrative, with floral patterns looking more like those found in illustrated art. The highlights and colors seem flat, typical for artistic renditions. The patterns do not follow the realistic light interaction or fabric texture that real silk would exhibit, as the stylization alters these properties.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book is rendered in an illustrative style, but the shape, page layers, and depth are maintained. The book retains a consistency in its thickness, and there are no obvious discrepancies like floating components or broken edges. The depiction respects the structural coherence of a closed book being opened.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the bookshelf is drawn with illustrative details, including book spines and shelf alignment. Although the style is more decorative, the alignment and spacing are maintained, replicating the visual layout of the original. However, the intricacy of wood grain texture is replaced with a more cartoonish approach, losing some credibility but keeping enough structural rationality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
    "explanation": "Image B includes additional illustrated elements like bookmark panels or paper representations around the book. These are placed in a way that maintains the visual logic of being related to the book, although they are more stylized. There is no indication of floating or being misaligned within this art style context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",
    "explanation": "This question is not applicable to the image provided, as the face is deliberately blurred, preventing any judgment of facial feature accuracy. Therefore, the analysis does not apply.",
    "answer": "No"
