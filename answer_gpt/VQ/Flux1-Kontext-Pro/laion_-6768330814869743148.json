      "question": "Do the pastries in the edited image maintain their original shapes without distorted or stretched forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the pastries such as the cookies and madeleines appear to maintain their recognizable shapes, recognizable through their outlines and proportions typical to such pastries. Despite the stylistic alterations, the forms of the pastries are consistent and not distorted or stretched, suggesting intentional stylization rather than alteration in shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bread slices' internal textures clearly visible and consistent with real bread, or do they appear overly stylized with uniform patterns that lack natural variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents the bread slices with an even and stylized texture. The natural variation that would typically be seen in real bread, such as crumb irregularities and color variations, appears to be replaced by a uniform, artistic pattern that does not depict realistic bread texture, indicating an artistic representation rather than an attempt to reproduce realistic details.",

      "question": "Do the muffin liners show clear geometric patterns that still align with the shape of the muffins and do not float or detach from them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, while there is a heavy stylization applied, the muffin liners have a geometric pattern but still appear to align with the general shape of the muffins. They maintain contact with the muffins and do not seem visually detached or floating, adhering to the expected interaction of liners and muffins.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the checkerboard pattern applied uniformly across the tray surfaces without breaking the perceived depth or causing unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, a checkerboard pattern is artistically added to the tray surfaces. This pattern respects the surfacesâ€™ structure and doesn't disrupt the perceived depth; therefore, it maintains a sense of uniformity without causing the surfaces to appear unnaturally flat or distorted.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the abstract shapes in the background positioned in a way that matches the depth and alignment of the original cup stack, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abstract shapes that replace the original cup stacks in the edited image align with the depth positioning of the original image. They maintain a semblance of stacking and proper alignment. There is no indication that these shapes float or overlap inappropriately, thus retaining a visual continuity with the previously observed layout.",
