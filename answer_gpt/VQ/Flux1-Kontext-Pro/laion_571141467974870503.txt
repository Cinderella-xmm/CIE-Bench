    "Question": "Q1: Are the bold primary colors applied to the train's body consistent across all surfaces without visible color bleeding or mismatched tones?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, bold primary colors are used prominently across the train's body, featuring bright yellow, white, and blue tones. Upon examination, these colors are applied consistently on various surfaces of the train without noticeable color bleeding or mismatch in tones. This suggests careful attention to color application, a characteristic often seen in graphic or pop art styles. Therefore, based on the visual consistency and smooth transition of colors, the bold colors appear to be consistently applied.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the halftone dot patterns on the train display consistent size, spacing, and alignment across all visible panels without distortion or clustering?",
    "explanation": "The halftone dot patterns on the train in Image B are intended to create a textured effect commonly used in retro graphic designs. When analyzing the train's panels, the dots maintain a consistent size and are spaced evenly, avoiding distortion or clustering. The alignment is coherent throughout the surface, indicating a uniform application of the halftone technique, typical of poster art and comic-style renditions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the geometric shapes used to replace the barn’s wood texture aligned with the original architectural elements such as windows, doors, and roofline without breaking their structural boundaries?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the barn's texture is replaced with geometric shapes that provide a stylized representation. Despite this transformation, these shapes align well with the structural elements like windows, doors, and the roofline. They respect the boundaries of these architectural features without disrupting the barn's overall form. This disciplined alignment ensures that the essence of the original structure is preserved in the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the graphic bursts representing foliage positioned in a way that respects the original spatial layout, with no overlapping or misplaced elements that contradict the scene’s depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, graphic bursts of foliage preserve the spatial layout as seen in Image A. The representation mimics the placement of trees and plants, respecting the depth and perspective of the scene. Elements fit naturally in their respective areas without awkward overlaps or misplacement, maintaining the visual balance and structural coherence found in landscape paintings and graphical representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the black outlines around the train, barn, and foliage uniformly sharp, continuous, and free from gaps or misalignments at object edges?",
    "explanation": "Image B emphasizes black outlines to delineate objects, a common technique in graphic design to enhance visual clarity. These outlines around the train, barn, and foliage are sharp and continuous across edges, with no discernible gaps or misalignments that could disrupt the integrity of object boundaries. This approach maintains object definition, a key aspect of stylized and illustrative artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"
