      "question": "Do the transitions between the front, left side, and rear views of the car appear smooth and free of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, which presents the edited image as a collage of car views, I carefully examine the transitions between the front, left side, and rear views. Each view is displayed independently within its frame, and the consistency in design, color, and alignment is maintained throughout. This means there are no obvious breaks or errors in the design that would indicate unnatural artifacts. The visual flow from one view to another appears smooth and cohesive. Thus, the transitions do not reveal signs of artifacts or editing discrepancies typically seen in poorly edited images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the car parts consistent and logical across the three views without showing any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the car in a series of views: front, angled front-left, and rear. By analyzing each part of the car, like the wheels, windows, and main body, the design appears consistent and well-proportioned. Using world knowledge of car design, any distortion would typically manifest as oddly shaped components or irregular dimensions. Since none of these elements appear in the edited image, the proportions and angles are logical and consistent across the views.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car's surface texture and material properties, like reflections and shine, appear uniform and realistic across all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's red paint finish shows reflections and highlights that are typical for a glossy, polished vehicle surface. The consistency in these highlights and the way light interacts with the car's surface, such as on the hood, windows, and sides, suggests a well-rendered texture. These reflections and the realistic shine indicate uniformity across different perspectives. A consistent reflection pattern helps ensure the realism of the material properties throughout the image.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow effects consistent and correctly aligned across all three views of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the light seems to be coming from a similar angle in each view of the car. The shadows cast by components like the mirrors and wheels are in alignment with the light source direction, ensuring natural continuity in lighting. Any major inconsistency often results in unrealistic appearance across the views, but this image maintains a coherent lighting pattern, which helps preserve visual integrity.",

      "question": "Does the background seamlessly integrate with the car without introducing any jarring inconsistencies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background, which includes elements like a driveway and vegetation, provides a consistent environment for the vehicle across different views. The uniformity of lighting on both the car and background reduces likelihood of mismatched integration, avoiding any jarring or displaced elements. There aren't visible inconsistencies like mismatched shadows or shifts in background perspective that could be off-putting or unnatural.",
