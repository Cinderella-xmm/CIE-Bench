      "question": "Does the embroidered silk gown on the woman's upper body display natural fabric draping and consistent texture without visible seams, blurring, or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown in Image B presents a luxurious appearance with intricate embroidery and consistent material texture. The fabric drapes naturally, consistent with the expected characteristics of high-quality silk material used historically. There are no visible seams, blurring, or abrupt color transitions that would suggest any editing anomalies. The design aligns with how traditional gowns are structured and appear, particularly in formal and historic attire.",

      "question": "Is the feathered velvet cap positioned correctly on the head, with feathers extending naturally without overlapping the face or appearing detached from the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B appears correctly positioned. The feathers extend naturally from the hat's base, without overlapping the blurred face or seeming detached. The feathers' positioning and integration into the cap indicate a coherent design typical of period attire, demonstrating a realistic appearance without editing discrepancies.",

      "question": "Does the palatial corridor background align properly with the subject's perspective, showing consistent depth and lighting without visible seams or distortion at the edges of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the corridor background complements the subject's perspective. The depth and lighting are consistent, blending naturally with the subject's position and stature. There are no visible seams or distortions along the edges of the figure, which points to a well-integrated backdrop maintaining consistent architectural style and lighting typically found in palatial settings.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lace fan held in the right hand with natural finger positioning, correct number of fingers, and no deformation or clipping against the hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing Image B, the lace fan is held in a typical manner with the fingers wrapped around it naturally. The correct number of fingers is visible, and there are no signs of deformation or clipping which suggests a realistic gripping posture. This adherence to natural anatomical positioning and interaction with objects confirms the absence of typical editing errors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transition between the newly added silk gown and the lower garment (shorts) appear seamless, with no visible gaps, unnatural creases, or conflicting material textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's no visible transition since the gown completely covers the lower part. The gown's design inherently includes a continuous fabric flow without visible shorts or mismatched textures. The gown appears uniform and whole, with any lower garment presumably covered by the gown.",
