      "question": "Does the word \"warm\" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'warm' is placed atop the painting in the top left corner. Despite its addition, it doesn't introduce any unnatural textures or disruptions to the image's natural appearance, as it is simply an overlay and does not appear to alter the underlying visual elements or colors in an unnatural manner.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the addition of the word \"warm\" at the top left corner maintained the structural consistency of surrounding elements like the sofa and cushions, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the word 'warm' at the top left corner only overlays the painting and does not interact or interfere with the sofa and cushions structurally. These elements remain visually consistent and undistorted, indicating that the text addition did not affect them adversely.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the size and font of the word \"warm\" maintain visual plausibility and authentic integration with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font used for 'warm' is bold and clear, and its size does not overwhelm other elements in the image. It fits in well with the aesthetic of the room, maintaining visual plausibility and a sense of integration without appearing out of place or overtly modern.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner added in a manner that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'freedom' is added at the bottom right corner. It overlays the carpeting and appears finely integrated without introducing artifacts or losing detail in the visible elements of the floor or the nearby plant. Therefore, the addition does not seem detrimental to the underlying visual details.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner respect the structural integrity of nearby elements, such as the corner of the rug and plant pot base, without causing any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of 'freedom' overlays a part of the rug without causing distortion to the structural integrity of surrounding elements. The rug's texture and lines remain visually intact, and neither the plant nor its pot base appears distorted, suggesting careful integration of the text.",
