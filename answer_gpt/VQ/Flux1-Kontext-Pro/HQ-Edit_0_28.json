      "question": "Are the abstract geometric patterns on the man's robe seamlessly integrated into the fabric without introducing visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the man's robe appear to be harmoniously integrated with the fabric, maintaining a consistent texture and color. The geometric designs are neatly aligned, showing no signs of mismatches, jagged edges, or abrupt color changes. The use of coherent design elements suggests a well-executed pattern application, consistent with traditional garment ornamentation, which leads to the conclusion that the integration is seamless.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transformed lamp bases retain recognizable brass-like material properties and maintain proportional geometry consistent with their original structure when stylized as corner flourishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the corner flourishes designed to resemble the lamp bases still showcase the same brass-like sheen and warmth. The design keeps the proportion and geometry synonymous with the original brass lamp bases, suggesting careful stylization that adheres to the brass material's properties. The resemblance in sheen, texture, and form indicates continuity between the original and transformed elements.",

      "question": "Is the extended portion of the bookcase visually continuous with the original section, showing consistent shelf spacing, book alignment, and lighting without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookcase extension in Image B maintains a seamless continuation from the original section, with shelf spacing and book alignment remaining uniform. The lighting is consistent across the shelves, and there are no noticeable seams or distortions. The visual continuity suggests a meticulous integration process, ensuring the extension is visually coherent with the existing structure.",

      "question": "Are the script elements embedded within the bookcase surface rendered with appropriate transparency and scale so they do not obscure books or create unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are no visible script elements embedded within the bookcase surface in Image B, suggesting that either these elements were not added, or their design and implementation ensure they do not interfere with the visibility of books. As a result, they do not create any unnatural overlays or obscure the existing elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the area intended for inspirational quotes display a clean, unobstructed region with consistent lighting and texture that allows for future text placement without visual disruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area meant for inspirational quotes is seen at the bottom of the image. It is framed by decorative elements and remains clean and unobstructed, with consistent lighting and texture throughout. This setup allows for easy text placement in the future without any interference from other visual elements or disruptions in lighting.",
