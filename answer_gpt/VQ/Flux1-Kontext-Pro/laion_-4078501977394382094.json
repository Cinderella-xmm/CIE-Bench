      "question": "Does the roof of the van in Panel 1 tilt upward at a plausible angle without distorting the side panels or creating visible seams or breaks in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the van's roof appears well-integrated with the body of the van. The tilt of the roof is subtle and does not disrupt the overall shape of the vehicle. There are no visible seams or breaks between the roof and the side panels, indicating a smooth and realistic connection. The angle does not appear implausible and maintains the structural integrity of the van's design. This suggests the edit is executed cleanly without distorting the perspective or appearance of the side panels.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cactus in Panel 2 transformed into a spout with continuous curves and matching texture, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the cactus on top of the van is depicted with flowing curves, resembling a spout. The texture of the cactus matches the expected texture based on its botanical nature, with a smooth visual transition into the spout-like shape. The shadows cast by this element align with the established lighting direction seen in the scene, adding to the realism of the transformation from cactus to spout.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added plants around the oasis in Panel 3 rendered with the same level of detail and color harmony as the original cacti, and do they cast shadows that align with the scene’s lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, additional plants are visible around the oasis. The rendering shows intricate details on the leaves and trunks, similar to those of the cacti depicted earlier, thus maintaining consistency in terms of detail level. The colors of these new plants harmonize well with the pre-existing environment, ensuring they do not stand out unnaturally. Furthermore, their shadows are cast in a direction consistent with the scene’s lighting, reinforcing the authenticity of their integration into the environment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles in all three panels positioned so they do not overlap critical parts of the van or landscape, and do they use a font style and size that matches the handwritten \"Road Trip\" title?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In all panels of Image B, the text bubbles are carefully placed to avoid overlapping critical visual elements like the van or key landscape features. They appear in free spots of the background, maintaining the visibility of important parts of the scene. The font style and size used in the text bubbles do not match the handwritten 'Road Trip' title seen in Image A, as the 'Road Trip' title has a more artistic and flowing script style, while the text bubbles use a simpler font.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the water splashes in Panel 3 show droplets with varied sizes and arcing paths, and do they appear to originate from the van’s side without floating unnaturally above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 3 of Image B, water splashes around the oasis depict a range of droplet sizes and natural arcing paths that suggest motion and fluidity. These droplets seem to be integrated into the scene rather than originate from the van, as no such detail is visible directly linking the splashes to the vehicle. The imagery and context suggest the splashes are more related to water features (e.g., from the oasis), and they do not float in an unrealistic manner above the ground.",

      "question": "Are the headlights in Panel 2 enlarged and brightened but still contained within the original housing, and do they retain their round shape without stretching or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2 of Image B, the headlights of the van may appear prominent due to stylistic choices, but they remain contained within their original housing structures. The circular shape of the headlights is preserved without any stretching or clipping effects. The brightness might be increased for emphasis, yet it does not distort the characteristic form of the headlights, ensuring they appear distinct but not exaggerated in size beyond their natural confines.",
