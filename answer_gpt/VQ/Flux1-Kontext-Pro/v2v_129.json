      "question": "Are the character's proportions in each sticker consistent with the Chibi style without any unnatural distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Chibi style is characterized by shortened and exaggerated proportions, often depicting characters with large heads and small bodies. In Image B, the stickers follow such proportions, displaying enlarged heads compared to the body, but not so much that it becomes distorted or geometrically brokenâ€”the proportion is typical for Chibi depiction.",
