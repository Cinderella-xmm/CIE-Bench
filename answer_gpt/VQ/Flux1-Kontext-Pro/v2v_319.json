      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine maintain the structural consistency of the man climbing the ladder, avoiding any unnatural distortions or deformations?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, which features a chibi-style figurine, involves assessing its proportions and structural accuracy. Chibi designs often stylize human figures with exaggerated proportions, such as larger heads and smaller bodies. Despite the stylistic elements, the figurine maintains the recognizable posture and structural integrity of a man climbing a ladder, without visible distortions or deformations. The methodical placement of limbs and torso aligns well with climbing action, confirming visual consistency.",
