    "Question": "Q1: Does the checkmark pathway appear naturally tangled without breaking its geometric integrity or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pathway has been modified with additional tangled lines to mimic red tape. The integrity of the original black checkmark remains intact, with smooth curves and consistent thickness. There are no abrupt interruptions or artifacts that break the geometric shape, maintaining the natural flow of the design even after adding illustrative elements. Thus, it retains its integrity and does not contain unnatural elements.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the red tape motif blend naturally into the orange circular step markers without causing visual disruption or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the addition of red tape motifs around the orange step markers. These motifs are integrated in a way that does not block or obscure key details of the markers. The blend is visually coherent, and despite the added complexity, the motifs do not cause significant disruption in visibility or detail loss within the markers.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the icons and text within the orange circular step markers still legible and structurally consistent after the addition of the red tape motif?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, even with the introduction of red tape motifs around the orange step markers, the icons and text inside these markers remain clearly legible. The structural integrity of these elements is preserved, and they do not appear distorted or difficult to read, indicating that the added motifs do not interfere with legibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the infographic maintained its clarity and sharpness without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
    "explanation": "Overall, Image B retains clarity and sharpness throughout the design. Despite the additional elements, there are no new textures that appear out of place or cause a significant degradation of the image's detail. The fine details and the readability of the text and icons are preserved, ensuring the infographic remains clear.",
