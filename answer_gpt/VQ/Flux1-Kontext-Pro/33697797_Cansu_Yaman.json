      "question": "Do the transformed plants maintain recognizable plant-like structures without unnatural appendages or disproportionate body parts?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plants appear to have transformed into fantastical, fairy-like structures that deviate from typical botanical forms. They have vibrant colors and exotic shapes that include appendages resembling fantasy creatures, such as horns or magical items. These features are not typical of usual plant structures, indicating that the plants do not maintain recognizable plant-like forms without unnatural elements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a lush, verdant greenhouse with vine patterns integrated into various elements.

      "question": "Do the magical orbs replace the original flowers in the same positions and emit light that interacts realistically with nearby surfaces and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed structures include magical orbs in place of flowers. These orbs appear to be positioned atop the fantastical plant-like pedestals, where flowers might traditionally be located. They seem to emit light and interact with the environment, creating a realistic glow that affects the surfaces and shadows nearby, consistent with natural light interactions.",

      "question": "Are the shelves positioned above the ground with soft shadows beneath them that align with the light source and do not show unnatural gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, shelves filled with plants are positioned above the ground with shadows cast beneath them, consistent with the light source's direction. However, Image B doesn't feature conventional shelves but rather features fantastical mushroom-like structures instead, which do not show unnatural gaps or floating effects but instead follow a magical theme involving light and plant interaction.",

      "question": "Does the iridescent foliage cascade from the ceiling in a way that follows the structural lines of the roof frame and allows light to diffuse naturally through its layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, iridescent foliage and various fantastical elements hang and cascade from the ceiling, following the structure's geometrical design. These elements align with the roof's structural lines, and the light appears to diffuse naturally through these layers, contributing to the magical and harmonious atmosphere of the scene.",
