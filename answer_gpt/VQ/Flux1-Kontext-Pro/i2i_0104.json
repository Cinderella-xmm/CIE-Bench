    {

      "question": "Does the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" introduce any unnatural textures or visibly distorted areas on the cat's fur, whiskers, or eyes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The text is placed in areas (above and below the cat) that are separate from the cat's physical features such as fur, whiskers, and eyes. There is no overlap of text onto these detailed areas. The visual integrity and details of the cat's features remain unaffected by the text addition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the placement of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" maintain structural consistency and avoid disrupting the proportions and physical rationality of the cat's face and body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text is strategically positioned at the top and bottom of the image, outside the main area where the cat's face and body lie. Therefore, it does not interfere with or alter the proportions or structural consistency of the cat's image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the natural appearance and authenticity of the cat's expression, fur pattern, and posture been preserved despite the addition of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\"?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text is added in a way that does not interact with the content and features of the cat itself. The cat's expression, fur pattern, and posture appear unchanged and maintain their authenticity and natural look.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the cat, such as individual strands of fur, whiskers, and paw pads, free from blurring or pixelation after the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the edited image, the strands of fur, whiskers, and paw pads remain clear and detailed, with no visible signs of blurring or pixelation introduced by the text addition, sustaining the high quality of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the integration of the text \"Warm Home\" and \"Adopt Love\" into the image avoid logical inconsistencies such as overlapping unnaturally with the cat's fur or appearing embedded in a way that defies common sense?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text is placed in a border above and below the cat image and does not intersect or embed within the features of the cat itself, avoiding any logical inconsistencies or unnatural overlap with the cat's fur.",
