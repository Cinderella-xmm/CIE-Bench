    "Question": "Q1: Are the corners and edges of the hotel building preserved with consistent angles and proportions, and is there a clear transparent boundary (glass) enclosing the scene without warping or breaking the structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel building appears to be inside a glass structure, commonly known as a diorama. The corners and edges are intact and the building is preserved with consistent angles reflecting a realistic proportion for a miniature setting. The glass boundary clearly encloses the scene without compromising the proportions or causing warping of the structural features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the water layers in the pool show consistent transparency and refraction, allowing visibility of submerged objects and swimmers without jagged edges or color artifacts?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a miniature representation, where the pool appears as a resin or similar material in dioramas, demonstrating consistent transparency expected in such models. There are no visible swimmers, which aligns with a miniaturized model where minute details like submerged objects aren't reflected with transparency due to scale perceptions.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the sunbathers on the lounge chairs have correctly proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, and do the nearby trees display natural leaf density and branching without pixelation or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sunbathers and trees reflect a miniature representation. The sunbathers exhibit simplified limb proportions typical for tiny figurines, lacking detailed clothing. Trees visually show modeled leaf density aiming to represent realism without pixelation in the given context of a diorama.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the greenery flowing from the rooftop follow a continuous, downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points, and does it blend naturally with the building’s exterior without floating or clipping issues?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases greenery cascading from the rooftop consistently along the building's side in a miniature scenario. The greenery maintains attachment points and blends with the building's miniaturized exterior, avoiding floating or clipping due to the model's design adapted for a controlled display space.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the beach accessories near the pool edge correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture, and do they have natural material textures (e.g., fabric, plastic)?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, beach accessories like lounge chairs are scaled appropriately to fit the diorama’s size; however, details and textures are simplified for miniature models chiefly displaying intended placement without overlapping issues. Textures are apparent but not natural due to diorama design limitations.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the floating 3D clouds exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clouds appear as crafted elements in the diorama, floating above the miniature. They exhibit soft gradients typical for model clouds, hovering without intersection, maintaining consistency with the scene’s lighting setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
