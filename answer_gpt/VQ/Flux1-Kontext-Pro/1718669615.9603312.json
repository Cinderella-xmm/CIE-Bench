      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the spaceship retain a coherent circular shape with consistent proportions, and are the added circular motifs and meander patterns aligned symmetrically without warping or overlapping irregularly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a large pottery-like object, with patterns that resemble those found on ancient Greek or Middle Eastern pottery. The circular motifs and meander patterns appear symmetrically aligned, maintaining consistent proportions across the surface. The overall shape, resembling a vase, is circular with no signs of warping or irregular overlapping of the motifs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the painted patterns on the spaceshipâ€™s surface free from digital artifacts, such as jagged edges, unnatural brushstroke textures, or inconsistent color gradients that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painted patterns on the pottery surface are smooth and well-rendered, with no visible digital artifacts. The brushstroke textures are natural and consistent, and the color gradients across the surface blend seamlessly without jagged edges or unnatural irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the abstract wave forms in the landscape below continuous and smoothly curved, avoiding sharp breaks or abrupt transitions that disrupt the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape in Image B consists of abstract wave forms that are smoothly curved. These forms flow continuously, maintaining aesthetic consistency without abrupt transitions or sharp breaks that would disrupt the design's flow.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the colors in the transformed landscape consist exclusively of muted earth tones (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) without any bright or out-of-place colors like neon greens or electric blues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a landscape filled with muted earth tones. The colors are consistent with natural earth shades, such as browns, tans, and dark reds, without any presence of bright or out-of-place colors like neon greens or electric blues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the edited spaceship positioned at a consistent altitude above the abstract landscape, with proper perspective alignment relative to the curved railway tracks below?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pottery-like object maintains a consistent altitude above the landscape, appearing to float symmetrically above the curved tracks. The alignment and perspective with the landscape below are maintained appropriately, giving a coherent visual impression.",
