    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the 3D printed display model and display plaque appear naturally integrated into the image, without disrupting the scene’s overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D printed display model features a detailed design, and the plaque appears professionally executed. Both are positioned logically within the transparent showcase glass, typical in tech expos, aligning seamlessly with the overall exhibition setup in the background, which suggests authenticity.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the texture of the 3D printed model resemble matte PLA plastic realistically, without showing any unnatural surface irregularities or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface texture of the model looks consistent with how matte PLA plastic appears, typically smooth with visible layering characteristic of 3D printed materials. There are no visible surface imperfections or anomalies disrupting the expected plastic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the display plaque at the base positioned correctly, maintaining structural consistency and contributing to the visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display plaque is uniformly positioned under the model, consistent with typical exhibition setups, contributing positively to the scene's structural integrity. Its alignment and presentation seem intentional and professionally executed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition between the original elements and the new tech expo booth background appear seamless, avoiding any obvious artifacts or unnatural segmentation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background’s integration with the showcase and the displayed elements is consistent, with no visible artifacts, segmentation, or discrepancies in lighting or perspective that would suggest unnatural blending. The expo booth environment complements the display setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the proportions of the 3D printed model and the display plaque realistic and consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario, avoiding any noticeable distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model's proportions resemble those of a typical bulldog, and the size relationship between the model and the plaque aligns with common exhibition standards, with no apparent distortions. This consistency aids in maintaining the scene’s realistic portrayal.",
