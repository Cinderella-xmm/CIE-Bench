    "Question": "Q1: Do the chibi-style 3D characters retain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortions in their facial features and body shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters have been placed inside a snow globe. A chibi-style character typically maintains exaggerated proportions with a large head and small body, designed to look cute. The characters in the snow globe appear to maintain a proportionate appearance similar to their portrayal in Image A, with their facial features and body shapes looking consistent and appropriately scaled within the globe. There are no noticeable distortions that deviate from what would be expected in a chibi style. This suggests a careful editing process to retain a natural and consistent proportion typical of chibi characters.",
