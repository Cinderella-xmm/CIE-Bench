      "question": "Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jigsaw pieces are scattered around the central book. The edges of the pieces appear smooth and are designed to interlock, as is typical for jigsaw puzzles. There are no gaps or overlapping deformities visible, indicating that the design of the pieces is coherent and follows the usual characteristics of interlocking puzzle pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon patterns on the jigsaw pieces seem to be in a darker wood stain compared to the compass area, which is lighter. The transition between these colors appears smooth and natural, reflecting typical wood staining techniques that allow for gradual transitions. There are no abrupt or unnatural transitions that would indicate poor editing or unrealistic coloring.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood grain texture on each puzzle piece is visibly distinct and naturally varies across the pieces. There is no evidence of repeating patterns, which would suggest an artificial overlay, nor is there any noticeable smoothing effect that might indicate an editing tool. This natural variation in the wood grain adds to the realism of the puzzle pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the puzzle pieces are scattered around the book in a manner that appears physically plausible. Each piece is flat against the wooden surface without signs of floating or overlapping that would defy gravity or perspective. This indicates careful editing to maintain a realistic and natural layout of the pieces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central compass is clearly visible on the book cover. It retains a perfect circular shape with fine internal details, indicating no distortion. The engraved lines and divisions within the compass are precisely rendered, showcasing the high-quality design and execution of the engraving.",
