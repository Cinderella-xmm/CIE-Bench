      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and grin added to the energy blast positioned within the glowing orb and aligned with its curvature, without creating jagged edges or broken light paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and grin are shown inside a bright glowing orb that presumably represents energy blast. Observing carefully, the facial features are proportionate and do follow the curve of the orb, which suggests alignment with the curvature. They do not disrupt the light flow or create jagged edges. Given the nature of cartoons and energy displays, this integration appears smooth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the dialogue bubble positioned so that it does not overlap with Naruto’s face or hand, and does it have clean borders and readable text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a dialogue bubble above Naruto which says, 'PREARE YOURSELF!' It is clearly placed at a strategic position, not overlapping Naruto's face or hand. Among cartoon depictions, bubbles are usually distinct with clear fonts, which is the case here, although 'PREARE' might be a typing mistake in 'PREPARE'. The bubble encompasses the text well without border irregularities.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the motion lines and energy beams from the spirit and Naruto’s attack converge smoothly at the fusion point, showing continuous flow without abrupt breaks or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motion lines and energy beams are seen converging at a point, likely depicting an impact or fusion, identified as the 'Ultimate Fusion Strike'. The artistry shows continuity in the lines and beams without visible interruptions or misalignments. The convergence appears smooth, aligning with common expectations in animated energy depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the energy-heavy backgrounds typical in animations, fragments and particles respond to surrounding light, creating a sense of depth. In Image B, debris and fragments are visually integrated with the scene's lighting. The light and shadow are consistent across these objects, suggesting depth and motion rather than a flat appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does Naruto’s face retain the original number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband position, with no distorted lines or missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Naruto's face is visible with several concise traits: three whisker marks on each cheek, a characteristic eye shape, and a forehead protector (headband) placed above his brows. Each element is perfectly rendered without missing marks or distorted lines, retaining Naruto’s iconic design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the action bubble placed in a visible area of the image without covering Naruto’s hand or the fusion point, and does it use consistent styling with the dialogue bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there's an action bubble with the text 'ULTIMATE FUSION STRIKE!' It is located strategically below and to the right, where neither Naruto’s hand nor the crucial fusion point is obscured. It maintains a stylistic consistency with the dialogue bubble in terms of typography and visual design.",
