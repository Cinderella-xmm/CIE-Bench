    {

      "question": "Do the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head, without warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows large ears with a celestial pattern, such as cosmic designs and starry elements. Given the elephant's head size in Image B, the ears appear proportionate to it, maintaining natural attachment points without visible stretching or distortion of the surrounding skin. The ears resemble typical elephant ears in size and position, following expected anatomical features.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk smoothly integrated into the scene without jagged edges, overlapping artifacts, or inconsistent opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mist in Image B, featuring a glowing, cosmic appearance, flows from the trunk in a smooth fashion. It blends well into the scene with no jagged edges or visible artifacts. The opacity transitions gradually, creating a natural and fluid integration into the environment, as expected from such artistic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the planetary rings around the elephant's legs evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes, without clipping into the leg surface or appearing misaligned due to perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the planetary rings are not explicitly present around the elephant's legs. The focus is on a starry and cosmic-themed texture rather than rings. Therefore, no misalignment or clipping issues exist due to the absence of such features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it, with no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The star patterns in Image B are integrated into the elephant’s skin and display an embedded appearance. They follow the contours of the feet, appearing as a part of the skin texture without any floating effect. There is no visible haloing or color spill, ensuring a coherent integration with the elephant’s feet.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the galaxy-patterned skin follow the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution and avoiding abrupt transitions or stretched patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The galaxy-patterned skin in Image B appears to naturally follow the folds and creases of the elephant's body. The texture resolution is consistent, with smooth transitions that do not interrupt the curvature and surface details of the elephant. The pattern integrates seamlessly, maintaining the realism of the body's natural contours.",
