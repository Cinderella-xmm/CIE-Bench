      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character design is stylized as a cartoon kernel personified with a pumpkin spice theme. The kernel is anthropomorphized, wearing autumn attire, which is not meant to maintain the realistic size or texture of actual corn kernels. The clothing is seamlessly integrated with this style rather than matching the realistic texture or edges of real kernels. Given this is a cartoon, it is purposely integrated to look like part of the character design without concerns of real-world texture consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy lines drawn around the popcorn pieces are stylized to give a sense of excitement and movement. They radiate outward and do not intersect with the popcorn shapes. The lines maintain smoothness and directionality without distorting the popcorn, enhancing the magical and whimsical theme of the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the popcorn piece wearing an explorer hat is illustrated in a whimsical and fantastical style. The hat complements the kernel's character, fitting well with its size. The spice and pumpkin elements in the surrounding scene are positioned clearly without overlaps or distortions. The scaling and positioning are consistent with the stylized, cartoon theme of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature the actual motion or placement of popcorn pieces entering bowls as it focuses more on a narrative and character depiction in a cartoon style. Hence, popcorn entering bowls under gravity constraints isn't depicted. The scene does suggest movement and arrangement, but within the stylized, static illustration confines, making this question inapplicable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors used for added elements like hats, energy lines, and spice illustrations are well-integrated into the overall palette of warm, autumnal hues of orange and brown. They maintain a consistent color theme without over-saturation or bleeding, enhancing the coherence of the visual style while maintaining clarity and vividness.",
