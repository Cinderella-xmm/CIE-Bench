    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wallet is represented by a schematic outline that is cleanly drawn with straight, continuous lines, ensuring that the proportions and shapes appear accurate and geometrically complete. The edges are smooth, and there are no jagged areas or gaps in the outline, indicating a precise and tidy design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The schematic lines in Image B are evenly thin and display a uniform thickness throughout, without any evidence of smudges or varying line weights that might suggest texture or artifacts. This consistency gives the schematic a clean and professional appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text annotations for USD, QAR, and INR are not present adjacent to the banknote slots; instead, these annotations appear in graphs below the wallet image. Thus, they do not overlap the notes, but they also are not directly associated with them as described.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the exchange rate charts and country economy icons aligned horizontally or vertically in a balanced manner, with no floating or misplaced elements that disrupt visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exchange rate charts positioned below the wallet image in Image B are aligned horizontally, maintaining a balanced layout. Each chart is distinctly labeled 'ECONOMY' and positioned in a way that complements the wallet design, thereby supporting a coherent visual flow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the visible banknotes (USD $20, QAR 10, INR 50) retain clear denominations, readable text, and intact designs without blurring, stretching, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of banknotes within the wallet schematic is stylized, lacking the color and detail necessary to verify clear denominations, text readability, or intact designs as in a photographic image. The schematic nature inherently lacks fine details, making it difficult to evaluate features like blurring or pixelation accurately.",
