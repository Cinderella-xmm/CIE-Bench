    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brushed metal and matte finishes applied consistently across the robot’s body without visible texture artifacts or inconsistent sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot appears to have a consistent texture and finish. The visual cues, such as the consistent color tones and reflections across the surface, suggest a uniform application of materials. There are no visible texture artifacts or inconsistencies in sheen, which implies a smooth application of the finishes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hexagonal box fully enclosed around the robot with clean edges, proper proportions, and a clearly legible \"MECHA VANGUARD\" label without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hexagonal box appears to be fully enclosed with sharp and clean edges that maintain proper proportions relative to the robot. The 'MECHA VANGUARD' label is clearly legible and seems to be free of any distortion. The proportions appear intentional and well-constructed, further suggesting the completeness and quality of the box design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces clear and non-blurry, and do the joint areas (elbows, knees) show no signs of geometric distortion or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces appear clear and sharply defined, without any signs of blur, indicating a high level of detail and resolution. The visual inspection of the joint areas like elbows and knees shows well-defined connections without any visible geometric distortion or missing segments, suggesting precise modeling and rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the cityscape background extend behind the robot without clipping through its limbs or body, and does it match the lighting direction and scale of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background seems to consist of a cosmic or digital theme rather than a cityscape, which fits seamlessly behind the robot. There is no overlapping or clipping of the background through the robot’s limbs or body. The background elements match the lighting direction and are appropriately scaled, complementing the primary subject of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces correctly aligned and positioned without overlapping or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all elements of the robot, including limbs, weapons, and armor pieces, appear to be properly aligned and naturally positioned. The spatial arrangement respects physical logic, with no evidence of overlapping or floating elements. The positioning supports the integrity and realism of the robot's design and structure.",
