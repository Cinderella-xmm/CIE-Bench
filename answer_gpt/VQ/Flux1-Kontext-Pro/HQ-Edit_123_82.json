        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly wings are proportionally-sized, being large enough to suggest they are part of a fantastical or artistic representation while still fitting behind the woman's shoulders.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the months are displayed at the top of the wings. They are clearly legible and properly aligned with the design of the wings.
