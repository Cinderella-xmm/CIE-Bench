      "question": "Does the crystal cloche have smooth, continuous curvature with natural light refraction and no visible seams or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal cloche appears to have a smooth, continuous curvature, as evidenced by the even reflection of light across its surface, and there are no visible seams or jagged edges that break the flow of the curve. The light refraction looks natural, as it shows a slight distortion of the background—common in glass material—as would be expected in a cloche of such smooth curvature. Using world knowledge about the properties of glass and how it interacts with light, the reflection and absence of sharp edges suggest a high-quality, seamless construction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sapphire-colored shingles uniformly textured and do the gold details follow the roof’s architectural contours without appearing artificially painted or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shingles on the roof have a consistent texture and color, presenting a uniform appearance typical of detailed miniature crafting. The gold details along the roof align with the architectural lines of the structure, enhancing the contours without any visible signs of being artificially overlaid. This suggests a well-integrated design rather than a superficial addition. By drawing from world knowledge about architectural detailing, these elements appear to be part of a cohesive design rather than disconnected parts.",

      "question": "Do the flower beds at the entrance have natural plant textures, correct scale relative to the birdhouse, and sit flush with the ground surface without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flower beds in Image B showcase realistic plant textures that mimic the diversity found in real gardens. They are scaled appropriately relative to the birdhouse, maintaining proportionality. Moreover, these flower beds appear to be seated correctly on the ground surface, with no signs of floating or clipping into the base of the birdhouse. This indicates attention to scale and alignment in relation to the miniature environment.",

      "question": "Are the woodland creatures visible only through the window openings, positioned behind glass, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the grassy mound have natural undulations, consistent grass coverage, and a seamless transition to the birdhouse base without gaps or floating sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy area surrounding the birdhouse in Image B is depicted with realistic undulations, contributing to a natural terrain appearance. The grass coverage is uniform, and the transition between the grass and the birdhouse base is cohesive, displaying no visible gaps or indications of the base floating above the grass. This reflects an attention to creating a realistic and integrated landscape within the miniature setup.",

      "question": "Do all added elements (cloche, flowers, creatures, mound) respond to light consistently with the same direction and intensity as the original birdhouse and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the added elements such as the cloche and flowers demonstrate a consistent lighting response with the rest of the composition. The light directionality and intensity appear uniform across the original birdhouse and these elements, with consistent shading and highlights that match the ambient conditions portrayed. Without explicit presence of creatures identified or having direct illumination discrepancy, the elements harmonize under the depicted sunlight, indicating awareness of lighting conditions in the assembly.",
