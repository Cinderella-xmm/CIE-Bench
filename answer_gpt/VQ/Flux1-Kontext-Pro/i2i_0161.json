      "question": "Does the text \"Catch the Wave\" appear to blend naturally with the sky without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Catch the Wave' is superimposed onto the sky above the two surfers. The font is bold and white, which provides a good contrast against the blue sky without causing any noticeable artifacts or disruptions in texture. The use of a simple, clean font without shadows or complex effects likely helps in maintaining a natural blend with the background. World knowledge about design aesthetics suggests that a straightforward text overlay on a uniform background is less likely to introduce artifacts, supporting the observation that there are no noticeable texture issues.",

      "question": "Does the placement of \"Catch the Wave\" maintain the structural integrity of the horizon and waves, avoiding any visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Catch the Wave' text is positioned above the surfers and does not interfere with the horizon line or the waves below it. It's placed entirely within the open sky area and does not overlap with any complex elements like the waves or the horizon. This placement ensures that the text does not cause any visual distortion or break the continuity of the horizon. Observing the placement, it adheres to design principles that avoid disrupting key visual lines, such as the horizon, therefore maintaining structural integrity.",

      "question": "Is the \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note clearly legible and aligned naturally within the bottom-left sand area, without disrupting the beach's texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Summer Adventures – 2025' text is placed in the bottom-left corner, directly above the sand. The white font contrasts well with the darker areas of the sand, making it legible while the simple typography ensures that it doesn't disrupt the natural texture of the sand. World knowledge about optimal text placement suggests using high-contrast areas to improve readability without altering existing textures, which supports the observation that the typography seems naturally integrated with the sand.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do both the \"Catch the Wave\" text and \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note seem logically placed and contextually appropriate within the beach scene, contributing positively to the overall visual narrative?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In reviewing Image B, the text 'Catch the Wave' at the top enhances the scene's context of surfing and adventure, fitting well thematically with the image's setting of two surfers at the beach preparing for a surf session. The 'Summer Adventures – 2025' placed on the sand matches a common design choice for creating a poster-like invitation to a themed summer event. Text position and content both reinforce the idea of a summer beach outing, aligning with what is typically expected in visual storytelling or branding related to surfing and beach activities.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and light effects around the \"Catch the Wave\" text and \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note consistent with the lighting in the rest of the image, preserving the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in Image B, both 'Catch the Wave' and 'Summer Adventures – 2025', do not exhibit any additional shadows or light effects that would be inconsistent with the natural lighting in the scene. Their simple white fonts against their respective backgrounds (sky and sand) emphasize clarity without requiring extra effects that could disrupt the image’s ambient lighting. This approach aligns with the world knowledge that simplistic, clean designs often integrate more seamlessly into naturally lit environments, keeping the image's coherent appearance.",
