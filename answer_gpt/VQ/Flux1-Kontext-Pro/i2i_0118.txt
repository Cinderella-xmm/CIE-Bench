    "Question": "Q1: Does the character seamlessly integrate into the tablet screen without any visible gaps or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to be emerging from the tablet screen. The integration between the character and the screen is done by ensuring that the character's lower body seems to extend from the tablet, maintaining contact with the screen's borders.

This effect, combined with the 3D overlay of the character on top of the screen, suggests a thoughtful design to avoid unnatural transitions.",
