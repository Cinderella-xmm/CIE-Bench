    "Question": "Q3: Does the blue sash follow a smooth, gravity-consistent drape from the shoulder to the waist without unnatural creases or overlapping inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blue sash descends naturally over the figure's shoulder to the waist. The folds and flow appear consistent with how such sashes would behave, influenced by gravity, with a smooth drape and no obvious unnatural folds or overlaps. This analysis involves understanding how fabric behaves under gravity and its appearance in paintings or sculptures.",
