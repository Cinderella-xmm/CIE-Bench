    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the mannequin's body exhibit a consistent weathered stone texture throughout, without patches of remaining metallic sheen or abrupt material changes?",
    "explanation": "The mannequin's body in Image B consistently displays a weathered stone texture across its surface. There are no observable patches of metallic sheen or sudden material transitions, which indicates a uniform application of the stone texture. Typically, a weathered stone texture has a matte finish with natural variations, but here, the texture is uniformly present over the entire body of the mannequin.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral and paisley patterns on the saree clearly visible as raised carvings on the stone surface, maintaining their original shape, symmetry, and spatial arrangement without blurring or geometric deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral and paisley patterns on the saree are precisely carved into the stone surface. These designs retain their original shapes, symmetry, and spatial arrangement without any distortions, blurring, or deformations. The detailed carvings in stone allow these patterns to be elevated and maintain their intricacy as seen on the fabric in Image A.",

    "Question": "Q4: Are the necklace and bangle rendered as three-dimensional stone carvings with defined edges and depth, matching their original positions and proportions, and free from ghosting or misplaced elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace and bangle are converted to stone carvings with defined edges and sufficient depth. They match their original positions and proportions, similar to the jewelry seen in Image A, and there are no ghosting effects or misplaced elements in the transformation. This precise stone carving maintains the original design and placement of the accessories.",

    "Question": "Q5: Do the folds of the saree and contours of the body show subtle signs of weathering such as surface pitting, uneven texture, and shadowed crevices, without distorting the overall shape or creating artificial highlights?",
    "explanation": "The folds of the saree and contours of the body in Image B exhibit subtle signs of weathering, such as surface pitting, uneven texture, and natural shadowed crevices. These details enhance the realism of the stone appearance, yet the transformations preserve the overall shape and avoid artificial highlights.",
    "answer": "Yes"
