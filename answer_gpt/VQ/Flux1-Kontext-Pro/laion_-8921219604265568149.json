      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the façade of the cathedral is represented as a model with detailed textures that mimic the original stonework. The lighting and shading on the surfaces in Image B indicate careful craftsmanship to replicate the depth and intricacies of the original structure seen in Image A. The difference in appearance is due to the material but the effort to maintain a visually textured look is evident, thus it maintains a detailed appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figures are added in front of the cathedral, which suggests they are designed to be proportionally smaller and fitting for a diorama setup. The figures appear to be consistent with the scale of the cathedral model, as they do not look oversized or disproportionately small against the architectural elements, thereby maintaining natural positions and proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, being a diorama, does not show any direct illumination from miniature lamps that might typically emit light in a real-life scenario. The lighting in Image B appears to be more ambient, coming from an external source (probably the room's lighting). Since there is no specific indication of glowing lamps affecting the shadows, the setup remains consistent with the model's miniature nature.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display case fully integrated around the cathedral and square with clean, continuous edges and no intersecting or fragmented parts that disrupt the geometry of the original structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the cathedral inside a display case which is seamlessly surrounding the model. The edges of the display case are clean and well-integrated with the model architecture. The cathedral and square elements inside the case do not seem interrupted or misaligned, ensuring a coherent geometric presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the engraved plaque clearly visible, properly aligned, and styled with appropriate depth and lettering that matches the baroque aesthetic without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plaque on the display case is prominently featured with visible, aligned lettering. The depth and styling of the text on the plaque is consistent with what would be expected in a finely crafted engraved piece, reflecting a baroque aesthetic in its elegant presentation. This gives it a physical depth rather than a flat or digitally pasted appearance.",
