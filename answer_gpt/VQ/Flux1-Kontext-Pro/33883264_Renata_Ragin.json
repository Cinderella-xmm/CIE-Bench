    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed towers retain the original stone texture and structural lines, and are they shaped into arms without geometric distortion or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem's arms appear to have been transformed from towers, which maintain the typical stone texture and structural lines associated with such structures. The shaping into arms has been implemented without any evident geometric distortion or unnatural breaks, as the lines and features smoothly transition into the contours and joints of the arm structure, consistent with how towers typically appear. This indicates a thoughtful and skillful transformation process that retains the original characteristics of the towers.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suspension cables rendered as continuous, sinewy tendons with consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest area, without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suspension cables in Image B appear transformed into continuous sinewy structures that resemble tendons. They exhibit a consistent metallic texture, which is indicative of natural-looking cables, with smooth, natural curvature without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness, particularly around the chest area. This transformation preserves the original metallic aesthetics and provides a coherent appearance, seamlessly integrating the cables into the golem's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower transformed into a crown with clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally and are positioned directly above the golem’s head without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Freedom Tower is depicted as a crown with multiple facets resembling crystal surfaces atop the golem's head. These faceted surfaces reflect light naturally, maintaining a realistic appearance consistent with expectations for crystal-like structures. The crown is appropriately positioned above the golem's head without any visible floating or misalignment, aligning well with the visual impression of a crown adorned atop a figure's head.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers seamlessly integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers are transformed into the golem's body as armor plating. The integration appears seamless, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges among these skyscrapers. This transformation ensures that the armor plating retains the pristine appearance expected in an integrated design, thus maintaining the aesthetic flow and coherence of the body’s surface, akin to realistic armor.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the golem’s base fully anchored to the ground and water, with no floating or disconnected limbs, and does its overall scale match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the golem in Image B is depicted as solidly anchored to the ground and surrounding water, without any signs of floating or disconnected limbs, suggesting a stable footing. Furthermore, the scale of the golem is congruent with the surrounding skyscrapers and environment, providing a harmonious semblance that aligns with the golem being a prominent figure amidst the cityscape. This ensures that the transformation is believable and spatially coherent, matching the large scale of structures in a city setting.",
