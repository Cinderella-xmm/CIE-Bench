    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the sandpiper's body maintain correct proportions and natural posture, with wings aligned to the torso and legs positioned symmetrically beneath the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandpiper's illustration on the packaging shows the bird with a realistic body proportion and posture. The wings are aligned comfortably along the torso, and the legs are positioned symmetrically beneath the body, suggesting a natural stance typical for sandpipers. The posture appears balanced and anatomically correct for this species.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the packaging surface uniform in pattern and color, with no repeating tiles, sharp edges, or unnatural transitions between areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging surface in Image B shows a uniform texture and color scheme. There are no visible repeating tiles or sharp edges that disrupt the surface pattern. The transitions between areas on the packaging are smooth and consistent, which is typical for a well-designed product package.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the text \"Shoreline Explorer Set\" fully visible, correctly aligned, and rendered with smooth edges without jagged lines or transparency artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Shoreline Explorer Set' is actually missing and not visible. This indicates an absence rather than any issues with alignment or rendering. Therefore, analysis of alignment and edge smoothness is moot.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns on the flat bottom of the packaging form continuous, flowing curves without gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wave patterns shown on Image B are designed to flow elegantly along the bottom of the packaging with continuous curves. These curves mimic water waves and appear smooth with no gaps or overlaps, maintaining an aesthetically pleasing and natural design without angular distortions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the binocular-shaped cut-out window properly shaped with smooth contours, and does it show a clear, non-distorted view of internal kit components without floating or misplaced objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cut-out window, shaped like binoculars, displays smooth contours without irregularities. The view inside the window shows clear components, with no signs of distortion or objects being out of place. The clarity and positioning of components behind the cut-out suggest it is properly shaped and functional.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is there a smooth, continuous transition between the sandpiper illustration and the surrounding packaging elements, with no visible outlines, shadows, or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandpiper illustration on Image B integrates well with the packaging elements. There are no harsh outlines or shadow effects that disrupt the transition between the bird and its surrounding design elements. The colors also blend seamlessly, indicating high-quality integration and design work.",
