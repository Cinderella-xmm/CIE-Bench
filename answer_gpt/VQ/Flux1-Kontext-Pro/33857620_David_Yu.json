    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed roof retain its triangular silhouette with smooth, continuous edges and display detailed icy etchings that appear integrated into the surface rather than overlaid or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the roof on the structure is transformed to form the head of the fantastical creature, maintaining a triangular shape. The roof features intricate icy etchings that appear to be naturally part of the surface, suggesting they are integrated rather than merely overlaid. This integration gives the roof a cohesive appearance, aligning with the question's description.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the snow-covered areas transformed into wing-like forms that exhibit consistent translucency, subtle internal light diffusion, and seamless integration with the surrounding terrain without visible seams or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed wings have a translucent appearance with glowing internal lines, reminiscent of patterns found in wings with light diffusion properties. These wings are crafted in a manner that visually integrates with the overall creature composition and environment, avoiding any unnatural or disjointed appearance compared to Image A's snow patches, which show no such features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the rocky outcrops in the foreground and midground form leg-like structures with anatomically plausible proportions, smooth transitions between segments, and moss textures that match the surrounding environment without appearing pasted or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, structures akin to legs emerge from what were the rocky outcrops in Image A. These leg-like structures have smooth, continuous forms with realistic anatomy in the context of the creature. The moss textures continue from the surrounding terrain onto these forms, maintaining consistency in texture and appearance without visible distortion or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the stream display a uniform, low-intensity glow along its entire length that follows the natural flow path, without sudden bright spots, broken lines, or inconsistent illumination patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stream has been transformed to emit a soft glow along its course, with the light evenly distributed and following a natural flow without interruptions. This consistency avoids any abrupt changes in light intensity or irregular modifications, sustaining a continuous glowing effect unlike the non-glowing stream in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the fog layer distributed evenly across the upper mountain regions and seamlessly blended with the sky and terrain, preserving depth cues and avoiding abrupt transitions or unnatural cloud formations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a foggy atmosphere enveloping the upper mountain areas, which integrates smoothly with both the terrain and sky. This effect maintains the depth and atmospheric continuity, eschewing any sudden or sharp transitions that would disrupt the natural look found in Image A's fog.",
