    "Question": "Q1: Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle appears to be constructed from LEGO bricks. These bricks are typically uniform rectangles, which could create visible seams and misalignments when attempting to form a perfectly cylindrical shape. Given LEGO construction methods, maintaining seamless consistency in the cylindrical form is challenging, likely resulting in visible warping or misalignment. Therefore, observing Image B for consistent cylindrical form without warping implies a level of construction precision uncommon to LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are all brand text elements (e.g., 'BACARDÍ', 'MOJITO') and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
    "explanation": "Examining Image B's label composed of LEGO pieces, it is challenging to accurately align letters and logos using this type of material. LEGO bricks do not naturally lend themselves to smooth letter representation; thus, alignment and complete letter visibility on a label constructed from LEGO bricks is difficult to achieve. Due to these constraints from LEGO properties, distortion or missing characters can occur.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle cap appears to be constructed using LEGO bricks. LEGO bricks typically result in angularity and blocky structures instead of smooth, rounded shapes. Thus, achieving a cylinder with consistent height and diameter, coupled with a smooth rounded top free from angular breaks, is unlikely given LEGO's structural limitations. Image B's cap is likely to show some angularity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
    "explanation": "In analyzing Image B, the white shelf or surface appears beneath the LEGO bottle. LEGO constructions often have a leveled appearance due to their regular brick structure, lending to a horizontally aligned surface. Moreover, LEGO setups are typically neat and well-integrated into scenes, reducing the likelihood of irregular edges or floating segments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the smaller text elements such as 'natural mint flavor' and 'Simply pour over ice' fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
    "explanation": "For Image B, where smaller text elements are constructed using LEGO bricks, achieving full visibility and correct spacing without overlap or broken lettering is particularly difficult. LEGO's modular nature is not conducive to precise lettering that smaller text requires, thus increasing the chances of overlap or broken characters.",
    "answer": "No"
