    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the right-side skier maintain a natural texture and appearance without visible artifacts where he appears to slide out of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skier on the right appears to be in motion and the texture of his body, clothing, and equipment appears consistent with realistic skiing imagery. His appearance does not have visible artifacts which would cause unnatural distortions, suggesting that the texture has been preserved naturally during the editing process.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the right-side skier's body and equipment preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural bending in the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the skier's body shape and the equipment, including skis and poles, are not bent or distorted, indicating that the geometric proportions have been maintained well, even with the sliding effect applied.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shadow cast by the right-side skier remain consistent with the light source and appear naturally elongated or altered appropriately due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadow of the skier aligns with the direction of sunlight in the image, showing no inconsistencies or misplacement. It is elongated appropriately as one would expect due to the sliding effect and the angle of the sun.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow texture around the right-side skier smooth and uninterrupted, without showing signs of unnatural blending or disruption from the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow texture around the skier in Image B is smooth and consistent, without appearing distorted or showing any abrupt transitions. The movement effect does not interrupt the natural snow texture, suggesting an appropriate editing approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the details on the right-side skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis remain sharp and clear, without any blurring or loss of detail due to the sliding effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the details of the skier's clothing, ski poles, and skis are preserved with clarity. The editing does not result in any noticeable blurring or loss of detail, indicating a high level of preservation of fine details.",
