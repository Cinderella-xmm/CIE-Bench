      "question": "Are the swirling ocean wave patterns inside the crystal bottle smooth, continuous, and free of jagged edges or unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows a bottle with ocean wave patterns. Observing these patterns visually, they appear smooth and continuous, lacking any jagged edges or distortions. The artistry is fluid, indicating a careful design approach often utilized in premium artistic packaging where aesthetics are crucial. The waves curve naturally and flow inside the bottle, displaying no signs of abrupt interruptions or irregularities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden maritime symbols on the bottle label occupy the correct area, maintain sharp edges, and show no signs of pixelation or smudging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the golden maritime symbols, such as the compass, are visually distinct and occupy well-defined spaces on the bottle label. They have sharp edges and appear crisp, suggesting high-resolution design work. There is no visible pixelation or smudging, which would otherwise indicate lower quality or poor image editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the compass rose at the top of the packaging have evenly spaced metallic points with realistic reflections and no misalignment or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose on the packaging is depicted with evenly spaced metallic points and realistic reflections, characteristics typically expected in quality design. Observing closely, there are no misalignment issues or clipping artifacts, which would appear as visual errors, detracting from the professional appearance and suggesting oversight in editing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition from the bottle neck to the wave-patterned body seamless, with no abrupt breaks or geometric deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image reflects a smooth transition from the neck to the body of the bottle, which is adorned with wave patterns. This transition is critical in maintaining the bottle's aesthetic coherence, and any abrupt breaks or deformations would be noticeable and visually displeasing. However, the design in the edited image appears seamless and naturally flowing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parchment surface of the packaging display consistent aging texture without artificial streaks or uneven shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment on the edited image has a consistent aging texture, typical of vintage or artisanal craft aesthetics. This surface displays a uniform aged look without artificial streaks or uneven shading, which would otherwise indicate poor texture application or rushed design processes. Instead, it complements the premium appearance that high-quality designs often strive for.",
