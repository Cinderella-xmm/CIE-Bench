    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome have a smooth, seamless surface without visible seams, scratches, or unnatural distortions that disrupt the visual continuity of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears visually smooth and seamless, with no visible seams or scratches. The light reflection on the glass is natural, indicating a well-executed surface. This assessment is based on the way light interacts evenly with the glass surface, contributing to the continuity of the scene within the dome.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the sails exhibit layered, folded paper-like textures with consistent shadows and depth, without geometric distortions or flattened areas that deviate from their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sails on the ship appear to have detailed paper-like textures. The shadows and depth are consistent with the appearance of real folded sails. There are no visible geometric distortions or flattened areas, which supports the natural flow and structure typically expected in sail designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the blue resin layer below the ship show consistent translucency, internal glow, and wave-like patterns without abrupt transitions or unnatural textures at the hull interface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue resin layer below the ship is translucent, allowing for the visibility of wave-like patterns and an internal glow consistent throughout. The interface between the resin and the ship's hull is smooth, showing no abrupt transitions or unnatural textures. This consistency suggests careful attention to the resin's portrayal.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the seagulls connected by faint, straight wires that do not interfere with their natural flight positions or create visible mechanical supports?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, there are no visible wires connecting the seagulls. The birds appear to be suspended naturally, without visible mechanical supports disrupting their natural flight positions, confirming the absence of wires.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all elements (ship, sails, water, birds, sky) correctly positioned and scaled within the glass dome without clipping, overlapping, or misalignment that compromises structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the various elements such as the ship, sails, water, and birds are correctly positioned within the glass dome. Their scale and placement maintain structural coherence without any visible clipping, overlapping, or misalignment. This indicates that all components are well-integrated within the confines of the dome.",
