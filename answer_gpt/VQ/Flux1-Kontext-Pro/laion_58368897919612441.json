    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two towers and the central wall of the fortress proportionally reduced without distortion or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fortress, reduced in scale, sits inside a terrarium. Its architectural features, including towers, central wall, and structural elements, appear untouched and correctly proportioned, indicating no distortion. This demonstrates understanding of proportional scaling in model creation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss covering the ground exhibit natural texture and color gradients, resembling real moss rather than a uniform or painted surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss texture varies and includes gradients in color, mimicking real moss characteristics, suggesting use of simulated natural effects common in model landscaping. Such varied texture is key in enhancing realism in miniature landscapes.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the model knights positioned on the moss at a scale consistent with the miniature fortress, and do they rest fully on the ground without floating or intersecting with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model knights in Image B are proportionally scaled to match the fort's miniature size, standing firmly on the moss with no visible floating or intersection. Proper scale and positioning are crucial for coherent miniature displays.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the faux stone pathways extend from the fortress base onto the moss with consistent texture and alignment, matching the original stonework without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pathways in Image B seamlessly extend from the fortress base onto the moss, displaying consistent texture and alignment with the stonework, adhering to typical pathway layouts in miniature models.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass star transparent and reflective, positioned precisely at the top of the central tower's spire without overlapping or deforming the underlying structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass star appears transparent and reflective, placed atop the tower without altering the structure underneath, showcasing precision in model adornment and alignment.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the terrarium dome smoothly curved and transparent, enclosing the fortress without visible seams, warping, or optical distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terrarium dome in Image B is smoothly curved and transparent, enveloping the fortress without visible seams or distortion; typical features of quality glass domes used to enhance visibility while maintaining aesthetic integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wooden stand beneath the terrarium have visible wood grain, weathering, and design details consistent with vintage craftsmanship, and does it securely support the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden stand in Image B displays visible wood grain and detailed craftsmanship aligning with vintage design, and seems to securely hold the dome, reflecting accurate execution of traditional woodworking techniques.",
      "weight": 1,
