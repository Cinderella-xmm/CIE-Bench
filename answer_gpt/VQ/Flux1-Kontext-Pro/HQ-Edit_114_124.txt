    "Question": "Q3: Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of explorers are placed at the bottom of the scroll in the ocean area. They are small, proportional to the scale of the map, and do not overlap any crucial geographical labels. This positioning suggests a plausible representation of travel along historical exploration paths.",
