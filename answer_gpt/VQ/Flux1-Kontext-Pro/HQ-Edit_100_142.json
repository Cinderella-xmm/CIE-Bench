      "question": "Are the brushstrokes applied to the man’s clothing and headwrap consistent in direction and intensity, maintaining the pattern’s integrity without distorting the fabric’s shape or introducing pixelated or smudged textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstrokes are clearly applied in a consistent manner that follows the natural flow of the clothing and headwrap's patterns. The integrity of the patterns, including the vibrant colors and the design of the textiles, is well-maintained without any distortion. There's no evidence of pixelated or smudged textures that would disrupt the visual coherence of the fabric's shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the background blur smooth and uniform across the horizon, with no jagged edges, double contours, or inconsistent color patches that break the continuity of the landscape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is rendered in a stylized manner with swirling patterns that suggests movement, akin to a painting. However, this intentionally vivid styling does not feature jagged edges, double contours, or inconsistent color patches that would detract from the overall continuity of the landscape. The application is smooth, maintaining the artistic integrity of the landscape.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the drum retain its circular shape and consistent rim structure, with paint layers applied in a way that follows the curvature without flattening or stretching the surface unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the drum with a circular shape, and the paint layers are applied in a fluid manner that respects the drum's natural curvature. The rim structure is clear and consistent, and the application of colors during the editing process follows the drum's shape without causing any unnatural flattening or stretching of the surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the stylized grass and tree forms elongated or curved in a way that suggests motion but still preserve recognizable plant structures, such as upright trunks and branching patterns, without appearing fragmented or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass and trees are depicted with a dynamic, elongated stylization that creates a sense of motion. Despite this artistic treatment, the trees maintain recognizable structures, with upright trunks and branches, and the stylized representation of grass does not result in fragmentation or any floating appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display five distinct fingers with anatomically correct spacing and joint alignment, and are the fingers proportionally sized relative to the arms and drum without appearing stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image (Image B), both hands are visible with all five fingers distinct and displaying correct anatomical spacing and joint alignment. The fingers are proportionately sized in relation to the arms and the drum, and they do not appear to be unnaturally stretched or compressed.",
