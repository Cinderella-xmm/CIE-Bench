      "question": "Are the calligraphic strokes and ink washes on the central touchscreen visually coherent and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central touchscreen's visuals are transformed into an ink wash painting style, requiring evaluation of coherence. The brushstrokes should exhibit fluidity and cohesiveness characteristic of traditional ink paintings. Upon examining the image, the touchscreen displays with even, continuous strokes and soft ink transitions, avoiding broken or harsh lines, thus retaining artistic integrity without unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Does the wood paneling retain its structural consistency with bold brushwork, avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wood paneling should reflect its original form while integrating bold brushwork. The panel appears to maintain a smooth, consistent surface with defined lines that remain true to the panel shape. The brushwork accentuates the linear wood grain, suggesting deliberate strokes rather than random or broken shapes, preserving structural consistency.",

      "question": "Have the airflow graphics been seamlessly integrated into the calligraphic style without causing visual distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The airflow graphics on the touchscreen in Image B use an ink wash effect. Effective integration requires these graphics to blend naturally with surrounding visuals, maintaining clarity. In Image B, the graphics are clear; the ink wash style smoothly extends to depict airflow without distorting intended shapes, maintaining function and appearance seamlessly.",

      "question": "Does the integration of the ink wash painting style with the vehicle's interior maintain overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "An authentic and natural integration of ink wash style should honor the interior's form while enhancing it artistically. Image B balances stylization and form across the dashboard: the steering, panels, and screens exhibit soft ink tones, maintaining their recognizable form. Features like screens and buttons remain visible and functional in appearance, supporting overall authenticity.",

      "question": "Are the fine details of the vehicle's interior preserved, and are there no visible artifacts introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Preserving fine details ensures the interior elements are both recognizable and functional. In Image B, details like the steering wheel's texture, panel lines, and interface elements like buttons and icons are clearly defined in the painting style without unnecessary artifacts or blurring that could distract or reduce clarity, maintaining high detail fidelity.",
