    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
    "explanation": "The crystal sandcastle in Image B has uniformly shaped facets that are well-aligned with the tower geometry. The edges appear smooth and consistent, displaying a well-crafted symmetry. The clear, crystalline structure maintains the castle’s intricate design without any visible jagged or incomplete edges, which suggests careful artistic craftsmanship turned into glasswork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gemstones replicate the positions of the original seashells found in Image A fairly accurately, retaining similar spatial arrangements. The gemstones exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces and appear properly placed within the context of the sandcastle, consistent with the positions of the seashells. They do not seem to float above the surface unnaturally, suggesting careful design integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
    "explanation": "The frosted glass surface in Image B shows a wave pattern that appears continuous and flowing. There are no visible abrupt breaks or unnatural interruptions in the lines, which would signify a well-planned design intent capturing a smooth and uninterrupted aesthetic, as if mimicking natural waveforms.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
    "explanation": "The display case in Image B has visible and straight edges that frame the scene neatly. There is no observed clipping or warping of the elements inside the case, and the alignment with the perspective is consistent and coherent, suggesting a precise installation of the display within a museum-like setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldn’t be?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shovel is actually transformed into glass, matching its surroundings, but it maintains its shape and detail similar to its original form. The shovel appears undistorted and correctly positioned within the exhibit, lying flat without intersecting or inappropriate placement behind glass elements, aligning with museum display standards.",
    "answer": "No"
