    "Question": "Q1: Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are indeed covered in soft-looking fabric, which is evident from the texture that resembles a plush toy material. Each figure has a distinct bold pattern with non-repeating zigzag or wavy designs in blue, green, red, and yellow. The appearance is smooth and consistent, lacking any visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures, suggesting production as cohesive plush figures rather than any digital alteration or mishandling.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, each figure does not have traditional legs and arms. Instead, they have fins and tails that are in keeping with their plush fish forms. These body parts do not exhibit broken geometry or unnatural bends; instead, they seamlessly integrate with the body to maintain dynamic, playful poses typical of plush toys.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures possess no visible weapons at all. Their bodies have completely transformed into plush fish, each having features like fins and tails that are typical of fish. There are no elements that act as weapons, nor are there floating or misaligned components observed that would break the physical logic, emphasizing their transformation into harmless toy fish.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the figures on what appears to be a plush, textured surface resembling sandy fabric. The shadowing and detail in the backdrop suggest subtle shading and depth, creating a natural environment for the plush figures. They are positioned in a manner that seems physically plausible, with no floating or clipping issues perceptible.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are plush fish without recognizable features such as hands or fingers, given their complete transformation into fish-like forms. Therefore, the question of retaining a natural number of fingers does not apply as there are no hands to analyze in terms of digits or gripping positions.",
    "answer": "No"
