      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style Funko Pop figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's pose and attire without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style Funko Pop figure is designed with exaggerated proportions, typical of chibi figures, which have a larger head and smaller body compared to realistic human proportions. This design choice is standard for such figures and doesn't imply an unnatural distortion within the context of chibi-style collectibles. The baseball player's attire, including the helmet, gloves, and uniform, is consistent with this style. Understanding the stylized nature of chibi figures indicates that the proportions are intentional and fit within the art style of Funko Pop figures.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the detailed textures and lighting of the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box natural and consistent with the lighting and textures in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's textures and lighting appear smooth and consistent with the real-world lighting seen in Image A. The shading on the figure outside the box aligns well with the light source, and its placement does not suggest any inconsistency. The textures on the uniform and equipment (i.e., bat, gloves) seem cohesive with the principles of realistic lighting as used in photography.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is there an absence of unnatural textures or loss of fine details where the chibi-style figure transitions to the realistic depiction of the figure outside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the transition from the chibi-style Funko Pop figure to its realistic depiction is seamless without visible artifacts or texture inconsistencies. The details like the bat, uniform, and gloves are maintained well, keeping both the cartoonish aesthetic of the chibi figure and the detailed realism outside the box intact. This indicates a well-executed design where the style transition preserves necessary detail fidelity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the Funko Pop-style box and its elements (ball, glove, title) integrate naturally with the overall scene without disrupting the visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop box is presented with clear and visually consistent branding and artwork. Elements like the ball and glove are properly scaled and aligned inside the box, consistent with how such collectibles are typically packaged. The scene's integration of these elements into the overall visual composition appears natural, reinforcing its role in a commercial setting without disrupting the expected presentation style of Funko Pop products.",

      "question": "Does the isometric view of the Funko Pop-style box preserve the structural integrity and avoid any broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Funko Pop-style box is shown in an isometric view, which reveals its structure and design. The box exhibits clean lines and correct perspectives that align with typical box geometry. There are no apparent distortions or misalignments in the shapes forming the box, suggesting that its structural integrity is well-preserved without any broken or illogical geometry.",
