    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cat’s body exhibit a smooth, flowing mist-like texture with a consistent sky-blue hue that blends naturally without sharp edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is portrayed in a cloud-like manner with a mist-like texture. The body appears to present a consistent sky-blue hue similar to typical cloud illustrations, and the transitions appear smooth and flowing, without any sharp edges or pixelation typically found in digital artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the swirling cumulus cluster positioned atop the cat’s head in a way that follows natural cloud formation and integrates seamlessly with the head’s shape without appearing detached or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling cumulus cluster seems naturally placed atop the cat, like a seamless extension of the design with no apparent detachment. This suggests an intentional blend with typical cloud formations, leading to a natural integration with the cat’s overall design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the cloud patterns integrated into the cat’s body in a way that respects the original fur direction and does not cause visible distortion or unnatural layering over the striped pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no indication of fur but rather a cloud pattern replacing the fur. The cloud texture does not follow any fur direction as seen in traditional imagery but instead adopts a fluffy, cloud-like appearance typical for such illustrations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the translucent wings have a soft, ethereal appearance with subtle cloud swirls and are they attached to the cat’s body in a way that preserves anatomical plausibility and spatial consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B appear to be soft and ethereal, consistent with angelic or cloud-based designs. They are attached to the body in a manner that preserves spatial consistency, aligning with the overall mist-like, cloud theme for a cohesive appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the vapor trails and eye swirls smoothly rendered and aligned with the cat’s facial contours, avoiding jagged lines or misplaced streaks that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits vapor trails and swirling elements around the cat's head, rendered smoothly and adhering to the natural contours without noticeable artifacts. The swirls blend into the overall design, maintaining the cohesive and dream-like quality of cloud structures.",
