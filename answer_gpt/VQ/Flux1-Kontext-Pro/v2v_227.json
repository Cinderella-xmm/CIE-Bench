      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses artistic license to introduce playful touches, including exaggerated proportions typical in cartoon styles (like the large front wheel and simplified forms).

      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thick white outline in Image B is applied consistently around the entire sticker design. This outline separates the sticker's elements from the background, ensuring clear visibility. It does not interfere with the details of the elements inside, as evidenced by the sharp and distinct separation from the figure and vehicles.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular base in Image B utilizes a solid flat color, with the motorcycle and truck slightly extending beyond its perimeter, creating a dynamic and engaging visual effect. This design choice does not lead to any visual inconsistencies or compromise the clarity of the elements; rather, it draws attention to the central figures effectively, retaining the intended dynamics.",
