      "question": "Does the cartoon transformation of the baby elephant maintain natural proportions without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon version of the baby elephant is depicted with proportions typical of a cute, stylized animal figure. The head is relatively large compared to the body, which is common in cartoon depictions to make characters appear more adorable. The textures are smooth, matching a cartoon aesthetic without elements that seem distorted or unnatural. The cartoon character appears well-crafted and visually coherent.",

      "question": "Is the text \"First Splash!\" and \"Ele-Baby\" displayed with proper transparency, without obstructing underlying details or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'Ele-Baby' on the lower section. The text does not include 'First Splash!', suggesting there may have been either a misunderstanding or omission. Regardless, transparency is not an issue because the text is placed in a way that it does not obstruct any significant details of the image. The text appears clear and does not introduce visual artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the cartoon baby elephant uniformly rounded, consistent with the cute style and devoid of sharp or unnatural lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lines outlining the cartoon elephant are smooth and rounded, which fits a typical cute and stylized art form. There are no sharp or jagged lines that might disrupt the style, making the appearance congruent with cartoon aesthetics known for rounded and soft features to enhance visual appeal.",

      "question": "Does the cartoon baby elephant retain its original pose accurately, maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, both figures (the worker and the cartoon baby elephant) share a similar pose where they are standing upright with one arm by their side and the other raised. This retains structural coherence between the original and edited versions, preserving the credibility of the pose and contributing to the integrity of the transformation.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Ele-Baby' in Image B is positioned at the bottom right corner of the image. It is clear and legible, set against a non-intrusive background that ensures the text does not interfere with the visual presentation. The overall placement feels intentional and balanced within the image's composition, maintaining visual harmony.",
