      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the white studio background uniformly flat and free of shadows, texture mismatches, or visible edges where it meets the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is designed to be a clean, studio setting characterized by a flat white surface. Upon examination, the surface appears smooth, without any visible shadows, uneven texturing, or distinct edges where it connects with the toy, which suggests that the background material and lighting are skillfully managed to provide a seamless appearance. This is typical in professional product photography where the focus is on the subject, in this case, the toy. Image A features a dynamic beach setting, which is completely different from a studio setup, thus confirming Image B's intention for a clean and shadow-free backdrop.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the logo tag on the hippo’s ear properly aligned with the knit texture, showing realistic thread stitching and no unnatural color or shape distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the logo tag is on the hippo's ear. The logo appears accurately placed within the knit structure, maintaining realistic stitching that aligns perfectly with the knitted fabric it's attached to. This indicates attention to detail in texture and integration. The colors are consistent without any distortion, supporting the natural look expected from a well-crafted textile toy. In Image A, the tag alignment can be assumed to be comparable, but would often not involve such direct scrutiny, as the scene is less focused on these finer details.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the circular patch on the hippo’s side have consistent knit texture and thickness with the surrounding fabric, without raised or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the circular patch on the hippo’s side is examined for consistency in texture and thickness. The patch blends smoothly into the surrounding knit fabric, displaying uniform texture and integration without any visible anomalies like raised edges or a detached appearance. This contributes to the authenticity and quality presentation of the toy. Image A's playful setting on the beach does not draw attention to such minute elements and does not affect Image B's presentation.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned behind the toy at a natural distance, with consistent lighting and shadow alignment that matches the direction of light on the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box is positioned at the back of the toy, adhering to a logical placement that does not overpower or distort the toy's presentation. The lighting on the box and toy establish a harmonious setup, reflective of coherent studio lighting, ensuring shadows and light direction are suitably aligned. The natural placement and light integration are conducive to effective product photography. In Image A, the absence of the box detracts from any direct comparison but confirms Image B's intention for a clear product focus.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the plastic window on the box front transparent with subtle reflections and no distortion of the toy’s image visible through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plastic window on the box front is assessed for transparency and reflection quality. The plastic is clear with mild reflections, typical for packaging, presenting the toy’s image clearly without warping or distortion. This clarity is essential to ensure the toy's details are visible and maintain quality appeal through packaging. Since Image A lacks packaging, the analysis focuses solely on the details present in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the text elements clearly visible, correctly spaced, and rendered with smooth edges without jaggedness or overlapping with other objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s text elements on the box are evaluated for clarity and precision. They are readable, maintaining smooth, defined edges that showcase professional typography standards, free from any jaggedness or interference from other elements. This typographic excellence complements the overall presentation quality of the packaging. Image A, again lacking packaging, negates direct text comparison, thus reinforcing the standalone assessment of Image B.",
