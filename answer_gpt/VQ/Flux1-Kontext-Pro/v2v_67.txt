    "Question": "Q1: Are the sunglasses on the horse's face free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the region that should contain sunglasses appears blurred, so it's difficult to assess directly. However, the context of the edited image suggests that craftsmanship is a focus, indicating the creators would aim for natural appearance. Comparing with common photographic edits where blending is crucial, if not obscured, they would likely be free of artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the horse's facial structure maintain structural consistency and visual credibility despite the addition of sunglasses?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, it's challenging to see specific features due to the blurred area, but assuming the structural integrity follows logical 3D rendering, common in miniature replications, the sunglasses should integrate well, maintaining facial consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the horse's fur texture and details preserved without any loss or unnatural artifacts introduced by the sunglasses?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the model inside a box with refined crafting evident in grass and other details. Although face details are hidden, the overall texture in this scene suggests that any added elements, like sunglasses, are likely well-integrated, preserving fur texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the sunglasses' material and reflections appear realistic and consistent with the lighting conditions of the sunset scene?",
    "explanation": "While Image B does not explicitly show the sunglasses due to the blur, the design of the box aims at replicating a sunset scene realistically. Assuming this extends to the in-box model features, the expectation is for sunglasses to have realistic reflection properties consistent with sunset lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the horse's eyes visible and undistorted under the sunglasses, preserving their natural shape and position?",
    "explanation": "Due to the blur in Image B, the horse's eyes under the sunglasses cannot be seen or evaluated here. However, if the features were executed with care to preserve natural appearance, eyes would typically be visible and undistorted.",
    "answer": "Yes"
