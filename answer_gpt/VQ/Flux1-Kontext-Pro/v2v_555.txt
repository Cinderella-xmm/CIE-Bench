    "Question": "Q1: Does the snow globe surrounding the latte art appear structurally coherent without distorting the Colosseum and Big Ben designs?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe contains representations of both the Colosseum and Big Ben. The structural coherence of the snow globe means that these iconic structures should not appear distorted or altered in any way that detracts from their recognizability. The globe maintains a clear shape without warping these designs, suggesting that there's been a careful edit to fit the structures within the globe without distortion. Based on this analysis, it is concluded that there is no distortion in the representation of the Colosseum and Big Ben.",

    "Question": "Q5: Is the background of the edited image softly blurred with a cozy café atmosphere that complements the snow globe without introducing inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is suitably blurred, emulating a depth of field effect commonly used in photography to highlight the foreground subject—in this case, the snow globe. This blur adds to the cozy ambiance of a café setting, enhancing the focus on the globe while subtly indicating a warm environment. There are no noticeable inconsistencies that disrupt this compositional harmony, making the background effectively supportive of the primary snowy theme.",
