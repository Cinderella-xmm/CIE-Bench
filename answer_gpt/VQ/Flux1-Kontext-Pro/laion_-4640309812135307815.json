    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed bottle maintain the same elongated vertical silhouette as the original dress, with no compression or stretching of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottle maintains an elongated silhouette similar to the vertical flow of the original dress in Image A. The visual cues from the glass bottle align with the natural vertical length observed in the dress, exhibiting a preserved structure without notable compression or stretching. This seamless transition from fabric to glass respects the original silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the petal motifs clearly visible as raised embossments on the glass surface, with consistent depth and spacing matching the original dress's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bottle displays raised embossments resembling petal motifs visible on the glass surface. These designs reflect a consistency in depth and spacing, echoing but not perfectly matching, the petal placements in the dress in Image A. These design elements incorporate consistency in placement visible in the fabric without deviation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the cap shaped like a stylized red flower with natural petal curvature and symmetry, and does it sit properly on the bottle neck without floating or overlapping unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap in Image B possesses a stylized form resembling a red flower with petal-like curvature and symmetry. It sits correctly on the bottle neck and demonstrates realistic alignment, not exhibiting floating or unnatural overlap. This structured design mimics natural floral aesthetics visible in common object design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic label seamlessly attached to the glass surface with smooth edges, realistic reflection, and legible cursive text, without blurring, misalignment, or shadow mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, upon inspection, the metallic label is attached seamlessly to the bottle's glass surface. It embodies smooth edges, reflecting realistic highlights and shadows in this context. The cursive text on the label appears legible without evident blurring, shadow mismatch, or misalignment. This application maintains design coherence and realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the neck, body, and base of the bottle proportionally balanced and structurally sound, with no unnatural tapering or abrupt shape changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bottle in Image B demonstrates proportional balancing between the neck, body, and base. These sections connect fluidly, preventing any unnatural tapering or abrupt shape changes. This structured form ensures physical integrity, evidencing consistent transitions from each part of the bottle without noticeable disturbance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the boundary where the fabric dress transitions into the glass bottle, indicating poor blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inspecting the image, Image B does not exhibit visible seams, pixelation, or color bleeding at the transition boundary from fabric to glass, thus indicating a high fidelity blending process. The absence of graphical artifacts supports structural continuity from one material to another seamlessly.",
