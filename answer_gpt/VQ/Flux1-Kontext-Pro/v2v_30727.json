      "question": "Does the person appear naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is standing to the right of the zebra, partially visible from chest to foot. To assess whether the person is naturally integrated into the scene, we look for visual consistency in lighting, shadows, and depth compared to other elements in the image. Notably, the lighting on the person's clothing and skin appears consistent with the lighting conditions and direction seen on the zebra. The shadows cast by the person seem consistent with how shadows are cast by other objects in the image. The person's presence does not exhibit any obvious artifacts or discrepancies in texture that stand out as unnatural. Based on these observations, the person appears well-integrated into the scene.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's head turned in a way that looks natural and plausible for a startled reaction?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is facing downward towards the water, demonstrating a typical drinking position rather than a startle position. A startled zebra would likely have its head lifted swiftly and oriented differently, with possibly widened eyes and altered posture indicating alertness or sudden movement. The zebra's head position in Image B suggests relaxed engagement with drinking water rather than exhibiting characteristics of being startled.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's stripes clear and detailed without any unnatural blurring or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are visually intact and maintain their typical sharp, contrasting pattern. Evaluating clarity involves checking for sharpness, consistent texture, and absence of distortion across the stripes. The stripes' lines are well-defined and retain natural shapes without visible blurring or artifact around them. As the stripes are clear and detailed with natural appearance, we conclude that the zebra in Image B maintains stripe integrity.",

      "question": "Does the person's foot look like it is realistically pressing down on the zebra's tail without breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's foot is positioned near the zebra's tail, but careful visual examination reveals no direct interaction or pressing down. For realistic integration, the foot should maintain proper shape with respect to spatial relations and visible clues of pressure on the tail. Since there is no evidence of the person's foot pressing down on the tail, and the tail’s geomerty is continuous without distortion or deformation, this scenario is not applicable as described.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the person maintain the overall composition and layout of the scene without disrupting the natural setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing with Image A, which features only the zebra and its natural environment, Image B includes a person standing near the zebra. Placement and scale of the person in relation to existing scene elements are crucial. The person fits into the scene’s compositional balance without blocking or obscuring key features of the landscape. The continuity of environmental elements such as the zebra, rocks, and ground remains intact, accommodating the person’s addition smoothly. Overall, the person’s inclusion maintains the scene's harmony and coherence.",
