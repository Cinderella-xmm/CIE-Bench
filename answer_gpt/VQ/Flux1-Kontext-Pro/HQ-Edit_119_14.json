      "question": "Does the suit fabric display consistent texture and natural lighting without visible artifacts such as unnatural gloss or patchy areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit fabric in the edited image appears to have a consistent texture with appropriate lighting that matches the overall scene. The image has the appearance of a painted portrait, which inherently conveys a certain consistency in texture across the clothing.

      "question": "Is the top hat correctly scaled and positioned on the head, with the feather securely attached and casting a natural shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top hat in the edited image appears to be correctly scaled and suitably positioned on the head, aligned with the traditional depiction common in portrait paintings. The feather is securely attached to the hat, and both the hat and feather cast shadows consistent with the lighting direction, supporting the hat's position.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background fully integrated with the figure, showing no visible edges or mismatches in lighting or style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in the edited image is seamlessly integrated with the figure, consistent with the style of classical paintings where the subject and background share a uniform painterly quality. There are no visible edges or mismatches between the figure and the background in terms of lighting or style, suggesting a cohesive composition.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the trousers drape naturally over the legs with appropriate folds and creases, matching the figureâ€™s posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the upper body clothing is visible, the lower part where trousers would typically drape is not clearly visible in the edited image. Hence, the question does not directly apply as the image seems to be waist-up focused without visible trousers.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cravat and high collar appear properly aligned with the neck area in the edited image. Given the artistic and painted nature of the image, the alignment maintains a sense of proportion that aligns with traditional portrait stylings, without signs of deformation or misalignment.",
