      "question": "Is the explorer hat placed correctly on the sparrow’s head, matching its scale and shape without deforming the feathers or creating unnatural shadows or seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explorer hat on the sparrow’s head in Image B appears to be well-aligned and proportionate to the sparrow's head size. The hat fits neatly with the head without distorting the sparrow's natural features or creating awkward shadows, indicating a seamless integration. The sparrow’s feathers around the hat appear natural, without any visible seams or artificial shadows that would suggest an ill fit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the backpack appear attached to the sparrow’s back with proper alignment and proportion, showing no distortion of feathers or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the backpack is well-proportioned and aligned with the sparrow’s body. There is no visible distortion of the sparrow's feathers in the backpack area, indicating that it is integrated without affecting the natural lines and texture of the sparrow's back. The shading is consistent with the lighting of the scene, suggesting the backpack was thoughtfully placed.",

      "question": "Are the stylized map elements positioned where the original oak leaves were, maintaining similar shape and spatial relationship to the branch and bird, with no visible seams or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized map elements in Image B are positioned on the ground rather than replacing the oak leaves from Image A. The comparison shows that rather than changing the position of the oak leaves, the map serves as a ground plane that aligns well with the scene. This does not involve replacing leaves but a contextual placement of a map.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sparrow’s feathers retain their original fluffiness and layered texture, with consistent warm earthy tones that enhance but do not distort natural feather patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the sparrow maintains the feather's fluffiness and layered texture. The warm earthy tones are consistent and do not distort the natural appearance of the sparrow, providing a natural and lifelike representation of feather patterns. Thus, the feathers appear just as detailed and textured as in the original Image A.",

      "question": "Is the title text clearly visible at the top of the image, using a playful font with swirling elements that do not interfere with the bird or background, and free from distortion or blur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text in Image B is prominently displayed at the top in a playful font with swirling elements. It is clear and does not interfere with the central image of the sparrow or the background. The text is legible and lacks any blur or distortion, indicating a clean addition to the scene.",
