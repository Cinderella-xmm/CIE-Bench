      "question": "Does the brocade doublet on the man have consistent texture, visible pattern details, and natural fabric folds that conform to his body shape without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's brocade doublet appears to have a consistent texture, with visible pattern details that are characteristic of a historical or royal attire. The fabric of the doublet fits the man's body naturally, showing natural folds around the torso and arms, suggesting a well-designed garment. This observation leads to the conclusion that the brocade doublet conforms to the body shape without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the flowing skirt of the woman’s gown composed of layered, translucent fabric with natural ruffles and soft gradients, and do the jeweled accents appear embedded rather than pasted on?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s gown in Image B indeed presents a skirt with layered, translucent fabrics that create natural ruffles and soft gradients, indicating an elegant and flowing design.
