      "question": "Do the mechanical sentinels replacing the buses have intact geometric shapes, smooth surfaces, and consistent glowing blue underlights without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical sentinels are depicted as futuristic buses. They have consistent geometric shapes that resemble real double-decker buses, and their surfaces appear smooth. The underlights glow blue uniformly, and there are no visible rendering artifacts like pixelation or misalignment. This indicates a high level of rendering quality and attention to detail in maintaining the original shape of the bus.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the golden automaton version of Big Ben have uniform metallic texture, proper vertical alignment, and a centrally placed cosmic eye clockface without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Big Ben is transformed into a golden automaton. It maintains a uniform metallic texture, giving it a cohesive appearance. The alignment seems proper, maintaining the vertical positioning necessary for such a structure. The clockface is centrally placed and appears as a cosmic eye, with no visible distortion that would disrupt its circular symmetry.",

      "question": "Are the energetic vines wrapped around the Houses of Parliament following plausible growth patterns, maintaining consistent glow, and not intersecting through solid architectural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the vines are depicted as energetic entities wrapping around the Houses of Parliament. They follow seemingly organic but fantastical growth patterns that make sense given the surreal theme. The glow of the vines is consistent and does not flicker or have breaks. They appear to wrap around rather than through solid elements, maintaining the plausibility within the context of a fantastical image.",

      "question": "Are the airships in the sky properly scaled, positioned at a reasonable altitude, and displaying iridescent surfaces without harsh edges or shadow mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airships are depicted in the sky above the cityscape. They appear to be scaled appropriately, not too large or disproportionately small compared to the buildings. They are positioned at an altitude that is believable for airships within this fantastical scenario. The surfaces of the airships are iridescent, without harsh edges or visible shadow mismatches, aligning with the ambient lighting of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing elements (underlights, cosmic eye, vines, airships) blend with the ambient lighting of the scene without creating overly bright spots or unnatural contrast?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing elements in Image B, such as the underlights of the sentinels, the cosmic eye on Big Ben, the energetic vines, and the airships, all integrate into the ambient dusk lighting. There are no overly bright spots or harsh contrasts that undermine the unified aesthetic of the scene. The glow appears to emanate naturally, enhancing the atmosphere without disrupting the visual harmony.",
