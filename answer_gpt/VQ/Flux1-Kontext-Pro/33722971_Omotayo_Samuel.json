      "question": "Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a suitcase that has been edited to include a face resembling a 'chibi' style. This style typically involves exaggerated features such as large eyes and small mouths that are often superimposed onto objects for aesthetic appeal. The face appears to fit naturally along the curvature of the suitcase without any visible distortions or protrusions that would seem unnatural. The graphical execution seems to be deliberate to maintain the overall shape of the suitcase.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's hands have five fingers each with correct joint alignment. The positioning appears natural as the person’s hands are positioned inside the coat pockets, suggesting a relaxed pose. Overall, the figure appears anatomically correct with no visible deformities or missing limbs.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a display case with a velvet-looking interior. Observing the base on which the suitcases rest, the texture appears even without noticeable seams or repetitive patterns that could indicate poor editing. The lighting on the velvet surface respects the overall ambient lighting of the scene, with no unnatural reflections.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the display case seems to enclose all elements of the scene properly, with accurate proportions. There is no evidence of clipping of any elements within the case.
