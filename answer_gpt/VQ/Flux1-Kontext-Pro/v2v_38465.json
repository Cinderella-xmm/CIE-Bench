      "question": "Are the pandas holding the surfboards seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas appear to be well-integrated into the scene. Their fur and body contours align smoothly with the lighting coming from the sunset, which is a critical factor for seamless integration. The hands of the pandas grasp the surfboards naturally, without any visible cut lines or mismatched textures, indicating a successful digital composition.",

      "question": "Do the surfboards held by the pandas maintain their original shape and proportions without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfboards held by the pandas in Image B appear to retain their original shape and proportions, as seen in Image A. The boards are consistent in terms of proportions, maintaining the correct curvature and dimensions. The presence of details such as the fins and the overall silhouette of the boards remain unchanged, demonstrating that there has been no distortion.",

      "question": "Do the pandas' postures and positioning appear natural and consistent with the beach and sunset environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas stand in a position parallel to the surfboards, mimicking a natural stance as if waiting for the right moment to hit the waves. The lighting on their bodies corresponds with the direction of the sunset, enhancing the realistic integration into the environment. This positioning is consistent with how one would stand to admire a sunset, suggesting a natural and congruent composition.",

      "question": "Has the sunset and beach setting remained intact and visually credible without any alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the sunset and beach environment appears uninterrupted and consistent with Image A. The gradient colors of the sunset, the reflection on the water, and the texture of the sand remain coherent and realistic. There are no noticeable editing artifacts suggesting distortions or alterations to the natural scenery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pandas' sizes relative to the surfboards and the environment proportionally realistic and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pandas are approximately the same height as the surfboards they are holding, which is plausible as surfboards generally range from 5 to 9 feet. Pandas are large animals, so the scale seems appropriate when compared to the dimensions of typical surfboards and the environment. This proportionality reinforces the realistic nature of the edit.",
