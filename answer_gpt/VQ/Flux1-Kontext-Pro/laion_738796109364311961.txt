    "Question": "Q1: Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the player in red with muscular build that appears exaggerated yet aligns with normal human anatomy. The muscles are prominent but maintain a realistic shape and proportion, which is common in athletes, especially in sports like football.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the uniforms exhibit increased vibrancy; however, the colors are nuanced with gradient and texture visible under lighting conditions. The materials retain their natural fabric look, suggesting careful enhancement without oversaturation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The team logos in Image B are clearly visible and maintain integrity with clean lines and appropriate alignment, showing no signs of pixelation or distortion. This suggests a precision in preserving details through editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears sharper and more vibrant, yet it holds detail and coherence with the foreground elements like field markings and crowd. The enhancement does not introduce inconsistency or abrupt distortion between elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows both players in dynamic poses with exaggerated motion typical in athletic activities. The anatomical positions of limbs respect real-world biomechanics, providing a realistic depiction without suggesting unrealistic limb positioning or broken joint appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
    "explanation": "The box in Image B appears uniform in its matte texture and perspective, fitting around the image card accurately. The lighting is consistent, aiding in maintaining real-world harmony of materials without introducing noticeable artifacts or mismatched lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
