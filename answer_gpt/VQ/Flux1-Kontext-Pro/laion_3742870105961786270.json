    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the converted jug appear as a translucent glass stopper with visible reflections and refractions, and is it properly aligned with the bottle’s neck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stopper on the bottle is a translucent glass element that exhibits reflections and refractions typical of glass objects, indicating an appropriate material choice. It is accurately aligned with the neck of the bottle, suggesting careful integration.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the robe seamlessly transformed into a bottle shape with smooth contours, natural lighting gradients, and no visible tears or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a bottle where the robe is transformed extensively into a bottle shape. The contours of the bottle are smooth, and the gradients of lighting appear natural. There are no visible tears or geometric distortions, suggesting a skillful transformation approach.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the goose-shaped charm integrated into the base of the bottle with a visible connection point, and does it maintain proportional size and stylized but recognizable features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a grape-shaped charm is visibly attached to the base of the bottle, analogous to where the goose figure was located in Image A, maintaining a similar size and stylized features.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the grapevine engravings clearly defined, following the bottle’s contour, and free from jagged edges or inconsistent line thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows grapevine engravings on the bottle, which are clearly defined and follow the contour seamlessly. The lines are consistently smooth without jagged edges or variations in thickness, indicating proficient detail work.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the cardboard packaging fully enclosed around the bottle with clean edges, subtle shadows, and clear classical motifs without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cardboard packaging is behind the bottle rather than fully enclosing it. It has clean edges, classical motifs, and subtle shadows, but since it is not fully enclosing the bottle, it doesn't match the specified criteria.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the earthy tones and gold accents uniformly applied across all surfaces, with appropriate material-specific highlights and no abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, earthy tones and gold accents are applied uniformly across the bottle surface. The highlights are appropriate for the material, and there are no abrupt color shifts, suggesting a meticulous application process.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
