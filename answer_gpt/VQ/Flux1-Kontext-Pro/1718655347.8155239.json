      "question": "Are the golden threads on the moon evenly distributed and seamlessly integrated into the circular shape without visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon features golden thread embroidery that forms its shape. The threads are organized in a circular pattern, filling the space without apparent breaks or distortions. The uniform distribution of the threads ensures the moon's circular shape is maintained, and the integration appears smooth and intentional, suggesting an even and seamless thread application.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the interlocking geometric shapes on the mountain peaks align properly with the original ridge lines and maintain consistent scale and depth without floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountain peaks are represented with geometric embroidery forms that align with the original contours of the mountain in Image A. The geometric shapes maintain a consistent scale and depth, closely following the ridge lines to preserve the mountainous form. There are no visible floating or disconnected segments, indicating an alignment that respects the topographical features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the embroidery patterns on the red trees aligned with their original positions and shapes, and do they display consistent thread density and direction without visible flaws?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red trees are depicted using embroidery patterns that match the positions and shapes seen in Image A. The thread density and direction appear consistent across each tree, maintaining uniformity in their appearance. There are no visible flaws in the embroidery, and the trees retain their original arrangement and structure within the landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the silvery-blue silk strands follow the natural curvature of the water body and show smooth transitions between sections without abrupt changes in thickness or direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water body is represented by silvery-blue silk strands that mimic the fluidity and natural curvature seen in Image A. The transitions between sections are smooth, with no abrupt changes in thickness or direction, suggesting a careful correspondence to the flowing water. The silk strands are thoughtfully aligned to maintain the continuity of the water body's shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water all share a consistent artistic style and lighting response without creating visual dissonance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elements such as the golden-threaded moon, geometric mountains, embroidered trees, and silk-water are all created using embroidery techniques, lending them a consistent artistic style that melds well together. However, the perceived lighting response is coherent across these elements, complementing one another instead of clashing. Therefore, there is no visual dissonance; all components harmonize to create a unified piece.",
