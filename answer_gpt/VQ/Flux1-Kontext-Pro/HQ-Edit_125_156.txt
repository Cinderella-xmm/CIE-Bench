    "Question": "Q1: Is the magnifying glass placed among the books on the left bookshelf visually consistent in size, shape, and material, with a shadow extending toward the desk that matches the lighting direction from the window?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the magnifying glass is placed on the desk rather than on the left bookshelf. Its size, shape, and material look standard for a classical magnifying glass. The shadow logic is consistent with the lighting direction from the window, projecting towards the bottom left of the image. Given there is no magnifying glass on the bookshelf as described, the described scenario does not exist in Image B.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the ghostly outline of the detective in a trench coat appear as a translucent, softly blended form within the stained-glass window pattern, maintaining the integrity of the original design and showing no jagged edges or inconsistent opacity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the detective is clearly visible in front of the stained-glass window. The outline is not translucent or softly blended; rather, it is a defined shadow. The integrity of the original stained-glass design is largely preserved, and the shadow does not display jagged edges or inconsistent opacity; it has a smooth appearance consistent with a silhouette illuminated from behind.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the deep sepia tones applied consistently across all surfaces including the wooden desk, bookshelves, floor, and window, preserving fine details like wood grain and book spines without introducing blotchy or uneven color patches?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a consistent application of sepia tones across the wooden desk, bookshelves, floor, and window. These tones preserve fine details such as the wood grain and book spines, and there are no blotchy or uneven color patches visible. The lighting creates a warm atmosphere while maintaining detail in various objects' textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the title 'The Lost Legacy' positioned at the top of the image in a bold serif font that is clearly legible, proportionally scaled, and seamlessly overlaid without obscuring the ceiling details or causing visual disruption to the surrounding ornate patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Lost Legacy' is placed boldly at the top of the image. The serif font is clearly legible and proportionally scaled to occupy a central position without obscuring any significant ceiling details or ornate patterns. It blends well with the image, adding to its narrative without causing visual disturbance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the added elements—the magnifying glass and the ghostly figure—integrate seamlessly into the scene without distorting adjacent objects, altering lighting logic, or introducing visible artifacts such as misaligned edges or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "The magnifying glass on the desk is consistent with the image's lighting and texture, aligning well with the shadows cast in the scene. The ghostly figure, although not translucent, integrates into the image as a silhouette against the window without distorting the stained-glass pattern or adjacent objects. Overall, these elements are incorporated without visible artifacts or inconsistencies in lighting logic.",
    "answer": "Yes"
