      "question": "Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to be stepping out of the television screen, specifically with the lower part of the body crossing the screen boundary. Based on visual cues from Image B, the outline and textures along the screen's boundary look fairly seamless and do not display artifacts or abrupt edges. The transition from the TV screen into the real space is smooth and convincing. This suggests careful editing, maintaining natural textures and avoiding obvious signs of manipulation.",

      "question": "Is the shield held in a manner that complements the character's posture without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's shield is positioned naturally on the left arm, parallel to the character's body. The geometric shape of the shield is circular and undistorted, maintaining its integrity as it would in reality. The posture of the character supports this placement of the shield, showing that it complements the overall stance.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and reflections on the character's suit consistent with the environment, avoiding any loss of details or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's suit utilizes lighting and reflections that are not out of sync with the environment. The consistency of the lighting on the suit suggests awareness of the environment's light sources, such as the TV screen's glow and room lighting. The textures and details of the suit appear well-maintained without any peculiar anomalies.",

      "question": "Do the visible parts of the character’s body maintain proper proportions, avoiding distortion or unnatural scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted with proper body proportions. Arms, torso, and legs appear natural without signs of distortion. This suggests that the image edit preserved the character's dimensions as they should appear, ensuring the physical representation remains credible.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the character breaking out of the screen maintain the visual continuity of the background and avoid disrupting other elements in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the composition maintains the room’s visual continuity, even with the character seemingly stepping out of the screen. The character's presence does not disrupt the balance of the room's elements, such as the television and its placement on the cabinet. The use of perspective and alignment aids in preserving the scene's harmony.",
