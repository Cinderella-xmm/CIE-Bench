    "Question": "Q1: Are the geometric patterns on the dress preserved as continuous, non-distorted shapes without broken edges or misaligned tiles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dress features distinct geometric patterns that appear continuous and non-distorted. The shapes are clear and maintain their form without any visible broken edges or misalignment. Geometric patterns on clothing are typically intended to be seamless and continuous to maintain their visual appeal, and this image supports that design through consistent and precise pattern placement.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the necklaces appear as flat, transparent stained glass tiles with consistent color gradients and no jagged or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the necklaces are depicted with a beaded appearance, not as flat, transparent stained glass tiles. The necklaces have a three-dimensional, textured look typical of beaded or coiled jewelry, with consistent color throughout and smooth edges without pixelation or jaggedness. This is consistent with traditional beaded necklaces, contrasting the characteristics of stained glass, which would present a different visual form.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the individual braids still distinguishable and proportionally accurate, with smooth transitions between segments and no collapsed or fused strands?",
    "explanation": "Image B consistently shows distinct individual braids that maintain clear separation and proportionality. Each braid has smooth transitions from root to tip, and the segments are neither collapsed nor unnaturally fused. This is indicative of well-maintained hairstyles, suggesting attention to detail in the braid styling.",

    "Question": "Q4: Does the background display varied textures and elevation changes consistent with natural terrain, without uniform patches or unnatural color blending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background exhibits varied textures and elevation changes that are consistent with a natural desert or savanna terrain. The horizon and landscape features, such as hills and vegetation, present natural transitions with color variations that do not show uniform patches or unnatural blends. This accurately represents a realistic natural setting.",

    "Question": "Q5: Are the bracelets on both arms symmetrically positioned, correctly numbered, and free from distortion such as stretching or overlapping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the bracelets on both arms are symmetrically positioned with a consistent number that matches the style typically seen with traditional beaded bracelets. They maintain their form without noticeable distortion, stretching, or overlapping, which suggests that the image has aptly captured the intended symmetry and structural integrity of the jewelry.",
    "answer": "Yes"
