      "question": "Does the mirror-like surface in the foreground reflect the sky, trees, and Eiffel Tower with clear, undistorted imagery and smooth texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surface in the foreground appears to be a smooth area resembling a fountain or water body. The reflections include elements like the sky and surroundings. From the visual cues, the reflections seem slightly abstract, influenced by artistic style rather than photorealistic accuracy. Without clear or detailed reflections, one can infer the absence of clear, undistorted imagery. Hence, the answer is no.",

      "question": "Are the distant buildings and tree clusters positioned at distinct depth layers without overlapping or misaligned edges that suggest incorrect layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant buildings and trees appear positioned appropriately, with distinct layers illustrating depth. The separation between foreground elements like trees, mid-ground pathways, and background structures maintains a proper visual hierarchy. The absence of misaligned edges or obvious layer violations suggests a coherent perspective throughout the image. Thus, the answer is yes.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the small pedestrian figures on the pathways have consistent proportions, recognizable body parts, and smooth textures without visible deformities or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small figures in Image B appear as stylized silhouettes, which enhances their artistic integration rather than photorealistic representation. While clear body parts and detailed features aren't visible, their consistency in form and positioning implies intentional stylistic design. There aren't any visible deformities or clipping that affect image coherence. Considering the artistic style, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Is the dark frame with metallic edges present around the entire perimeter of the image, appearing solid and uniformly integrated without breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a dark frame surrounding the image, which looks solid and uniformly integrated. The absence of breaks or misalignment establishes continuity and ensures a cohesive visual presentation. The consistency and integration of the frame into the image presentation are clear, supporting a uniform appearance. Therefore, the answer is yes.",

      "question": "Are the engraved city names and coordinates along the frame legible, precisely aligned, and free from pixelation or uneven spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible engraved city names or coordinates along the frame. The absence of such text does not provide any visual data to analyze legibility, alignment, or pixelation issues. Hence any occurrence regarding these engravings cannot be substantiated. Therefore, the answer is no.",
