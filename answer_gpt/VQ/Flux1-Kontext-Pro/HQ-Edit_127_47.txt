    "Question": "Q1: Are the trees, mountains, and water inside the glass orb correctly proportioned and undistorted despite the spherical enclosure, with no visible warping or bending of vertical lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a scene encapsulated within a glass orb. The key elements – trees, mountains, and water – appear to be accurately proportioned without noticeable distortion, bending, or warping of vertical lines. This indicates an effective rendering that maintains realism despite the inherent curvature of the orb. The vertical lines remain straight and the natural perspective is preserved, suggesting a well-executed encapsulation of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ducks retain their natural body shape and size relative to the water and rocks, with smooth, reflective surfaces that do not show exaggerated shine or unnatural specular highlights?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ducks inside the orb maintain a consistent and natural body shape and size respective to the water and rocks. Their surfaces are smooth with appropriate reflection quality, ensuring no exaggerated shine or unnatural highlights disrupt the scene's realism. Their presentation complements the reflective properties expected within a glass orb setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the water beneath the ducks transparent enough to clearly see the rocky bottom, with no visible layering artifacts, texture tiling, or unnatural opacity variations?",
    "explanation": "The water in the glass orb (Image B) demonstrates a high level of transparency, allowing the viewer to see the rocky bottom beneath the ducks. There are no visible artifacts, texture tilings, or unnatural opacity variations that would detract from the visual clarity of the water. This transparency maintains the realism of the orb's distorted environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the miniature animal figurines positioned on solid surfaces, properly scaled compared to surrounding elements, and free from floating or unnatural shadows?",
    "explanation": "The miniature animal figurines are set on discernible solid surfaces, such as rocks, within Image B. Their scale is proportional to their surroundings and they don't appear to be floating. The shadows cast by these figurines seem natural and consistent, indicating realistic lighting interactions and positions relative to the surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the wood base have a natural grain pattern and cast a consistent shadow under the orb, indicating physical contact and realistic lighting interaction?",
    "explanation": "The wood base of the glass orb in Image B displays a natural and believable grain pattern. There is a consistent shadow present under the orb, which suggests proper physical contact and realistic lighting interaction. This shadowing indicates adherence to expected physical properties in real-world scenarios, enhancing the overall realism of the object.",
    "answer": "Yes"
