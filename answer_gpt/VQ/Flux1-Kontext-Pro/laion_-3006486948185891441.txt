    "Question": "Q1: Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horseâ€™s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent showcase box appears to correctly fit and encapsulate the horse sculpture. There are no noticeable distortions like warped edges or double images, which suggests that the box is properly aligned. The light refraction appears natural, matching what would be expected from a well-made transparent box. This assessment relies on the visual coherence and logical alignment observed in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
    "explanation": "The gold accents on the box in Image B exhibit a consistent color and reflective quality indicative of polished metal surfaces. There are no visible signs of unnatural highlights or color bleeding that would suggest inconsistency in the material's appearance. Reflections and gold sheens appear normal, suggesting a high-quality finish.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the brand logo clearly legible, properly centered on the black base stand, and free from pixelation or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The brand logo in Image B is visibly legible and properly centered on the black base stand. It does not show any signs of pixelation or blurring, indicating it is clear and crisp. This is assessed by observing the clear edges and readable text within the image, which are typically expected from high-quality print or digital images.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
    "explanation": "The internal backdrop pattern in Image B appears to follow the perspective of the box correctly. The patterns are appropriately aligned with the dimensions of the box, without visible warping, tiling errors, or cutoffs that would make them seem out of place. This conclusion is drawn from observing the consistent and logical alignment of the backdrop pattern within the context of the box's three-dimensional layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not specifically show any components or visual details indicating a magnetic closure mechanism. Hence, it is not possible to confirm its proper integration within the structure of the box without observing any visible gaps, overlaps, or floating components. The box seems to be a singular unit without apparent mechanism details.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are all visible parts of the horse sculpture (including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas) clearly preserved and unobscured by the added packaging elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse sculpture is enclosed within the box but remains unobscured by the packaging elements. The head, legs, saddle, and painted areas of the horse are clearly visible and preserved, despite the addition of the showcase box. This assessment is confirmed by the clear view of all these elements, indicating the packaging has been designed not to overlap or obscure the sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
