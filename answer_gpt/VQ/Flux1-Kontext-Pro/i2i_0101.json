      "question": "Is the text 'flyaway' added below the painting seamlessly integrated into the image without disrupting its authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'flyaway' is added below the painting on the wooden furniture. The font and style of 'flyaway' blend naturally with the decor, simulating a handwritten note that naturally fits into the scene. The position and scale do not detract from any element in the composition, and thus the text seems as intentionally placed as any other decor. This integration gives the feeling that it is a part of the entire setup, not feeling out of place or forced.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the handwriting of 'flyaway' appear natural and consistent with what one would expect on a postcard-style image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'flyaway' in Image B is rendered in a cursive, script-like font which is commonly seen in casual, handwritten-style notes, similar to calligraphy that could be found on a postcard. This style does not clash with the existing decor and complements the artistic nature depicted in the painting above, suggesting that it is fitting for an artistic or personal message setting.",

      "question": "Has the addition of 'flyaway' caused any visible artifacts or unnatural textures around the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no visible artifacts, awkward edges, or discrepancies in texture around the painting area or where the text 'flyaway' is placed. The smooth and consistent appearance implies that the text was added without causing any visual anomalies, maintaining the image's quality and realistic nature.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the text 'flyaway' maintain proper proportion and not cover any significant part of the painting or adjacent objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'flyaway' is proportionally scaled and positioned on the wooden surface under the painting. It does not overlay or obscure any part of the painting nor any significant features of the furniture or decor items, like the plant and vase. This careful placement ensures the functionality and aesthetic integrity of every component in the image is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image still visually coherent and balanced after adding the text 'flyaway'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Considering the elements in Image B, the text is positioned to align with and complement the pre-existing decor and furniture layout. The addition supports the overall aesthetic theme and does not introduce imbalance or clutter within the composition. It fits into the flow of the image naturally, confirming maintaining an overall balanced and coherent look.",
