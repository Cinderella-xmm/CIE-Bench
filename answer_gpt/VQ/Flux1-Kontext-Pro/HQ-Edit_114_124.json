    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the unfurled scroll form of the map maintain smooth, continuous curvature without jagged edges or distorted grid lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scroll appears to be unfurled at the top with a smooth, continuous curve. The grid lines of the map do not show any visible distortion, maintaining a clear and regular alignment, which ensures that the aesthetic of an unfurled scroll is preserved without jagged edges.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spokes of the ship's wheel evenly spaced, structurally intact, and consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the original compass material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a ship's wheel integrated with the compass. The spokes of the wheel are evenly spaced and appear to be consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the rest of the compass. This alignment maintains structural and visual consistency with the compass seen in Image A.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouettes of explorers are placed at the bottom of the scroll in the ocean area. They are small, proportional to the scale of the map, and do not overlap any crucial geographical labels. This positioning suggests a plausible representation of travel along historical exploration paths.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography aligned with the vintage aesthetic, free from pixelation or blurring, and positioned so that it does not obscure major elements such as the compass or continental outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in Image B is vintage in style, matching the aesthetic of the map. It is clear, without signs of pixelation or blurring, and is positioned at the top of the scroll. This placement ensures that major elements like the compass and continental outlines are not obscured.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, red dotted lines are visible on the map. They form continuous paths that do not overlap key symbols or cut through landmasses, suggesting an alignment with known historical exploration routes. This careful placement enhances the map's authenticity and readability.",
