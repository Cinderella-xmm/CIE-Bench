      "question": "Are the brush stroke patterns on the baseball bats consistent with the traditional Japanese Ukiyo-e style while preserving their original shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows baseball bats with brush strokes that resemble the traditional Ukiyo-e style. Ukiyo-e is known for its woodblock printing technique, which often illustrates objects with bold outlines and distinct textures. The bats in Image B maintain their original shape while adding a layer of stylization consistent with Ukiyo-e techniques. The surfaces have been depicted in a manner that emphasizes texture and gradation typical of this art style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass texture depict a Ukiyo-e style with natural brush strokes and without any unnatural or disjointed patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grass texture has been rendered in a style reminiscent of Ukiyo-e, where detail is conveyed through deliberate and flowing brush strokes. Unlike photorealistic shading, Ukiyo-e emphasizes patterns and stylized lines. There are no visible unnatural or disjointed patches; rather, the grass is depicted with consistent patterns that bring out a harmonious texture, characteristic of the Ukiyo-e style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and positions of the baseball bats relative to the grass maintain visual credibility and authenticity in the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Ukiyo-e, proportions and perspective may be stylized but should appear balanced and coherent. In Image B, the baseball bats are positioned and proportioned in a manner consistent with Ukiyo-e art, where there is harmony between foreground and background elements. The bats lie naturally on the grass, maintaining their position and size in a visually credible way.",

      "question": "Are the black grip handles on the baseball bats depicted with detailed Ukiyo-e brush strokes without visible distortion or loss of texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the black grip handles are depicted in a simplified manner typical of Ukiyo-e, focusing on form over texture. While they lack the photorealistic detail seen in Image A, the handles are represented with distinct outlines and sufficient detail to convey their form without unnecessary distortion. The stylization aligns with Ukiyo-e principles, which prioritize form and harmony over intricate detailing.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the interaction between the baseball bats and the grass depict a natural placement in the Ukiyo-e style without introducing structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Ukiyo-e emphasizes harmony and integration between elements of an artwork. In Image B, the baseball bats naturally interact with the grass in a manner that doesn't present visible inconsistencies or unnatural placement. This interaction follows the Ukiyo-e principle of creating a cohesive scene, where elements are balanced within the composition.",
