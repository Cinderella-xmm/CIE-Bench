      "question": "Is the teapot proportionally scaled down while maintaining its original shape, surface details, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot appears to be placed under a glass dome, suggesting a reduction in scale compared to its original depiction as a standalone object in Image A. The teapot in Image B retains its ornate design and intricate engravings, indicating its proportional scaling down without loss of detail. The shape, surface details, and general coherence of the teapot remain intact, affirming that the teapot is scaled down while preserving its original attributes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the porcelain cups arranged around the base in a balanced, non-overlapping manner, and do they appear to be made of realistic ceramic material with appropriate reflections and shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the porcelain cups are symmetrically placed around the base of the teapot within the glass dome. They are evenly spaced, and there is no overlap, allowing for a balanced arrangement. The surface of the cups shows subtle reflections and shadows, consistent with a ceramic material's light interaction, suggesting realism in material depiction.",

      "question": "Do the new engravings on the elevated surface match the existing decorative patterns in style and depth, without appearing pixelated, duplicated, or unnaturally enhanced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The elevated surface in Image B, where the teapot rests, displays engravings that are consistent in style and depth with other decorative elements on the teapot. These engravings match the ornate, intricate patterns found on the teapot. There are no signs of pixelation, duplication, or enhancements that make them appear unnatural, indicating a coherent integration with existing patterns.",

      "question": "Do the steam spirals rise smoothly from the teapotâ€™s spout and lid area, exhibiting soft edges, proper translucency, and consistent lighting interaction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, steam spirals are visible emerging from the teapot's spout and lid. These steam spirals are characterized by soft edges and a semi-transparent appearance, appropriate for how steam would interact with light. The lighting around the steam harmonizes with the ambient setting, displaying consistent light interaction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the glass dome show accurate light refraction and surface reflections, allowing clear visibility of the teapot and surrounding elements without visual distortion or artificial glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a glass dome encasing the teapot. The dome displays reflections and refractions typical of a glass surface, without introducing visual distortion that could obscure the teapot or cups. The visibility of internal elements remains clear, and there are no anomalies such as excessive glare or distortion, indicating accurate representation of light behavior through the glass.",
