      "question": "Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enchanted vines appear to be wrapping around the lattice structure of the Eiffel Tower in a continuous fashion. The vines follow the natural lines of the tower's iron framework, and there are no visible jagged edges or fluctuations in thickness that would suggest inconsistency. The integration of the vines with the tower's structure indicates careful alignment, enhancing the visual harmony between the artificial and the natural elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing floral motifs on the vines in Image B exhibit a soft, uniform emission of light. This glow seems to complement the warm tones of the surrounding sunset, creating a cohesive lighting scheme. There are no noticeable brightness spikes or sudden shifts in the intensity of the light, indicating that the highlights are carefully tuned to blend seamlessly with the ambient environment.",

      "question": "Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the stone platform at the base of the Eiffel Tower appears proportionally scaled to the structure's legs, maintaining a sense of balance and symmetry. The platform is centered and aligned with the base of the tower, ensuring no visual distortion or skewness. The details on the platform do not show any signs of warping, indicating an accurate representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arcane symbols on the stone platform are consistently spaced and maintain proper orientation. The depth perception and shadowing effects used give the impression that these symbols are carved into the stone surface, contributing to a three-dimensional appearance. The lighting and shadowing techniques enhance the illusion of depth, making the symbols appear embedded within the platform.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the towerâ€™s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The swirling nebulae depicted in Image B flow seamlessly from the base of the tower upwards, moving into the night sky. This effect creates a smooth transition that merges well with the orange gradient of the sunset. The nebulae display a cohesive flow with no evident sharp edges or abrupt breaks, contributing to a continuous visual narrative in the image.",

      "question": "Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal pinnacle depicted in Image B is characterized by distinct, reflective facets that effectively capture the sunlight. The detailing provides clear refractions, adding a dynamic and vibrant quality to the pinnacle. The facets maintain clarity and sharpness, with no visible blur or distortion, upholding the geometric integrity of the crystal structure.",
