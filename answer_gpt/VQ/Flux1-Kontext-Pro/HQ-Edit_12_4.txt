    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass dome enclosing the pocket watch and fabric exhibit clear, smooth transparency with realistic light refraction and reflection, without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome surrounding the pocket watch displays a smooth and clear shape, with light accurately reflecting and refracting on its surface. There is a visible reflection of a bright spot of light which is consistent with how a smooth glass surface would reflect ambient light. There are no noticeable distortions or jagged edges, which suggests careful attention to how glass surfaces interact with light.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the miniature leather-bound books and quill placed around the watch at a consistent scale relative to the pocket watch and fabric, and do they rest naturally on the surface without appearing suspended or distorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the leather-bound books and quill appear proportional in size compared to the pocket watch, suggesting a realistic scene composition. The books stand upright and follow a perspective in line with the tabletop setting, without appearing to float or be disproportionate. Similarly, the quill sits naturally on the surface, implying correct placement without any signs of distortion or suspension.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the leather-bound books display earthy and vibrant colors (such as deep browns, ochres, or burgundies) that harmonize with the original fabric tone, and is the golden embroidery on the fabric continuous, finely detailed, and free of artificial shine or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the books have rich, earthy colors such as deep browns and burgundies that complement the maroon fabric, maintaining a cohesive color palette. The intricate embroidery on the fabric appears continuous and detailed, without noticeable gaps or artificial shine, reflecting skilled craftsmanship and attentiveness to detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the pocket watch preserved with intact geometric form, visible engraved patterns, and consistent metallic reflections, showing no deformation or loss of fine detail due to integration into the new scene?",
    "explanation": "The pocket watch in Image B maintains its geometric integrity, with the distinct circular shape and detailed engravings clearly visible. The metallic surface of the watch displays consistent reflections, suggesting a realistic metallic texture and light behavior, with no signs of deformation or loss of fine detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the texture of the maroon fabric with red and gold embroidery consistently sharp and unbroken throughout, including under and around the glass dome, with no blurred areas, repeating patterns, or unnatural smoothing?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the texture of the maroon fabric, adorned with red and gold embroidery, is consistently sharp across different areas, including under and around the glass dome. There are no blurred sections or unnatural smoothing, and the pattern doesn't repeat unnecessarily, indicating careful attention to texture consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
