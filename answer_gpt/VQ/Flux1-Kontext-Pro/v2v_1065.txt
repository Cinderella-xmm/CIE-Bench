    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboarder is depicted inside a snow globe, maintaining a mid-action pose similar to a jump captured in motion. Due to the nature of the snow globe and chibi-style depiction, certain features may be slightly stylized or exaggerated. The skateboarder's limbs and skateboard maintain a realistic positioning and proportionality relative to their action, showing no obvious distortions or issues with physical rationality. This suggests the pose is preserved well within the constraints of such creative representation.", 
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a miniature scene inside the snow globe that mirrors the outdoor environment, complete with tiny palm trees and ramps. The integration of these elements is smooth, maintaining similar texture and geometries as they would appear in the original outdoor scene, without any signs of unnatural textures or broken shapes. The scene appears coherent and consistent with the intended miniature style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?",
    "explanation": "In the snow globe depicted in Image B, the skateboarder's clothing and skateboard maintain a high level of detail, mirroring the appearance of natural textures as expected for such items. The depiction of cloth wrinkles, texture on the skateboard, and the overall presentation of these elements suggest that attention to detail has been preserved, making them appear realistically detailed and natural.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B is depicted with attention to structural integrity and visual believability. The globe's glass surface reflects light, and there's light scattering from the window, enhancing its realism. The materials and reflections suggest a solid and well-crafted representation of such an object, aligning with expectations of a real snow globe.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?",
    "explanation": "Inside Image B, the falling snow within the snow globe is designed to look integrated into the miniature scene. The distribution and motion of snow particles are consistent with what one would expect from a snow globe, contributing to a lively and captivating atmosphere. The snow appears natural and appropriately placed within the scene, reinforcing the overall aesthetic without appearing artificial.",
    "answer": "Yes"
