    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the jagged wing structures formed from the mountain peaks have smooth transitions between rock and ice, and do they follow the natural slope and ridge lines without abrupt geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jagged wing structures are an artistic addition, drawing from the mountain peaks. These wings appear to have smooth transitions, resembling natural formations with lines that mimic the slopes of mountains. However, given the fictional appearance of the wings, there might be subtle geometric distortions unexpected in a natural landscape. Nonetheless, the wings seem to follow ridge-like patterns convincingly without abrupt distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scale-like patterns on the lake surface uniformly spaced and reflective, with no visible repetition, pixelation, or mismatched light reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lake in Image B displays scale-like patterns that seem evenly spaced and reflective, similar to natural water reflections. While assessing uniformity, these patterns appear smooth with consistent light reflections, showing neither visible pixelation nor repetitive pattern artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the peninsula resemble a continuous, tapering tail with natural curvature and surface texture, and are there no sudden breaks or unnatural bulges in its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The peninsula in Image B does not resemble a continuous, tapering tail as it has been edited to include a creature with wings and a tail that does not conform to a solid landmass. Therefore, the natural curvature and surface texture canâ€™t be assessed adequately in terms of a peninsula.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the house structures reshaped into a linear metallic spine that lies flat on the ground with consistent material shading and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the house structures were not transformed into anything resembling a linear metallic spine. The original elements on the ground remain recognizable. Therefore, the description of a metallic spine does not apply to any part of the edited image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the cloud eyes have clear, symmetrical pupil and iris structures, and are they seamlessly integrated into the existing cloud layer without visible borders or color discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not involve the transformation of clouds into eyes. The sky remains a part of the natural scenery with clouds appearing unaltered. Hence, any concept of cloud eyes with pupils and irises does not apply to this image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the grass fur consistently aligned in a single direction across the field, with natural-looking flow and no clumped or artificially drawn streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B appears to have fur-like texture extending over its body. While the fur in certain sections may seem natural, given the scale and fictional nature, it may not exhibit the consistent alignment typical in animation or real fur, possibly showing clumps or artificial appearance due to the added texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, duplicated textures, or lighting mismatches between the transformed elements (wings, scales, tail, spine, fur) and the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the existence of visible seams and discrepancies between the digitally created elements and the natural setting could stem from the unnatural addition of the creature. The complexity of digital artistry can sometimes lead to mismatches in lighting and textures that contrast with a natural environment, potentially causing visible signs of digital alteration.",
