      "question": "Are the added decorative patterns on the dhowâ€™s hull and deck aligned with the wood grain and structural lines, and do they lack jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative patterns on the dhow's hull and deck appear to be well-integrated with the wood grain and structural lines. This alignment is crucial for achieving a natural look and avoiding any visual discrepancies that may arise from misalignment. The patterns seem to flow with the wooden surfaces, exhibiting no jagged edges or unnatural textures, which suggests careful attention to design continuity and realism in the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the mythical sea creatures near the dhow have smooth contours, realistic scales or skin textures, and proper interaction with the water surface (e.g., ripples, reflections)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not depict any mythical sea creatures near the dhow. Instead, it shows a stylized dhow with an intricate design and does not include elements like sea creatures. Therefore, no analysis of contours, scales, or interaction with the water surface can be made based on the absence of such features in the image.",

      "question": "Are the blue and gold tones applied consistently across the scene without causing color bleeding, pixelation, or loss of detail in shaded areas of the boat and water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a vibrant use of blue and gold tones, reflecting a unified and consistent color scheme throughout the scene. The tones are applied smoothly across the sky, water, and dhow, without notable issues like color bleeding or pixelation. Shaded areas, such as those on the boat, maintain their details without appearing overly dark or washed out, indicating a high-quality rendering of colors and shadows.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the distant sailboats rendered as dark, simplified shapes that maintain their boat-like outline and do not merge into the sky or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant sailboats are presented as simple yet distinct dark shapes on the horizon. These shapes maintain the recognizable outline of sailboats, ensuring they are distinguishable from both the sky and the water. This clarity is crucial for preserving the depth and essence of the maritime scene, effectively preventing any visual blending that could obscure their forms.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the Arabian skyline mirage at the horizon rendered with a soft, shimmering effect that blends with the sky and water, and does it display geometric patterns without sharp edges or solid blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a depiction of an Arabian skyline at the horizon that is rendered with a soft, shimmering effect, creating a mirage-like appearance. This blending technique ensures a smooth transition into the sky and water without harsh lines or solid blocks, contributing to the mystical and dreamlike quality of the scene. The skyline's geometric patterns appear gentle and harmonious, enhancing the overall aesthetic without disrupting the visual flow.",
