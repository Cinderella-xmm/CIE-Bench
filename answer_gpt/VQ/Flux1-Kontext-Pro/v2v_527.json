      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the dog maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is represented in a LEGO style, characterized by its blocky and structured appearance typical of LEGO designs. This kind of representation allows for simplified and stylized forms that are consistent with the LEGO aesthetic, presumed to be intentional. The dog's body shape, positioning on the stop sign, and overall form align with this style, showing no signs of visual distortion or structural inconsistency.",

      "question": "Does the gradient shading used for the sky and clouds preserve their natural appearance and depth without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky and clouds are depicted with a smooth gradient and minimalistic design, consistent with the LEGO aesthetic background scenery. The gradient shading is simple but expected in such stylized designs, and there are no unusual artifacts or textures that would detract from the appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the LEGO-style stop sign retain its proper proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stop sign in Image B is designed to look like a LEGO piece, which means it retains a simplified, geometric structure. The proportions of the octagonal shape, as well as the lettering, seem consistent and appropriate for a LEGO-style piece, without any distortion or breakage in its geometric form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the base and nameplate free of unnatural textures and artifacts, maintaining a natural appearance and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base and nameplate in Image B appear to be smooth and in good proportion with the rest of the display. The nameplate text is clear and consistent with a plastic or metal plaque commonly used in LEGO exhibits, suggesting no unnatural textures or artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosure preserve its authenticity and natural appearance, without introducing any visual distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent enclosure resembles a glass or clear plastic display case, which is consistent with how items like this might be displayed. There are no visible distortions or artifacts that compromise the integrity or appearance of the transparent enclosure.",
