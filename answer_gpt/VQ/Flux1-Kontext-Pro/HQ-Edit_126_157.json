      "question": "Does the boat exhibit consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns and no repeating or unnatural surface artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boat shows a consistent aged wood texture with visible grain patterns that are typical of natural wood. There are no visible repeating patterns or artifacts that would suggest an unnatural surface. The representation of wood in art or craftsmanship often includes subtle irregularities that mimic real aging. Compared to Image A, where the boat is a part of a full-scale scene, Image B presents the boat within a wooden frame, showcasing an intricate detailing resembling an art piece or diorama.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the distant hills rendered with smooth pastel blue gradients that transition naturally without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the distant hills are part of a background that appears to be designed, possibly printed or hand-painted, maintaining a smooth pastel blue gradient. The transition between color gradients is smooth, without sharp boundaries or noticeable pixelation, suggesting a harmonious depiction. This reflects a realistic artistic interpretation of landscape drawings. When comparing with Image A, where the hills flow naturally as part of a photographed scene, Image B translates this into a crafted background behind a model.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there small, clear droplet-like etchings on the water surface that resemble ripples without disrupting the reflection or causing visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, droplet-like etchings are observed on the surface where water would be, suggesting a touch of artistic crafting to imply water interaction without interfering with any reflections. These etchings appear clear and delicate, adding texture without causing distortion. This could indicate an attempt to add a dynamic, yet subtle feature to the model scene. In Image A, actual water with potential reflections takes the stage, but in Image B these droplets are added as artistic accents.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a hand-carved wooden frame surrounding the scene with realistic texture, depth, and structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B distinctly features a hand-carved wooden frame encasing the scene, visible by its texture that implies woodworking skill. The depth among the frame's borders is consistent, demonstrating structural coherence which aligns with the characteristics of well-crafted display boxes or shadow boxes for art installations. This differs from Image A, where there is no visible frame as part of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the boat, water, and hills arranged in layered 3D cutouts with correct spatial depth and no misalignment or floating elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is composed as a 3D diorama, where each element like the boat, water, and hills are set as layered cutouts. These maintain correct spatial depth, giving an illusion of a landscape scene within a box, showing the craftsmanship precision to avoid misalignment or floating elements. This design choice reimagines a flat image from Image A into a tangible layered art piece.",
