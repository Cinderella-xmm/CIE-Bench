    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs of the figure have clearly defined joints and correct proportions, with no missing or extra limbs, and do the hands each have exactly five fingers arranged naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the figure's arms and legs appear to be correct, with clear joints that are typical for a doll. The hands are visible and appear to have five fingers each, arranged naturally without any abnormality. The visual information combined with world knowledge about dolls indicates that their construction often includes simplified joint structures but should maintain realistic proportions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the jacket and the stitching on the skirt preserved and aligned correctly, with no distorted or repeated textures, and does the fabric drape naturally over the doll's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pattern on the jacket is clearly visible and appears accurately printed without distortion. The stitching on the skirt is consistent and aligned correctly with no repeated textures. The fabric also drapes naturally over the form of the doll, displaying realism in how clothing might typically fit a doll, using smooth curves and folds.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lace trim around the collar thin and evenly applied, with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural shadows indicating poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lace trim around the collar to be thin and appears to be applied evenly. There are no visible gaps, misalignment, or shadows that would suggest poor integration. The lace uniformly follows the contours of the collar, which is characteristic of well-made doll costumes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the velvet hat properly sized relative to the head, with visible fabric texture and soft shadows that suggest it is resting on the head rather than floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat in Image B appears proportionate to the head, showing visible fabric texture typical of velvet. The soft shadows suggest it is resting naturally on the head rather than floating, which aligns with realistic doll attire where accessories complement and fit the dollâ€™s dimensions.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages in the background proportionally smaller than the doll and rendered with consistent textures and lighting that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements such as cobblestone street, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages are proportionally smaller compared to the doll, which is typical in scenes where the main figure is emphasized. The textures and lighting are consistent across these elements, suggesting they are part of the same scene environment.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the face have simplified features typical of a doll (such as painted eyes and smooth skin), and do the limbs show clear joint lines or hinges without unnatural bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the figure with simplified features typical of a doll, with painted eyes and smooth skin. The limbs display clear joint lines typical for doll construction and do not exhibit any unnatural bending or stretching, which is consistent with how dolls are designed for realistic articulation.",
