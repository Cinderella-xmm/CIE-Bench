      "question": "Do the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls accurately reflect the individual's attire and stance without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls resemble the individual's attire with pinkish tops and blue jeans, reflecting the same colors and design, which is consistent with the individual's image. The dolls follow a smaller, stylized form but maintain the integrity of these elements without any noticeable distortions or broken geometric shapes. The clothing and stance have been translated into a chibi form in a consistent manner.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls consistent with the original image's style, avoiding unnatural artifacts and loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style dolls in Image B exhibit a smooth texture typical of plastic or composite materials often used in dolls, which is consistent with their intended style. While they lack the detailed cloth texture present in the individual's attire in Image A due to stylistic simplification, this does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or significant loss of necessary detail, as they are meant to convey a simplified, cartoon-like representation.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table appear natural, with no visible artifacts or unnatural textures at the edges where they meet the table?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are placed on the wooden table without noticeable artifacts where they meet the surface. The shadows and lighting are coherent and match with the ambient light in the scene, ensuring a natural appearance. There is no evidence of unnatural textures or poor alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style Russian nesting dolls arranged neatly in a horizontal line on the wooden table, with appropriate spacing between them, ensuring structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style Russian nesting dolls in Image B are arranged in a visually coherent horizontal line across the wooden table. They are spaced evenly and follow a pattern typical of nesting dolls, with each successive doll gradually decreasing in size. This arrangement maintains structural consistency and aesthetic appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the edited image maintain an aspect ratio of 3:2, ensuring that the visual composition remains balanced and coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually appears consistent with common format dimensions and seems proportionally similar to Image A. Assuming Image A adheres to a 3:2 aspect ratio, Image B maintains balance and coherence in composition similar to Image A. There is no distortion indicating a change in aspect ratio, maintaining the intended proportional relationship.",
