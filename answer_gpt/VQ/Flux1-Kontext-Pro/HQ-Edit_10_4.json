      "question": "Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial area is meant to be evaluated based on its texture and proportions. Although the face is blurred, the rest of the image displays a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, suggesting that the intention for the face is similar. However, because of the blur, we cannot definitively assess the proportions and texture quality. Despite this, the other visible elements suggest that the intention was to maintain a consistent look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing rendered as deeply incised carvings with visible relief depth, and do they preserve the original arrangement of colors and shapes without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns on the clothing appear deeply incised and maintain a high degree of visible relief depth. The colors are vibrant and align well with the shapes, suggesting that the arrangement of colors and shapes is preserved without blurring or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the beads on the crown and earrings clearly defined with vibrant, non-blended colors, appearing as painted details on the wooden surface rather than merged or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beads on the crown and earrings in Image B are clearly defined with vibrant colors. They appear as painted details on the wooden surface with distinct lines and separation, rather than being merged or distorted, maintaining clear definition and vibrancy.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of low-relief carved plant forms that maintain spatial depth and botanical structure, without flattening or losing the sense of layered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears to be a carved wooden panel with low-relief plant forms. These forms maintain a sense of spatial depth and structure, with botanical details preserved effectively without flattening, giving an impression of layered vegetation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire sculpture surface display a consistent polished finish with no visible rendering artifacts, such as edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, or clothing carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface in Image B shows a polished finish throughout, with no visible rendering artifacts such as edge halos or texture repetition. There is a clear attention to detail in the hair, beads, and carvings on the clothing, ensuring consistency in the appearance of the sculpture.",
