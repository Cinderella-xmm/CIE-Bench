      "question": "Are the arms and face drawn on the pie’s surface consistent with the texture and color of the crust, without visible digital artifacts or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the entire surface of the pie does not show any distinguishing features like arms or a face. The crust texture and color across the pie's surface seem consistent, and no apparent digital artifacts or shading mismatches suggest alterations. Since there are no visible inconsistencies, and the pie in Image B appears primarily intact without such modifications. Therefore, I conclude that the pie surface is consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lattice pattern retain its original grid structure and spacing, and does it appear as a draped fabric apron without broken or stretched lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible draped fabric aprons replacing the lattice pattern. The main visual element is a pie with a lattice crust pattern, suggesting no transformation into an apron. The lattice structure and spacing are not visibly disrupted by any broken or stretched lines, maintaining its original design. Therefore, the lattice pattern remains consistent as the original pie lattice.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the knife converted into a feather pen with a realistic quill tip and wooden shaft, and does it maintain a natural transition from the original knife shape without abrupt edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knife depicted with the pie remains a knife, held by a character in the comic strip. There haven't been any adjustments to this component to convert it into a feather pen. The knife maintains its sharp edge and metallic appearance, with no attempt to create a quill tip or transition into a feather pen. Thus, the knife remains unchanged.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the additional pastries positioned at a consistent distance and scale relative to the main pie, and do they cast realistic shadows and reflect the same lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one pie visible, and additional pastries are not depicted nearby. The comic strip presents pastries on a plate, but their distance and scale relative to another main pie aren’t indicated. The focus is on the pie depicted in the comic, but there’s no overarching arrangement of multiple pastries indicating spatial relations. Therefore, the query does not apply.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the text bubbles positioned close to the pie’s mouth, legible, and free from overlapping or clipping with the pie or plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, text bubbles are used effectively as part of the comic strip. They are positioned above the characters’ heads rather than the pie itself, ensuring text legibility and avoiding interference with objects like the pie or plate. No overlapping or clipping is present with the pie or any other primary elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the hands on the pie have exactly five fingers each, proper joint alignment, and a natural grip on the feather pen without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pie shows no features resembling hands or a grip on a feather pen; it naturally remains a lattice pie without anthropomorphic attributes. The character in the comic holding a knife has ordinary hands, conforming to a standard depiction with no deformation or extra fingers, maintaining a natural grip. Hence, the scenario of hands on a pie does not occur.",
