      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the transformed object maintain a continuous, symmetrical egg-like shape with no visible breaks, jagged edges, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cup itself maintains an overall smooth and continuous structure. The base shape of the cup, while enhanced with decorative elements, retains a symmetrical form that is consistent throughout its body. There are no visible breaks or irregularities in the contour of the cup itself that disrupt the continuity of its shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the feather-like patterns seamlessly integrated into the surface, with consistent line thickness, shading, and color gradients matching the original level of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feather-like patterns on Image B are more elaborate than in typical designs. While Image A presents simple patterns, Image B features intricate feather details. In Image B, the feathers seem to be seamlessly integrated into the surface of the cup, with consistent line thickness and rich shading that enhance the detail and intricacy of the design. The color gradients appear smooth, matching the enhanced level of detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the wing-shaped handle smoothly connected to the body of the egg, with realistic feather layers and no visible gaps or distortions in its curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wing-shaped handle is designed to resemble a bird's wing, incorporating layers that simulate feathers. It is smoothly connected to the cup, and the feather layers appear realistic, with no visible gaps or distortions on the edges. This smoothness contributes to a cohesive appearance where the handle looks like an integral part of the design rather than an added feature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the nest-like rim have a layered, organic structure with consistent material texture and properly placed jewel accents that do not appear displaced or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rim of Image B features decorative accents that are reminiscent of jewels or embellishments. These are carefully integrated into the design, maintaining consistency with the cup's rich textures and patterns. The jewel accents are placed securely and do not appear to be floating or improperly aligned, contributing to an organic and cohesive presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glowing embers produce a subtle luminous effect that enhances the patterns without causing blurring, color bleeding, or unnatural highlights on adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing embers serve as embellishments that highlight the cup's design. They emit a soft, controlled glow that enhances the patterns without causing any noticeable blurring or color bleeding into adjacent areas. These luminescent elements are integrated in a way that they accentuate the details while maintaining clarity and sharpness of the surrounding artwork.",
