    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the knight's armor has a consistent metallic texture recognizable by its reflective and shiny nature, indicative of metal surfaces. There is no visual evidence of warping or unnatural smoothing; the armor retains a solid and realistic appearance, similar to traditional medieval knight armor designs. This consistency is crucial in maintaining the authenticity and detailed craftsmanship depicted in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome appears seamless and well-defined. The edges are clearly visible, and there are subtle visual cues such as reflections that suggest realistic light refraction, common in smooth, curved glass surfaces. The elements within the dome, including the knight, sheep, and turret, are fully enclosed without breaking through the dome, suggesting proper spatial management rather than digital clipping.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
    "explanation": "Image B showcases a shield with an embossed lion design that is intact. This design is characterized by a metallic sheen, providing depth through the use of light and shadow which is typical in depicting raised textures on metal objects. The detail remains fine, avoiding any flattening which would diminish the sculptural appearance of the lion on the shield.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sheep are shown at a size that is significantly smaller than the chibi knight, which aligns with realistic visual proportions given their depiction as miniatures. They have a wool texture that appears natural and soft, typical of sheep. Their forms are anatomically plausible for such stylized representations and are set on the grassy base without any floating or clipping issues.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the dragonâ€™s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon wraps neatly around the turret structure, maintaining a continuous body line without intersecting or visually slicing through the stone structure. The scaly texture is consistent, offering a believable depiction of dragon scales across its body without any visible deformations or gaps, maintaining design coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
