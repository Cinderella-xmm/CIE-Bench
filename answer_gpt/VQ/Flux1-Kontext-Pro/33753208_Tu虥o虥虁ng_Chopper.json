      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dragon’s body follow the exact winding route of the original dirt path from the foreground to the summit without altering its course or creating unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's body appears to follow the original path of the dirt road, but with additional natural curves and twists characteristic of a dragon's movement. In Image A, the dirt path follows a straightforward ascent up the hill without any additional curves. The addition of the dragon's body necessarily introduces some changes to the path's visual course due to the dragon's organic and dynamic form, which naturally bends and twists. Hence, the dragon’s course does alter the original path and does not follow it exactly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald and orange markings on the dragon’s body smoothly rendered with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or mismatched shading compared to the surrounding terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon's scales and markings are rendered smoothly, with harmonious shading and color transitions that match the surrounding vegetation, maintaining consistency in texture and detail. There is no visible pixelation or jagged edges that would indicate poor rendering quality. Additionally, the color blend of the emerald and orange with the terrain does not appear mismatched or out of place. Thus, the rendering quality is smoothly executed.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the twisting horns positioned at the dragon’s head near the summit aligned with the hill’s contour and free from clipping into nearby trees or appearing disconnected from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the dragon's head in Image B, the twisting horns are artistically aligned with the dragon's overall form and fit naturally against the landscape contours. They do not intersect or clip into any trees, and are well-positioned and integrated, appearing fully connected to the dragon’s body. The placement respects both the visual integrity of the dragon and the current environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the jade-colored eyes show realistic depth and reflection, and are they proportionally sized and positioned within the dragon’s head without appearing pasted or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jade-colored eyes of the dragon in Image B show depth and have a reflective quality that provides them with a lifelike appearance. They are proportionate to the dragon's head and fit within its facial structure, avoiding any effects that suggest they are pasted on or misaligned. The eyes are integrated naturally, contributing characteristically to the dragon’s expression.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the mossy tendrils extending from the dragon’s neck seamlessly integrated with the nearby vegetation, showing consistent texture and growth direction without sharp boundaries or unnatural clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mossy tendrils from the dragon’s neck are designed to complement the local vegetation. They appear naturally part of the environment, with textures and growth patterns that match the area's plant life. There are no stark boundaries indicating artificial placement or unusual clustering that could suggest disconnection with the surrounding flora.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the dragon’s head positioned at the correct elevation along the ridge, rising naturally from the hillside without appearing unnaturally elevated or detached from the body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dragon’s head is positioned at a natural elevation relative to the path and hillside. The head emerges in a continuous and harmonious way from the body, maintaining the illusion that the creature is part of the environment without appearing levitated or detached. The dragon's form respects the landscape's elevation.",
