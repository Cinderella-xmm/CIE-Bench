      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain's hairstyle does not feature any glasses. The hair texture is simplified due to the chibi design's nature, which emphasizes a cartoonish style. However, considering Image A (original image), where detailed hair texture is evident, the chibi simplifies textures as part of its stylistic approach. Given that glasses are absent, this distinction affects consistency with the original image.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi keychain of Image B, the scarf and wand are stylized as part of the overall cartoonish design. The scarf appears solid and the wand simplified, matching the simplified textures of other elements like the clothing and shoes, which are typical of chibi figures and maintain a consistent aesthetic within this style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure has a hand that is exaggerated compared to realistic proportions, which is typical of chibi style that emphasizes cuteness through disproportionate features, like a larger head and smaller body. This proportion aligns with the chibi aesthetic, making it plausible within this artistic style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chibi character as part of a keychain being held in a hand over a wooden background. There are no noticeable artifacts or shadows around the figure that disrupt integration into the background. The character appears naturally as part of the scene, likely due to capturing under consistent lighting and angle.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf and tie on the chibi figure in Image B are represented simply yet effectively to maintain the chibi aesthetic. Their simplified and exaggerated shapes work harmoniously within the design style, with no broken or distorted geometries evident, keeping a cohesive and appealing appearance in line with the intended aesthetic style.",
