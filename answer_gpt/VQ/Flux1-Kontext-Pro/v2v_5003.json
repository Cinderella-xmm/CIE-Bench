      "question": "Do the bow and quiver of arrows made from origami paper have a natural texture that blends well with the woodland setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bow and quiver of arrows appear to be made from traditional materials and not origami. The texture maintains the natural wood and leather appearance, which blends well with the woodland setting. This indicates that there hasn't been any conversion to origami paper materials, thus retaining their realistic appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the origami paper design on the bow and quiver of arrows preserved without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, both the bow and quiver maintain their original detailed textures resembling wood and leather rather than origami paper, meaning there hasn't been a transformation into origami. Therefore, there are no paper designs or artifacts present on these objects.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and shapes of the origami bow and quiver match their original forms without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions and shapes of the bow and quiver remain consistent with traditional designs, matching natural forms and dimensions rather than origami constructs. This absence of distorted or origami-like proportions indicates that they haven't been altered from their original forms.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the woodland backdrop unaffected and retains its natural appearance despite the conversion of the bow and quiver to origami paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B retains a natural and undisturbed woodland backdrop surrounding the bow and quiver, which continues to appear in their traditional materials rather than origami. Since no conversion to origami has occurred, the backdrop remains unaffected.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image, including the origami bow and quiver, maintain structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon reviewing Image B, the bow and quiver retain their original realistic appearance, with consistent proportions and undistorted forms. There hasn't been any conversion to origami, keeping the composition structurally credible and visually believable.",
