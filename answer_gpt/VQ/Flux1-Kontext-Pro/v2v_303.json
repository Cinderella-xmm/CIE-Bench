      "question": "Does the wavy background maintain its vibrant colors and fluid patterns without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a wavy pattern with vibrant colors that resemble a bokeh effect, creating a dynamic and fluid appearance. The lines appear smoothly integrated, indicating no visible distortions or artifacts. Comparing with Image A, the vibrancy and fluidity of the patterns are consistent across both images. World knowledge about digital image processing suggests that artifacts or distortions would appear as abrupt pixel changes or mismatches in patterns, which are not present here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the coat and scarf detailed and natural, avoiding any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the coat's fabric appears to have a smooth and slightly rough texture with visible stitching, consistent with a woolen or cashmere coat. The scarf shows a fine, delicate texture with a subtle pattern, suggesting a material like silk or fine wool. Both garments maintain detailed textures without any noticeable loss or introduction of artificial patterns. Comparison with Image A shows consistency in texture and detail, which implies that the editing did not adversely affect these elements.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the 3D-rendered elements and the original image components smooth, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the integration between the foreground and background elements appears seamless. The shadowing and lighting on the subject's attire are consistent with the ambient light implied by the wavy, luminous background. There are no visible edges or mismatches indicative of poor integration, suggesting a smooth transition between all components. The consistent visual language across both Image A and Image B supports this observation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical properties of the subject's face and body appear realistic and consistent with human anatomy, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the analysis of Image B, the subject's overall shape, including clothing fit and posture, appears consistent with realistic human proportions. The coat fits naturally over the shoulders, and the overall posture is typical of a standing position. Although the face is blurred, the body's proportions relative to the visible neck and shoulder region seem anatomically correct, aligning well with body measurements seen in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition and layout of the image visually credible, without any distracting or unnatural elements introduced by the editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B is balanced, with the subject positioned slightly off-center, creating a visually engaging scene. The consistent use of color and pattern in the background and the natural textures of the clothing ensure a cohesive look. There are no jarring or out-of-place elements suggesting tampering or poor editing. The visual integrity is maintained from Image A, reinforcing its credibility.",
