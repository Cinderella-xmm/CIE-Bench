      "question": "Does the statue's body maintain anatomically accurate proportions and joint alignment, with no bent or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue's proportions appear well-defined, with limbs and joints that have realistic proportion and alignment. The arms hang naturally and the hands and fingers are sculpted with attention to anatomical accuracy. No visible bending or elongation of limbs is evident, indicating that the proportions and alignments are as expected for a human figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold motifs and patterns on the saree clearly visible as engraved details on the marble surface, with no loss of fine lines or texture degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The saree on the statue is sculpted without any visible gold designs similar to those on a fabric saree. Since it is a marble statue, the engraving of intricate designs is minimal, focusing instead on the form itself rather than detailed patterns seen in fabric.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the statueâ€™s standing pose balanced and physically rational, with feet properly grounded and weight distributed naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The statue stands with a well-distributed weight over its feet, and the overall posture seems stable and balanced for a standing figure. The stance takes into account the center of gravity, which is vital for a statue to appear naturally balanced.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry appears to be a part of the marble sculpture itself, with details carved into or protruding slightly from the surface without any visible gaps. This integration avoids the appearance that the jewelry is separate and floating, maintaining the integrity of the marble medium.",

      ],
