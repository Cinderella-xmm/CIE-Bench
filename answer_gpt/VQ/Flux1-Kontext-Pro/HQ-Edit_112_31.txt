    "Question": "Q1: Is the horse’s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted as a plush toy. The head of the plush horse appears proportionally large relative to its body, which is a common characteristic of plush toys to enhance cuteness. Analyzing the facial features, the eyes and muzzle are large yet clear and consistent with the toy design, showing no signs of distortion. The large, expressive eyes are typical in plush toys, and the muzzle is rounded and smooth, maintaining a coherent toy-like appearance.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the body of the plush horse display a consistent fabric texture with soft, non-reflective surfaces and no abrupt transitions between color regions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse has a body made from material that appears to have a soft and consistent fabric texture, characteristic of plush toys. The surface is non-reflective, which is typical for such fabrics. The color transitions between the brown and white areas are smooth and gradual, aligning with the design of a plush toy and ensuring there are no abrupt changes.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes and mouth of the plush horse depicted with visible stitching patterns and raised texture consistent with embroidery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plush horse’s eyes are large and cartoonish, with a pronounced black pupil, but they do not feature visible stitching patterns. Instead, they appear to be smooth, typical of plush toy eyes made from plastic or glossy material. The mouth, designed with a simple line, also lacks visible embroidery texture. Therefore, while the design is consistent with plush toys, no visible stitching patterns suggest embroidery.",
