    "Question": "Q1: Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
    "explanation": "The metallic armor in Image B demonstrates a convincing metallic sheen. This is characterized by balanced light reflections that emphasize the natural contours and depth of the armor. The highlights and shadows are used appropriately, creating a realistic impression rather than a flat or overly shiny appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
    "explanation": "The armor in Image B is designed with joints that align well with the underlying anatomy, suggesting a thoughtful design that accommodates movement. There are no apparent geometric distortions or unnatural gaps that would suggest a disconnection between the armor and the body.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "The metallic hair strands in Image B appear smooth and continuous, mimicking the flow of natural hair. The strands exhibit consistent color gradients and reflective properties that highlight their metallic nature. There are no breaks or unnatural clumping observed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is a uniform, neutral gray tone, free from any remnants of a previous setting. The lighting is consistent across the background, ensuring no distractions or inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transitions between the armor, hair, and background are seamless, indicating careful editing. There are no visible artifacts such as pixelation or mismatched edges, which contributes to the overall polished look of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
