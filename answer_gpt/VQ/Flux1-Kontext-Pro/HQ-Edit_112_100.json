      "question": "Does the glass dome surrounding the eagle exhibit natural transparency, smooth curvature, and realistic light refraction without distorting the eagle or background clouds?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is visually analyzed to be clear, exhibiting characteristics of glass such as smooth curvature and appropriate light refraction. There are no visible distortions affecting the view of the eagle or the clouds inside the dome. This could infer that the dome maintains a natural transparency and realism, providing a clear view of the elements within.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds beneath the eagle’s wings three-dimensional, properly lit, and textured to match natural cloud formations without appearing artificial or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B appear to be three-dimensional and detailed, capturing the volumetric and texture qualities typical of natural clouds. The lighting and shadows add depth, meaning they're well-integrated under the eagle's wings. They do not look artificial or poorly placed, suggesting careful sculpting and alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the gold leaf detail on the miniature clouds applied in a way that shows fine, reflective metallic texture without disrupting the cloud’s natural appearance or creating harsh highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold leaf details on the clouds are assessed to be fine and metallic, reflecting light subtly without overwhelming the overall appearance or creating harsh contrasts. The integrity and natural texture of the clouds seem preserved, indicating a delicate and skillful application of the metallic material.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the dark wood base have natural wood texture, proper polish finish, and clearly engraved text, and is it positioned stably beneath the dome without appearing disconnected or disproportionately sized?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B appears to be crafted with a natural wood texture and a polished finish, giving it an elegant appearance. The text is clearly engraved, adding to its decorum. Its size and position under the dome are proportionate, ensuring stability and continuity with the rest of the composition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brass compass roses evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and rendered with realistic metallic texture and scale relative to the dome and base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass compass roses inside the dome of Image B are evenly distributed around the scene, maintaining a balanced aesthetic. They exhibit a correct shape and showcase a metallic texture that is consistent with real brass. Their scale is appropriate relative to the eagle, clouds, and the dome itself.",
