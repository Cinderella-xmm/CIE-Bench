      "question": "Is the outer surface of the globe smooth and uniformly curved without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer surface of the globe in Image B appears smooth and uniformly curved, as there are no visible jagged edges or distortions. The light reflections on the globe also suggest a smooth and continuous surface, indicating that it has been designed to appear perfectly spherical.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the miniature lighthouse inside the globe have accurate window placements and structural symmetry matching the original lighthouse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature lighthouse inside the globe in Image B has window placements and structural symmetry that mirror the original lighthouse seen in Image A. The windows and structural elements are proportionally placed and reflect the larger version, suggesting careful replication of the architectural details.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the waves made of translucent blue resin visually continuous with smooth surfaces and subtle internal reflections, showing no blocky or fragmented textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves within the globe in Image B appear visually continuous with smooth surfaces and exhibit subtle internal reflections. This gives them a realistic appearance, and there are no visible blocky or fragmented textures, indicating a smooth and coherent artistic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the wooden base flat and grounded beneath the globe, with visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B appears flat and grounded beneath the globe. The base displays visible wood grain and engraved lines that follow a consistent radial pattern, adding a touch of realism and craftsmanship to the presentation of the globe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the painted clouds and distant mountains located behind the globe, creating a sense of depth without overlapping or intersecting with the globe's surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the painted clouds and distant mountains are clearly positioned behind the globe, which helps establish a sense of depth in the composition. They do not overlap or intersect with the globe's surface, maintaining clarity and distinct layers in the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the rocks display earthy brown and green tones while the water shows vibrant blue with gradient shading, maintaining color harmony across the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks in Image B show earthy brown and green tones, while the water appears vibrant blue with gradient shading. This combination results in a harmonious color scheme that complements each element within the scene, consistent with natural aesthetic principles.",
