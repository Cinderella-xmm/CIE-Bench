    "Question": "Q1: Is the sun disc replacing the Sphinx’s head seamlessly integrated with the neck and body, showing no jagged edges or misaligned contours?",
    "explanation": "To assess the integration of the sun disc, we examine the transition between the disc and the body of the Sphinx. If the integration is seamless, there should be no visible jagged edges or misalignments where the disc meets the Sphinx's neck and body. The visual cues suggest a smooth merger between the sun disc and the neck, maintaining aesthetic continuity without apparent awkward transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Do the golden wings extend symmetrically from the sides of the Sphinx’s body with smooth, continuous surfaces and natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "The wings should emanate from the Sphinx's body symmetrically on both sides without any abrupt angles or irregularities in curvature. Upon inspection, both wings are mirrored in position, proportion, and curvature, maintaining a natural and balanced appearance. The surfaces appear smooth and continuous, indicating careful editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the sand flows on the limbs continuous and gravity-consistent, without abrupt breaks or floating segments?",
    "explanation": "For the sand flows to appear natural, they should align with the rules of gravity, following the contours of the limbs smoothly. The visual inspection of the sand reveals consistent flows conforming to the contours of the Sphinx's limbs, without any floating or broken segments, suggesting a coherent representation of gravity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the ankhs on the paws correctly shaped, properly scaled, and emitting a soft, localized glow without distorting adjacent textures?",
    "explanation": "The ankhs should maintain a proportionally accurate shape and size relative to the Sphinx's paws, with a glow that does not interfere with surrounding details. Inspection shows that the ankhs are well-proportioned and the emissive glow does not disrupt or alter the texture of the Sphinx's paws or surrounding areas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the entire edited figure exhibit consistent lighting and shading across all added elements, with no visible seams or texture mismatches?",
    "explanation": "Examining the overall image for consistency in lighting and shading involves analyzing how light and shadow interact across all elements. The elements, including the wings, ankhs, and sun disc, display a uniform light source direction and consistent shading that align with the scene's elements. This consistency indicates proper integration without noticeable seams or mismatches in the textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
