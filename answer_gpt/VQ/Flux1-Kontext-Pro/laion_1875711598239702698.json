      "question": "Are the body shapes of both elephants smoothly transformed into curved bottle forms without visible breaks or unnatural bends in their silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants are designed as perfume bottles. Each elephant has a smoothly curved shape, mimicking the form of elephants but with the added curvature typical of glass bottles. The silhouettes are clean and consistently rounded, suggesting a smooth transformation from the conceptual idea of an elephant to a bottle without visible breaks or unnatural bends. This reflects a seamless combination of artistic design and practicality.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the elephant ears appear as gold-trimmed bottle caps with smooth edges and no misalignment or deformation compared to the rest of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant ears do not serve as bottle caps. Instead, the caps are located on top of the elephants' backs. The ears are part of the elephant figurine itself and appear in the same design style as the rest of the sculpture. Therefore, since the ears are not bottle caps, this configuration does not apply.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glittering texture on the backs of the elephants replaced with a clear, evenly distributed glass mosaic pattern that reflects light naturally without artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants are covered with a glass mosaic pattern substituting the prior glittering texture. This mosaic is evenly distributed across the elephants' bodies. The mosaic pieces reflect light in a natural way, consistent with how light would interact with glass materials, creating a polished and artifact-free appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the brand logo and fragrance name label clearly visible along the trunks without stretching, warping, or overlapping with other features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephants have logos or labels visibly placed on them. However, there are no visible logos or labels along the trunks of the elephants. The rest of the elephants, including the trunks, appear smooth and undistorted by text or logos.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the gold trim, glass mosaic patterns, and bottle surfaces exhibit consistent lighting and reflection behavior that aligns with real-world material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold trim and glass mosaic elements on the elephants exhibit a realistic interaction with lighting, reflecting and refracting light as one would expect from real-world materials like gold and glass. The reflections and highlights are consistently and accurately portrayed across the surfaces, which supports the conclusion that they align with real-world properties.",
