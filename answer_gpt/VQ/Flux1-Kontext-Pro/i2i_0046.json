      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the details and textures of the skateboarder and the urban background preserved despite the application of the faded effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a faded effect is applied, which typically softens the colors and contrast. However, the skateboarder and the urban background remain distinguishable and detailed, with clear outlines and visible textures. Based on this analysis, the details are sufficiently preserved even with the faded look.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the white border and text \"11:13 AM\" blend naturally into the image without introducing any visual distractions or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white border and text '11:13 AM' are classic elements of a Polaroid-style photograph. In Image B, they are added to the bottom, maintaining consistency with how a typical Polaroid would look. The text is simple and legible, and the border does not intrude into the actual image content, ensuring a natural integration without visual distractions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the paper-like grain texture applied uniformly across the image without causing noticeable loss of detail or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B simulates a Polaroid print, which might include a grainy or textured look. This effect appears evenly applied, with no notable loss of image detail or unnatural patterns that would disrupt the viewer's perception of the skateboarder or background.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical relationships between the skateboarder, the skateboard, and the background elements remain consistent and logical after applying the Polaroid effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the added Polaroid effect, the main elements - the skateboarder, skateboard, and urban background - maintain their positions and proportions as expected from a real-world perspective. The editing does not alter these logical relationships, indicating consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the edges of the skateboarder and the skateboard smooth and free from any unnatural artifacts or distortions resulting from the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B shows smooth edges along the skateboarder and skateboard. Common artifacts from editing, like pixelation or blurring, are absent, indicating a clean application of effects without causing edge distortion.",
