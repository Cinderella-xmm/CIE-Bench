    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters are shown positioned with labels that resemble the process boxes from Image A, indicating the phases like Business Understanding and Deployment. However, the positions of these characters do not directly overlay the process boxes from Image A; instead, they are placed in a thematic outdoor setting that allows for some movement and spacing between labels. Thus, there is a shift, and the placements do not overlap neighboring elements directly as they do in Image A.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paths follow a more whimsical, natural setting rather than the structured circular path evident in Image A. While Image B maintains a thematic journey, it does not replicate the precise circular trajectory of the original diagram; hence, it does not follow a continuous, unbroken route.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central element is represented by glowing data crystals within a campfire, rather than a structured database depicted in Image A. The placement is central, balancing the image composition without overwhelming the surrounding characters, maintaining appropriate scaling.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles are presented as labels near each character, ensuring there is no overlap with characters or other scene elements. Despite some playful distortions in text, such as 'Modeling finas in Neat pades!', they maintain legibility and consistent font size.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters are depicted holding props like magnifying glasses and laptops in positions that are reasonable within the context of cartoon anatomy for animals. While stylized, the anatomical portrayal aligns with typical cartoon illustrations where props interact naturally with the characters.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays a consistent artistic style with uniform line art, shading, and color saturation across all elements including characters, paths, background, and text. The illustration maintains a coherent aesthetic without mismatched textures or abrupt stylistic variances.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the title banner located at the top edge of the image, fully visible, and not overlapping any part of the diagram or characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner 'THE ADVENTURES OF DATA JOURNEY!' is situated at the top of the image. It is fully visible and does not overlap with other elements, maintaining clear separation from the diagram and characters.",
