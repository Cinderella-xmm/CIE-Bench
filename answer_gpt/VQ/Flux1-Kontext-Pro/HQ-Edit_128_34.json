      "question": "Is the entire cityscape and car enclosed within a transparent, geometrically perfect cube with consistent refractive qualities that distort surrounding elements naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car and cityscape are enclosed within a transparent case. However, the shape is not a perfect cube; it appears to be a rectangular prism based on the visible dimensions. The transparency seems clear, but there's no evidence of complex refraction or distortion of elements that would indicate perfection in geometry or optical consistency naturally distorting the surroundings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the car's surface exhibit a uniform, high-quality metallic texture with natural reflections and no artifacts like blotches, smudges, or missing specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's surface is visually consistent, showing a high-quality metallic finish with reflections that appear natural and uninterrupted by noticeable artifacts such as blotches or smudges. The surface has a coherent reflective quality, indicating there are no missing highlights or texture inconsistencies.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers scaled down uniformly and proportionally without geometric distortions such as stretched windows, skewed angles, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the skyscrapers are clearly included in the enclosed scene, there is no visual indication of geometric distortions like stretched windows or skewed angles. Their proportions appear consistent with real-world dimensions without distortions, despite the miniature setting, suggesting adequacy in maintaining their geometric integrity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the windows of the skyscrapers display small, consistent, and physically plausible light points resembling micro LEDs without haloing, bleeding, or unnatural brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows no explicit light points like micro LEDs on the skyscraper windows. The windows appear uniformly reflective with no visible detailing that resembles individual light sources, thereby lacking features which might indicate micro LED presence. Thus, it doesn't match the description given in the question.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the trees feature finely detailed, dense green foliage with natural color variation and no pixelation or blocky rendering, indicating proper micro-scale modeling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, trees seem to have a consistency in texture and color that visually suggests a well-rendered density of foliage. There are no visible pixelation or blocky artifacts, indicating precise modeling suited to the miniature scale represented within the displayed setting.",
