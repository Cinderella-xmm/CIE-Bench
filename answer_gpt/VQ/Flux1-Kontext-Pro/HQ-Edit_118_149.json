      "question": "Are the pastel-colored areas of the dancer's leotard and tights smoothly blended without visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel colors of the dancer's leotard and tights appear smooth and homogeneous. The color transitions are natural with no visible lines or discolorations, suggesting a seamless combination of shades typical of good quality print or digital representation. There are no abrupt changes or visible artifacts that would disrupt the visual continuity of the clothing.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the detachable sections around the dancer’s leg maintain consistent thickness and alignment with the leg’s natural curvature, avoiding floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the detachable sections surrounding the dancer’s leg appear to maintain a consistent thickness throughout. The edges are aligned with the natural curvature of the leg, and there are no visual indicators of floating elements or misalignments that would distort the overall shape or create an impression of inconsistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stickers in Image B show the dancer's limbs in positions that are consistent with realistic and anatomically correct ballet poses. The joints and limbs maintain natural alignment without exaggerated bends, reflecting correct anatomical relationships typical of a dancer executing a high leg lift.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures cleanly integrated onto the journal surface, with shadows and lighting matching the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures are cleanly cut and placed onto the journal. The stickers are seamlessly integrated, with the appearance of appropriate shadows that align with the lighting source, suggesting an environment where the surfaces and figures coordinate harmoniously without disparity in illumination or shadow placement.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B closely, each of the dancer's hands retains five fingers, spaced proportionately in alignment with standard human anatomy. There are no indications of fused fingers or additional digits, maintaining the natural and expected finger structure.",
