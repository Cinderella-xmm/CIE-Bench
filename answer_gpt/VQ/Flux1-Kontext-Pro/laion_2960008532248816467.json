    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no eyes and smile are drawn on the yellow surface of the tart. The tart features the brand's stylized logo, just like in Image A. Therefore, the question is not directly applicable since there's no modification as described in the question. Given that the tart has maintained its original look, any analysis about the eyes and smile is not pertinent.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has two small, cartoonish creatures sitting on the crust rim of the tart. They are proportionally small and aligned with the curve of the crust. They sport soft textures and blend naturally into the scene, indicating careful editing without visible pixelation or artifacts. This suggests that they were deliberately designed to harmonize with the tart's features, ensuring natural integration.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a whimsical path can be seen extending from the base of the tart, seamlessly leading into a lush, animated forest. The path is smoothly integrated with consistent perspective and shading, contributing to a sense of continuity and flow without any abrupt edges or segments that appear to float unrealistically.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tart’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green foliage and pastel flowers are carefully positioned around the tart, creating a fantasy-like forest backdrop. These elements are placed at an aesthetically pleasing and realistic distance, with appropriate shadowing implemented to ensure they appear naturally part of the scene. There is no unwanted overlapping or clipping onto the tart, emphasizing precision in the editing process.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B only features one tart, unlike Image A, which had two. The single tart in Image B retains its original structure with no visible distortions, such as warped edges or missing layers. The tart’s presentation aligns in shape, size, and structure with Image A’s tart, evidencing that any edits made were nondestructive and intentionally focused on contextual embellishments in the surrounding environment rather than altering the tart directly.",
