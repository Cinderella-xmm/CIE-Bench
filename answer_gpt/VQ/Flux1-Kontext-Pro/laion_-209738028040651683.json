      "question": "Does the newly added pastel gown maintain consistent fabric texture and realistic layering without visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural creases?",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel gown displays a rich texture with lace and decorative trim that complement the design of the dress.
