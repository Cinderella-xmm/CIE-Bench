      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question specifically pertains to the face, which is blurred in both images, hence the observation cannot be accurately made beyond acknowledging the blur.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks and branches in the background are stylized according to traditional Japanese art, characterized by clean lines and broad brush strokes, which may not aim for realistic representation but maintain a coherent style indicative of natural shapes.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a stylized water surface that reflects the traditional art style rather than true realism, with simple color fills representing reflections without high detail, which remains coherent without distortion under this style.",
