      "question": "Does the surface of the piano exhibit a uniform caramel color with visible white and gold icing details that resemble real edible decoration, without unnatural textures or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano displays a consistent caramel color on its surface, with additional white and gold icing embellishments that closely mimic textures often found on edible items like gingerbread. The colors and decorative elements appear intentionally crafted to mimic an edible object, suggesting a high degree of attention paid towards aesthetic realism without signs of digital manipulation that would detract from this appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and spatial relationships of the piano’s components (lid, body, legs, pedals) preserved and correctly aligned, with no visible deformation or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the piano's components, including the lid, body, legs, and pedals, visibly maintain proportionate relationships similar to a standard grand piano design. Each element is aligned with expected symmetry and positioning, and there are no noticeable deformations which maintain the structural integrity of its form.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the color transition from black to caramel seamless, with soft gradients and natural light interaction that matches the lighting in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a black color transition; the piano is uniformly caramel, designed to appear as if crafted from edible materials. The lighting reflects off of this surface naturally, consistent with the light source position, adding soft highlights that corroborate the lighting style given by the room’s lighting. The question does not apply as there is no black color transition in the image.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the keys appear as distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard, with no missing or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keys on Image B’s piano appear individually distinct and are placed in a regular, orderly arrangement typical of any keyboard layout. There are no anomalies or gaps among them, thus providing a faultless continuity that mirrors an idealized and decorative model. The choice of describing them as sugar crystals is speculative, but they appear clean and uniformly organized.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white marble tabletop beneath the piano flat, properly scaled, and displaying natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble tabletop shows a flat plane surface with stone-like veining typical of marble patterns. It is scaled correctly in relation to the piano, and the shadows underneath the piano are consistent with expected light behavior, casting appropriate light and shadow based on the positioning of the light source. The light dynamics are realistic, adding to the visual authenticity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edges of the piano and its decorative elements sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The piano in Image B is shown with clear, sharp edges and well-defined decorative elements. There are no signs of pixelation, blurring, or abnormal blending that would typically indicate a lower-quality digital image or faulty post-processing, ensuring a refined presentation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the piano onto the marble table match the light direction from the chandelier and appear soft and naturally diffused?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, shadows fall naturally onto the marble surface, aligning seamlessly with the direction of the overhead lighting. The shadows are subtle and complemented by existing ambient lighting, creating a realistic softening effect common with diffused lighting conditions often created by chandeliers or similar fixtures.",
