    "Question": "Q2: Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "The ice cubes in Image B, depicted as 'eyes', show a level of translucency and cube-like form that is consistent with a cartoon representation. While cartoonish, their shapes are clearly defined, and they are placed in a manner that fits naturally within the overall composition of the glass filled with liquid, not defying any visual logic in terms of floating.",

While they lack detailed textures like woven straw or wood grain, which is normal for this art style, their scales are proportionate relative to the glass, and shadowing is applied consistently with the overall lighting direction of the image.",

However, they do not fully convey the impression of lying on a surface, as they are illustrated against a simple background. The overall visual balances the design without appearing disruptive.",
