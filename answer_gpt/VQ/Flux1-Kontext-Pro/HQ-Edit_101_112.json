      "question": "Does the kimono display consistent, non-distorted fabric folds with visible, harmonious pattern details that align with the woodblock print aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono displays harmonious pattern details typical of woodblock prints, following the traditional Japanese art style. The fabric folds are consistent and align with the aesthetic conventions of woodblock print art, characterized by clean lines and stylized patterns. My analysis is based on the observed visual style that fits the woodblock art form. Upon comparing with Image A, which shows more realistic fabric texture, Image B's patterns and folds are indeed consistent and suit the woodblock aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom petals in the air and on the ground evenly distributed with clear, non-overlapping edges and consistent size variation typical of stylized woodblock art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossom petals are evenly distributed in the scene, both in the air and on the ground. They maintain clear, non-overlapping edges and display a consistent size variation which aligns with the stylized nature of woodblock art. This uniformity in size and distribution is a characteristic trait in such artistic depictions. A comparison with Image A shows a more photorealistic depiction, while Image B's stylized approach is consistent with the woodblock aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the matte texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring facial features, fabric patterns, or the basketâ€™s weave structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The matte texture in Image B is applied uniformly across the entire image, giving it a consistent look that aligns with woodblock print style. It does not obscure fabric patterns or the basket's weave structure because the details are simplified as per the woodblock art style, rather than detailed like in Image A. The texture enhances the stylistic representation without causing loss of detail or obscuration based on the comparison.",

      "question": "Does the basket preserve its cylindrical shape and handle structure with visible, coherent weaving lines, even if simplified?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basket maintains a recognizable cylindrical shape and handle structure. The weaving lines are coherent and visible, albeit simplified, which fits the stylized nature of woodblock prints. By comparing with Image A, where the basket displays more intricate and realistic weaving, Image B simplifies yet retains essential structural elements consistent with woodblock print aesthetics.",

      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers per hand with natural joint alignment and no extra digits or unnatural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the hands shows five fingers per hand, and they exhibit natural joint alignment without any extra digits or unnatural curvature. The representation of hands follows the stylized yet anatomically correct portrayal often seen in woodblock art. Comparing with Image A, which also displays anatomically correct hands, Image B conforms to these principles, albeit in a stylized manner.",
