    "Question": "Q1: Are the color blocks applied across the shirtâ€™s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt features vibrant neon colors such as blue and pink. The colors blend in a way that suggests a psychedelic or tie-dye effect, with noticeable transitions and gradations between the hues. This design approach often embraces some degree of blending rather than using distinct, sharply defined blocks of color.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
    "explanation": "By examining Image B, the neon pattern is based on a complex illustration that centers on a figure with surrounding ornamental designs. While the core design is consistent, the intricate details of the illustration and the organic flow of the motifs exhibit some asymmetry, typical in artistic designs rather than mechanically replicated patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
    "explanation": "The central figure in Image B is depicted in a stylized manner consistent with artistic interpretations rather than strict anatomical realism. The limbs and torso, while muscular and stylized, don't exhibit exaggerated proportions or broken lines that defy physical plausibility given the stylized context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines are drawn in neon-colored detailing. These elements are well-defined and distinct, with no significant breaks or visual disruptions, allowing them to be clearly visible and contributing to the overall detailed aesthetic of the shirt.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The central figure in Image B is situated within an intricate circular frame with surrounding geometric patterns. The elements appear to be well-aligned within the context of the design. No significant distortions or misalignments are evident, indicating that the design maintains its intended balance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
