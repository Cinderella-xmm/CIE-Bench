      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the brown leather trench coat have consistent texture and natural folds that align with human body contours, and are the brass gears and mechanical details integrated without disrupting the coat's structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brown leather trench coat displays a texture that is characteristic of leather, with a sheen and subtle grain. The folds align with how a coat would naturally sit on the human body, draping and bending where expected. The brass gears and mechanical elements appear to be part of the design, harmoniously integrated without visible disruption to the coat’s form, lending a steampunk aesthetic. Thus, the texture and structural design align well with the human form without compromising integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the chronometer held in the right hand proportionally sized relative to the hand, with realistic shadows and reflections, and does it maintain a natural grip without distorted fingers or misplaced joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chronometer is adequately proportioned to fit within the palm and fingers of the hand, demonstrating an understanding of scale. The shadows cast by the hand and chronometer are realistic, enhancing the depth and dimensionality of the image. The fingers wrap around the chronometer naturally, without any apparent distortion or anatomical irregularities, which suggests careful attention to detail in maintaining an authentic grip.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the goggles positioned on the tricorne hat in a way that respects the hat’s structure, with no floating parts, unnatural shadows, or clipping errors between the goggles and the hat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the goggles rest on the tricorne hat in a manner that complements its form, following the curve of the hat without appearing detached or floating. The shadows cast by the goggles are consistent with lighting direction, preventing artificial shade issues. There are no clipping errors where the goggles abruptly merge into the hat, indicating a seamless integration respecting both elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the airships and floating cities in the background appear at appropriate distances, with consistent lighting and atmospheric perspective, and do they not overlap or obscure the subject unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the airships and floating cities are positioned at various distances, establishing depth in the image through size variation and perspective. The lighting across these elements matches the sunset scenario, accurately depicting shadows and highlights consistent with atmospheric haze. They are arranged without overlapping the main subject, preserving focus and avoiding unnatural obstruction. This placement contributes to a coherent composition, maintaining a sense of scale and distance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the leather coat, brass gears, and other materials free from unnatural repetition, blurring, or artificial edges, and do fine details such as stitching and rivets remain sharp and consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures for the leather coat exhibit a consistently organic feel without repetitive patterns or blur effects that would detract from realism. The brass gears retain sharpness and detail, enhancing their aesthetic. Fine details like stitching and rivets are crisp and show no signs of artificial edges or digital noise, indicating high-quality rendering and attention to detail.",
