    "Question": "Q1: Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elements that are present appear to retain their spherical and cubic shapes without being converted into rectangular LEGO-like forms. The shapes are smooth and rounded, indicating they haven't been modified into the characteristic straight-edged geometry of LEGO bricks. Therefore, they do not exhibit the transformation one would expect if they had been altered into LEGO pieces. This observation suggests the elements in Image B remain as marble spheres and cubes.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
    "explanation": "The surfaces of the elements in Image B show specular highlights and reflections that are inconsistent with the common matte finish of LEGO bricks. These highlights are indicative of a glossy or polished finish, resembling that of marble rather than the typical plastic surface of LEGO bricks. This observation leads to the conclusion that the surfaces do not match the intended look of LEGO material, which is generally not reflective.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the elements do not display any features typical of LEGO bricks, such as the interlocking studs or recesses required for bricks to connect with one another. The surfaces are smooth and continuous, lacking the protrusions and depressions needed for constructing with LEGO pieces. Without these features, the elements in the image cannot be considered as conforming to the standard LEGO design.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spherical and cubic elements are depicted on a wooden surface, similar to a shelf. While most appear to rest on this surface, there are small pieces that appear to be suspended or floating in mid-air, which do not align with the concept of a grounded and stable formation. Such floating pieces challenge conventional understanding of stability and gravity.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B consists of a wooden surface that provides clear texture and depth cues, which are neither simplified nor neutral. The wooden texture adds detail and complexity, thereby not conforming to a minimalist design which typically involves a lack of texture and detail. This environment contrasts against the idea of a simplified, neutral-toned background.",
    "answer": "No"
