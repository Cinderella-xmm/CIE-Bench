      "question": "Does the chibi figurine emerge from the Polaroid frame without any visible breaks or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Polaroid frame contains an image of a person wearing a yellow outfit and holding a tennis racket. The edges where the chibi figurine, which is essentially the person depicted in the Polaroid, interacts with the frame are smooth and properly aligned. There are no visible breaks or unnatural edges at the boundaries where the figure meets the frame, suggesting that the figure is well-integrated into the Polaroid.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi figurine consistent with its interaction with the Polaroid frame and the human hand, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The interaction between the chibi figurine (the person depicted in the Polaroid) and the Polaroid frame looks proportional. The proportions of the figure within the Polaroid appear logical and realistic in relation to the size of the hands holding it. There is no evident distortion or unrealistic scaling that disrupts the perception of consistent proportions.",

      "question": "Does the chibi figurine retain clear and natural textures, especially in areas like clothing and hair, without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the clothing and hair of the person within the Polaroid have maintained clear details. The textures in the yellow attire seem natural, and the intricacies in the depiction of the tennis racket and the hair are preserved well. This indicates a retention of clear and natural textures without significant loss of detail.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the yellow attire of the chibi figurine consistent in color and material with the original image, contributing to a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the individual's yellow attire appears to be consistent in color. The material and hue of the shirt seem to match closely in both instances, providing a coherent and natural appearance. This color consistency contributes to a smooth visual transition between the images.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph and the human hand holding it appear natural and structurally consistent, with no unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands holding the Polaroid are naturally positioned, and the Polaroid itself is structured without any obvious artifacts or distortions. The alignment and structural integrity of the Polaroid within the hands look realistic and anatomically correct, which gives the image a natural appearance.",
