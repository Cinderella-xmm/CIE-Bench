      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cat’s curled-up posture in the chibi illustration match the original position on the car hood and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is illustrated in a curled-up position, similar to Image A where it lies on the car hood. The chibi illustration retains the structural pose and curly nature of the cat from Image A, thereby keeping structural consistency.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gradient color blocks used to depict the cat’s fur smooth and free from unnatural textures or color blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the cat with gradient color blocks to represent its fur, ensuring consistency and smoothness without showing noticeable unnatural textures or color blocks. The texture is stylized, typical of a chibi style, which is intended to simplify the texture while maintaining an organic appearance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car appear as a curved surface with reflection lines only, maintaining its structural integrity and avoiding obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no depiction of the car itself, as the chibi illustration isolates the cat from the context. Therefore, no surfaces with reflection lines or structural integrity of the car are present for assessment in Image B.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sticker outlined with a thick white line and does it have a transparent background, retaining the visual coherence of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B clearly shows an outline around the cat, depicted with a thick white line typical for stickers, and the background appears neutral, suggesting transparency. This aids in differentiating the sticker from any other background context, providing visual coherence.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have any unnatural textures been introduced, or have key details of the cat and car been lost in the chibi illustration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B mostly simplifies the details of the original cat image from Image A by focusing solely on the cat and its pose without any indication of the car. Some texture details of the fur are stylized to fit a chibi illustration style, but it does not introduce unnatural textures that disrupt the visual integrity of the cat illustration.",
