    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the wing areas of the swan exhibit a consistent frosted glass texture that matches the lighting and translucency of the original ice material without visible seams or unnatural surface distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the swan has been completely transformed into a glass bottle, so there are no wings present to analyze in the edited image.",

      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the neck of the swan transformed into a glass stopper with a smooth, tapered shape that maintains proportional alignment with the body and does not exhibit unnatural bending, jagged edges, or volume inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the neck of the swan has been transformed into the stopper of the bottle. Visually, the stopper appears to be smooth and tapered, fitting well with the overall design of the bottle without any noticeable bending or inconsistencies. This transformation maintains proportional alignment with the bottle's body.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the red, pink, and green decorative elements (such as pine branches and flowers) integrated into the base of the bottle in a way that avoids floating or disconnected positioning, and do they maintain natural color and texture without blurring or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decorative elements at the base of the bottle, consisting of pine branches and flowers, are positioned naturally on the snowy surface. These elements appear integrated rather than floating or detached. The colors and textures are preserved well, showing no signs of blurring or pixelation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the \"Winter Glow\" text clearly visible, properly aligned with the bottle's curvature, and does the iridescent effect appear smooth and continuous without unnatural color fringes or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text \"Winter Glow\" is prominently displayed on the bottle, aligned with its curvature. The iridescent effect on the text is smooth and continuous, with no evident color fringes or digital artifacts, ensuring clarity and proper integration on the bottleâ€™s surface.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall shape of the transformed swan-bottle maintain structural coherence, with all parts proportionally aligned and without visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that break the continuity of the form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed swan-bottle retains a coherent structure. The bottle shape appears to be proportionally aligned, without any visible warping, stretching, or disjointed sections that disrupt the continuity of the form. The transformation from swan to bottle is smoothly executed.",
