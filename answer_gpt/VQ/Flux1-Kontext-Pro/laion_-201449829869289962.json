      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a dome glass case encompassing a scenery. The surface of the glass appears smooth and transparent. There is a realistic reflection which indicates correct light interaction and consistent texture. The edges of the dome are continuous without apparent stitching or warping, which aligns with a standard high-quality dome case. ",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church tower and the adjacent buildings appear to have been uniformly scaled down to fit within the dome. The proportions between the structures seem consistent, maintaining relative dimensions from a full-scale scene, which indicates careful reduction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the small houses have roofs, windows, and textures that match the architectural style of the church and its surroundings. The textures and architectural elements like windows and roof shapes are realistic and consistent with the original aesthetic, showing no signs of deformation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The church tower's copper roof in Image B displays characteristic variations in texture, including potential oxidation effects seen in patches of differing coloration, which real copper develops over time. The lighting also interacts realistically across the surface, showing natural reflection and shadow.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mist visible along the distant mountains in Image B shows a smooth diffusion. The transitions in opacity are gradual, consistent with how mist settles over landscapes in reality, without any sharp edges or pixelation that would indicate artificial processing errors.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold pedestal appears directly beneath the base of the dome, suggesting proper alignment. It provides apparent structural support, giving a stable and grounded look to the overall setting, with no parts appearing to float or misalign.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terraced vineyards in Image B are depicted with consistent spacing, resembling realistic agricultural patterns seen in hilly terrain. The curvature appears naturally smooth, indicating skilled digital rendering without grid lines or pixellation that would detract from realism.",
