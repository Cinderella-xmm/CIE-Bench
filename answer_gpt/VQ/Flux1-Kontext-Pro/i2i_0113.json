      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the character's face maintain its natural appearance and texture while integrated into the soft vinyl material without visible unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis process involves observing the integration of facial features with the vinyl material. In soft vinyl figures, achieving a natural face appearance requires careful sculpting and painting techniques to avoid artifacts. However, the face in Image B is blurred, preventing assessment of any potential artifacts or texture issues.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the character's body proportions and posture logically consistent and visually credible within the form of a soft vinyl figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a figure with proportions that align with typical stylized soft vinyl figures, displaying the exaggerated and simplified features inherent to this style, such as larger head and smaller limbs. The pose is upright and in-line with the display poses seen in collectible figures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the character's suit retained its detailed textures and material realism without introduction of unnatural artifacts in the soft vinyl figure design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that the suit carries over detailed textures such as leather seams and shiny surfaces that reflect light realistically. This preservation of detail is essential in maintaining realism in model figures, indicating no unnatural artifacts visible within the suit's design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the interchangeable accessories, such as weapons and hand gestures, integrate seamlessly with the figure's design without disrupting its structural consistency or introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display any interchangeable accessories or prominent hand gestures that could affect the structural consistency or introduce artifacts. The figure's design is continuous and smooth without disruptions, suggesting that any accessories or gestures present do not cause visual inconsistency.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character stand naturally on the black base without visible distortion or unnatural support, ensuring the figure's visual stability and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is positioned stably on the black base, typical for vinyl figures which are designed to stand independently. There are no visible distortions or support mechanisms disrupting the natural standing posture, ensuring the figure's visual stability.",
