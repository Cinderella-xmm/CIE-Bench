    "Question": "Q1: Does the Ancient Greek-style armor fit the characterâ€™s torso and limbs without distorting muscle contours or creating unnatural gaps or overlaps?",
    "explanation": "Observing Image B, the character in the first panel is wearing a cloth skirt typical of ancient Greek attire, rather than armor. The skirt fits the body naturally, following the natural muscle contours without causing unnatural gaps or overlaps. Combining this with world knowledge about ancient Greek attire, which was often designed to allow freedom of movement and display the human form, the attire appears to be appropriately fitted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the joints of the armored limbs articulated properly, and is the sword held in a position that does not bend or stretch the arm beyond natural limits?",
    "explanation": "In the second panel of Image B, the character is donned in medieval-style armor, holding a sword. The armor seems to possess articulation points at the knees, elbows, and shoulders, which are characteristic of functional armor designed to allow movement. The character's arms are positioned naturally, extending the sword forward without visible unnatural bending or overextension. Based on this analysis and understanding of medieval armor function, the joints appear properly articulated.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the barbell placed evenly across the shoulders with both hands gripping it in a balanced stance, and is the back posture upright and stable?",
    "explanation": "In the third panel of Image B, the character is depicted lifting a barbell. The barbell is visually centered across the shoulders, and each hand grips the bar firmly, indicating a balanced stance. The character's back exhibits an upright posture, suggesting stability. Applying common knowledge of weightlifting techniques which emphasize balance and upright posture, the depiction supports these principles.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the head proportionally aligned with the neck and upper torso in all three versions without appearing oversized, undersized, or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "Throughout Image B, each character maintains a head size that appears proportionally aligned with their respective neck and upper torso. The visual balance in each depiction is maintained without noticeable disproportion. Leveraging common principles of human anatomy which dictate proportional relations between head size and body frame, all characters uphold expected proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the hands in all three versions have exactly five fingers, proper joint curvature, and natural grip on the sword or barbell without distortion or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "Upon reviewing the hands of characters in Image B, each hand across all panels consistently exhibits five fingers, and is further characterized by natural joint curvature. The grips on the sword and barbell appear firm and realistic, without any distortions or additional fingers. Comparing these characteristics with standard human anatomy clarifies the correct depiction in all three instances.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the shadows and highlights on the armor, clothing, and props consistent with a single light source and do they enhance the three-dimensional appearance without creating floating or disconnected elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, shadows and highlights across the characters, armor, and props like the sword and barbell are consistent in suggesting a single light source. This lighting consistency gives a three-dimensional appearance to objects, avoiding any floating or disconnected visual elements. Considering artistic techniques used to render depth and form through light and shadow, the depiction effectively employs these methods.",
    "answer": "Yes"
