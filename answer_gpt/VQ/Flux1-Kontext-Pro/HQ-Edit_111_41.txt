    "Question": "Q1: Are the seat cushion's surfaces composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized LEGO brick layers with smooth gradients between them, maintaining a consistent black color without texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seat cushion appears smooth with no visible LEGO brick layers or texture artifacts. It maintains a consistent black color, but the absence of LEGO-like characteristics indicates that the cushion is not composed of LEGO bricks. This analysis is based on the observation of the chair's surface, which appears more like a typical chair fabric than LEGO bricks.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the backrest consist of evenly spaced, horizontally aligned LEGO brick layers that follow the original contour without gaps, misalignments, or irregular spacing?",
    "explanation": "The backrest in Image B is composed of segments aligned horizontally, creating a smooth contour. However, these segments do not resemble LEGO brick layers. They do not have the characteristic LEGO stud appearance, and the surface seems continuous and smooth rather than segmented by brick edges with gaps or irregular spacing.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the armrests rendered as simple hinged LEGO pieces with clean edges and uniform silver finish, preserving their original curvature and connection points without distortion?",
    "explanation": "The armrests in Image B retain their original design with a consistent silver finish and maintains smooth, clean edges. However, they do not show any characteristics of LEGO pieces, such as hinges or visible connection points distinctive to LEGO. The edges do not have studs or detailing commonly associated with LEGO that might otherwise indicate a transformation into LEGO form.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are all five wheels made of translucent gray material with visible internal structure resembling LEGO wheel design, and do they maintain consistent size and placement under the base?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels are uniformly gray and maintain consistent size and placement under the chair base. However, they do not show translucency or an internal structure typically associated with LEGO wheels. The wheels look like standard office chair wheels rather than LEGO pieces.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the chair positioned on a flat, uninterrupted white tabletop surface that contrasts with the original floor, with no visible shadows or depth inconsistencies suggesting misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is positioned on a white surface that may resemble a tabletop. The background is consistent without clear indications of shadows or depth inconsistencies. The surface appears flat and uninterrupted, suggesting it is indeed a tabletop and not the same type of floor as in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
