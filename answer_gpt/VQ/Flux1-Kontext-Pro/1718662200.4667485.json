    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's head appears large but in typical cartoon or chibi style, where exaggerated features are expected. This style often involves larger heads in relation to the body. The neck and shoulder areas do not show any signs of distortion, maintaining a natural flow from the head to the torso.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature green sunglasses; rather, red sunglasses are present. They have consistent color and reflective properties that match the cartoonish style, with no visible unnatural edges or texture breaks. Thus, the query about green sunglasses is not applicable to Image B.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's representation follows a cartoonish style, which often includes anthropomorphized features like hands with five fingers for expressive capability. The hands on the turntable in Image B appear to have five fingers each, designed with natural spacing and curvature following the anthropomorphized style rather than strict animal anatomy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the watercolor background integrate smoothly with the pig and DJ equipment, showing no abrupt edges or conflicting lighting patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watercolor backgrounds in Image B for the three illustrated panels behind the pig scenes are artistically blended with no harsh lines or abrupt edges. The lighting and color schemes are harmonious, enhancing the whimsical nature of the scene and integrating well with the pig and DJ equipment in this cartoon environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the chat bubbles and surrounding soundwave patterns clearly defined, free of jagged edges, and positioned without obstructing key features like the face or turntable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chat bubbles and surrounding soundwave patterns are clearly defined with smooth edges. The positioning does not cover essential features like the face or the turntable controls, instead, they are strategically placed around the pig, maintaining clarity and focus on main elements.",
