    "Question": "Q1:Do the crystal wands have smooth, continuous surfaces with consistent refraction and no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape?",
    "explanation": "The crystal wands in Image B appear to have smooth and continuous surfaces. The refraction observed is even and consistent, following the typical behavior of light through crystal-like structures. There are no visible digital artifacts or irregularities in shape that would suggest issues in rendering or editing of the image. This smooth appearance and continuity suggest good quality without editing flaws.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2:Are the etched floral patterns on the crystal vase evenly distributed, continuous, and visually integrated into the surface without breaking lines or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "The etched floral patterns on the crystal vase in Image B appear to be evenly distributed and continuous. The design seems visually integrated into the vase's surface, with no observed breaks in lines or inconsistent shading. This suggests that the etching is seamlessly part of the vase design, with no digital errors evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3:Is the carved crystal ribbon fully formed with intact floral motifs and no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas that suggest a 2D-to-3D conversion error?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the carved crystal ribbon wrapping the vase is fully formed with intact floral motifs. There are no visible breaks, overlaps, or flattened areas observed, which would typically signal a 2D-to-3D conversion error. The floral motifs are distinct and well-defined, suggesting accurate rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4:Does the reflection on the mirrored surface show a clear, undistorted image of the crystal vase and its contents, with proper symmetry and matching lighting?",
    "explanation": "The reflection of the crystal vase and its contents on the mirrored surface in Image B appears clear and undistorted. The reflection shows proper symmetry with the vase above, and the lighting matches that of the real vase, with consistent shading and highlight patterns. This suggests an accurate depiction without distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:Are the pearls uniformly sized, evenly spaced, and free from warping or blurring that suggests compression or incorrect rendering due to the crystal vase?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no pearls visible as there are in Image A, and thus the analysis of pearls pertains to the first image only. In the context of the crystal vase in Image B, there is no mention of or visual representation of pearls, thus making this question not applicable.",
    "answer": "No"
