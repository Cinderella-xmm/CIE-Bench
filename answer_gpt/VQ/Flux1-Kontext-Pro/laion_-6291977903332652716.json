      "question": "Are the buildings and water surface inside the sphere free from unnatural bending or warping at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the buildings and water surface are encapsulated within a spherical glass object, indicating the use of a fisheye or crystal ball effect. Such effects typically cause noticeable bending or warping of the view, especially near the sphere's edges. The visual cues suggest warping is present, a common occurrence in spherical reflections due to the curved surface of the sphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wooden beams and stucco surfaces of the houses retain clear, natural textures without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and stucco surfaces of the houses appear well-defined, with clear and natural textures. Pixelation or repeating patterns would indicate poor editing or rendering, but the texture seems coherent and natural, suggesting that high-resolution imagery was likely used, maintaining detail despite the spherical distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the water surface show smooth, continuous reflections of the buildings and sky without excessive glare or broken mirror-like effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water surface in Image B reflects the buildings and sky within the sphere. The reflections are smooth and consistent, typical of how water reflects scenes unless disturbed. There is no evident excessive glare or broken mirror-like effects, indicating that the reflections maintain a natural and undistorted appearance, despite the spherical distortion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the added mini bridges connected to both banks and do the plants grow from valid surfaces without appearing suspended in air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no additional bridges that appear superimposed or unconnected to the banks. The existing bridges seem naturally integrated into the scene. The plants also appear to grow from appropriate locations on the houses or ground, not appearing to float or hang unnaturally, suggesting a consistent and realistic portrayal of the environment within the sphere.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all visible characters have five fingers per hand, natural limb proportions, and clothing that conforms to body shape without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature figures around the sphere are stylized and intentionally simplified, likely resembling figurines or models, common in such diorama-like settings. This design choice might lead to simplified features, such as ambiguous hand details or stylized clothing, not mimicking realistic human proportions or clothing conformity. Thus, not all characters seem to adhere to realistic anatomical details such as five fingers, natural limb proportions, or clothing fit.",
