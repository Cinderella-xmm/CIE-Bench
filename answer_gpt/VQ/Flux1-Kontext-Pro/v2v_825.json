      "question": "Are the handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the calendar pages clear and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the handwritten notes and highlighted dates on the calendar are visible and distinct. The annotations such as 'Wedding' and the circles around dates are clear without any apparent visual distortion. Combining this with the expectation for legible and crisp notes, they appear clear and are easy to read.",

      "question": "Do the textures of the paper and desk appear natural and consistent with the lighting and shadows in the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paper texture and the wooden desk surface are both visible and consistent with each other. The light source seems to come from the top left, casting soft shadows that align naturally with the direction of the light. The paper reflects light subtly, indicating a matte finish that one would expect from calendar paper, and the desk has a natural wooden texture without any inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Are the calendar pages arranged neatly without any unnatural breaks or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the stack of calendar pages lies flat and evenly without any visible misalignments. The top page, marked 'JANUARY', is aligned well with the rest beneath it, and the stack has a uniform appearance suggesting the pages are cut and stacked neatly. There are no gaps or irregularities that would indicate an unnatural break.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the text and grid lines on the calendar pages sharp and well-defined without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text and grid lines in Image B are crisp and clearly defined. The numbers and labels, such as the days of the week, are sharp and do not exhibit blurring or loss of detail. The definition of the grid lines on the calendar suggests a properly printed calendar that aligns with the usual expectations of clarity on such products.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the handwritten notes and highlights consistent and natural, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the handwritten notes and highlights (yellow and blue circles) are vibrant but consistent, exhibiting no variations that would suggest editing errors. The chosen colors complement traditional highlight colors and maintain a natural appearance under the lighting conditions present in the image.",
