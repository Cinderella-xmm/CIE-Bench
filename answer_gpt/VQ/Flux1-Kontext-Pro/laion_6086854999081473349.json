    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the bark textures on the logs continuous and aligned with the original log shapes, showing no abrupt edges or inconsistent scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the logs appear to have a consistent bark texture that aligns with the log shapes. They display natural wood texture patterns without abrupt edges or changes in scale. This suggests a seamless integration of textures on the logs, reflecting an understanding of how bark naturally forms and covers a log structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing amber eyes fit precisely within the original window openings without distorting the surrounding log structure or spreading light beyond the intended area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing amber elements appear to be integrated into the window openings without distorting the adjacent log structure. The light is contained and does not spread erratically beyond these designated areas, indicating that the design maintains the integrity of the log structure and appropriately confines the glow to its intended location.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the leafy canopy extend upward from the roof ridge in a natural, gravity-consistent manner, with leaves overlapping logically and not appearing suspended or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leafy canopy in Image B stretches upward from the roof ridge in a way that mimics natural foliage growth, adhering to gravity with overlapping leaves. This configuration suggests an understanding of how leaves would naturally layer and follow the contours of a roof, ensuring a realistic presentation without any floating elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vines and moss growing along the logs and roofline in a way that follows natural climbing patterns, with no flat, disconnected patches or unnatural straight lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vines and moss are depicted following the natural patterns of climbing plants, wrapping around the logs and roofline without forming unnatural straight lines or disconnected patches. This suggests a deliberate effort to mimic the way vines naturally grow and cling to structures.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the runes carved into the logs with consistent depth and alignment, following the roundness of the logs and not appearing as flat or misaligned symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runes on the logs in Image B appear to be carved with consistent depth and follow the curvature of the logs. They do not seem flat or misaligned, suggesting that they were designed with an understanding of how such symbols would naturally be inscribed into round surfaces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the forest spirit faces positioned within the original garage door frames, with facial features properly scaled and energy trails flowing outward in a smooth, non-jagged manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest spirit faces are placed within the garage door frames and are scaled appropriately for these areas. The energy trails extending from these faces are smooth, without jagged edges, suggesting careful design to fit within the original structural outlines without disrupting the overall aesthetic of the structure.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are all structural components (logs, roof, canopy, vines, faces) connected seamlessly without gaps, floating elements, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows all the structural components connected seamlessly. The logs, roof, canopy, vines, and decorative faces are integrated without visible gaps or floating elements, maintaining a cohesive appearance with no distorted or incongruous geometry. This indicates a coherent integration and respect for natural structure in design.",
