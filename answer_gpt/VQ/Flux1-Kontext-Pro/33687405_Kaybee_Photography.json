      "question": "Are the patterns and beadwork on the woman's blue vest clearly defined and consistent with the original image's details, without blurred edges or unnatural pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns and beadwork on the woman's blue vest appear to be enhanced with more defined and intricate details. By comparison, Image A has slightly less clarity and detail in the beadwork patterns. This suggests careful editing in Image B to improve visual clarity, resulting in well-defined and consistent details without blurred edges or pixelation.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title banner 'GUARDIAN OF HERITAGE' displays a woven-texture design.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a gold-etched nameplate below the title. The gold finish is applied with subtlety, avoiding exaggerated glares and maintaining consistent surface reflections throughout. The nameplate shows uniform thickness and well-defined edges, contributing to its elegant presentation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
