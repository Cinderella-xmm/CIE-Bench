      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the elephant have clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case surrounding the elephant appears to have clear and smooth edges. The edges are sharp and well-defined, and there are no visible artifacts or distortions along the edges. The reflections on the glass are minimal and appear natural, as one would expect from clear glass. There are no unnatural or exaggerated reflections that would indicate poor editing or artificiality.",

      "question": "Are the metallic resin details on the elephantâ€™s armor consistently textured and reflective, showing no unnatural glossiness or broken patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic resin details covering the elephant's armor exhibit a consistent texture that appears reflective and metallic. The reflective nature is evident in how light interacts with the surface, producing a uniform sheen without any patches of unnatural glossiness. Additionally, the armor design is continuous without broken patterns or stitching irregularities, indicating a high-quality representation.",

      "question": "Are the silk-gold banners located at the four corners of the glass case, properly anchored, and displaying natural fabric draping and color variation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the silk-gold banners located at the corners of the glass case have no presence, as there are no visible fabric elements or banners within or around the case. Thus, questions regarding their anchoring or fabric draping and color variation do not apply to this image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the layered mountain silhouettes in the background show gradual opacity and depth, with no sharp edges or inconsistent transparency levels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features mountain silhouettes which exhibit a gradual transition in opacity and depth. These silhouettes have soft edges and a layered depth that is suitable for conveying a distant landscape. The mountains do not show abrupt transitions or inconsistent transparency levels, aligning with what one would expect in a real scenic view.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges realistically integrated into the rocky surface, with natural leaf textures and root placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bonsai-like trees in the foreground are attached to the rocky surfaces quite realistically. The leaf textures of the trees appear natural, with a believable organic structure and distribution. The roots and tree bases align seamlessly with the rocky surface, suggesting a realistic integration without appearing floating or poorly edited.",
