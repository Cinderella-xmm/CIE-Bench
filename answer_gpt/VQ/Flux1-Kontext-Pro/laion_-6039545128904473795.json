    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the central body aligned with the original angular design and free from visible texture artifacts or shape distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the drone's central body's design, while angular as expected for such a device, contains no visible facial features. Based on the general understanding of drone design, no texture artifacts or distortions can be identified in what seems to be a featureless central body. Without any visible irregularities, one would affirm that the central body remains true to an expected angular design, focusing more on functional structure rather than non-existent facial aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the arms formed from rotor blades have consistent proportions and smooth joints that suggest functional rotation without visible warping or breakage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the arms of the drone maintain a consistent proportion throughout and have smooth, well-defined joints. The appearance of the rotor blades aligns with what would be necessary for functional rotation, with no evidence of warping or manual breakage. This likely suggests that their assembly and visual design permit expected drone functionality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the spider-like legs connected at the original landing gear locations and do they display coherent joint structures without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the legs of the drone appear connected to the original landing gear locations, presenting a coherent joint structure. There are no visible gaps or segments that give the impression of floating or disconnecting from the main body, indicative of intentional design for plausible landing use.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the drone consistent with the futuristic cityscape background, showing appropriate metallic reflections and no harsh transitions between the drone and environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is consistent with a futuristic cityscape environment. The drone exhibits appropriate reflections consistent with metallic surfaces, and the ambient lighting integrates smoothly with the environment without any harsh transitions. This provides a seamless appearance as if the drone is genuinely part of the cityscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble positioned near the robotic face with clear, legible text and no overlap with drone components or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble is well-positioned near the central body of the drone and is free of overlap with the drone components or background elements. The text is clear and legible, fitting neatly into the speech bubble in a manner that ensures readability within the futuristic scene.",
