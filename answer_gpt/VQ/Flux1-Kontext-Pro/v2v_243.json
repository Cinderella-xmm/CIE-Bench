      "question": "Do the transformed skis and hockey sticks maintain their original structural integrity and proportions as footwear, avoiding any unnatural distortions or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skis have been transformed into boots. The boots appear to be structurally sound and proportionally accurate as footwear. The design does not exhibit any unnatural distortions or breaks in geometry, which indicates that the transformation was done while maintaining appropriate proportions for boots.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the vivid patterns and wooden textures from the original skis and hockey sticks naturally incorporated into the footwear design without introducing any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vividly patterned designs from the skis are transferred onto the boots, showing a consistent and seamless integration. The patterns and colors are vivid without noticeable loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures. The wooden texture of the hockey stick also remains natural in its transformed state.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition from skis and hockey sticks to footwear appear logical and plausible, maintaining the visual credibility of both the original and new forms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition from skis to boots in Image B maintains visual credibility. The design transformation made the original ski patterns into boot patterns in a way that respects the original aesthetic while adapting to the shape of boots logically, giving the impression that the transformation is plausible.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the original skis and hockey sticks been preserved in the new footwear design, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the fine details of the original ski patterns have been well-preserved in the new boot design. There is no noticeable loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures, as the vibrant colors and intricate patterns are clearly transferred to the boots.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the new footwear design respect the physical properties and proportions of the original skis and hockey sticks, avoiding any distortion or damage to geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation appears to respect the boot form's physical properties and proportions. There seems to be no distortion or damage to the geometric shapes in Image B. The design preserves the essence of the original skis and sticks, adapting them convincingly into a footwear form.",
