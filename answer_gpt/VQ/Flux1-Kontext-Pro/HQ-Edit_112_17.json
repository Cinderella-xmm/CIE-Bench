      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hammer's handle display a uniform deep blue enamel surface with no visible cracks, rough patches, or color variations, and does the head show realistic metallic sheen with consistent reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer's handle is covered in a deep blue enamel that appears uniform with no visible imperfections such as cracks or rough patches. The color is consistent throughout the handle. The head of the hammer displays a metallic sheen, indicative of a realistic material reflection. These visual cues suggest that the appearance is consistent with high-quality enamel and metal.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers retain their original shapes and proportions, with smooth, reflective enamel surfaces and no warped edges, missing details, or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the chisel, file, wrench, and pliers with their typical shapes and proportions, all appearing intact without visible distortion or warping. The surfaces maintain a consistent appearance with smooth, reflective textures, suggesting enamel, and there are no noticeable transitions that seem out of place. This implies that these tools are edited to maintain a well-finished and coherent look without material discrepancies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the enamel shavings shaped into natural-looking curls with varied thickness and smooth, glossy surfaces, avoiding flat or rigid appearances and maintaining fine detail along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the enamel shavings are depicted as curled with a degree of natural variation in their shapes and thickness. They have smooth, glossy surfaces that catch light, avoiding a flat or artificially stiff appearance. The edges of these shavings show fine detail, adding to the lifelike quality. This suggests a careful design in portraying these as dynamic elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the linen fabric background show a natural weave texture with soft folds and slight color variation, and does it provide a visually coherent base for the enamel tools without appearing artificial or overly smooth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B displays a linen texture with visible weave patterns and slight color variations, which are characteristic of natural linen fabric. The folds in the fabric are soft, providing a realistic base for the tools. The fabric doesn't look overly smooth or artificial, giving a sense of authentic materiality.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the enamel tools consistent with a single light source and the reflective nature of enamel, and do all tools rest naturally on the fabric without gaps, floating effects, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows and highlights on the tools suggest a consistent light source illuminating them, which complements the reflective characteristics of enamel. The shadows align with a single direction, underscoring the uniform lighting. Moreover, each tool appears to rest naturally on the fabric surface, with no visible gaps, floating effects, or misalignments, indicating a coherent and realistic composition.",
