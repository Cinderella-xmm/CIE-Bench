        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids composed of black, orange, and yellow strands exhibit a uniform thickness and a smooth, regular curvature throughout their length. The alignment appears consistent, without breaks or anomalies, showing careful adjustment in the image editing process to maintain a natural braided appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold earrings in Image B retain their original size and position, hanging naturally from the ear with the intricate mesh pattern and metallic sheen preserved. They are not repositioned on the headpiece; instead, they are still in their standard ear-hanging position, consistently maintaining their detailed appearance.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flowers, braids, and earrings are well-integrated with the hair and head arrangement, showing no visible gaps or floating elements. The components of the headpiece visually align with the surrounding features, giving the impression of being physically attached to the head and hair without any dissonance.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, no seams, unnatural shadows, or texture discontinuities are visible where the headpiece interacts with the face or hair. The transition between the headpiece elements and the other parts of the image appears smooth and coherent, indicating clean editing without errors at the junctions.",
