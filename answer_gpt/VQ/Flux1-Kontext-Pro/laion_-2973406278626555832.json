      "question": "Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background in Panel 1 appears to be a laboratory setting. The lighting throughout is consistent with soft, diffused illumination typical for indoor environments. The depth alignment seems appropriate as there are no floating or out-of-place elements that suggest disconnection. The background complements the figure in the foreground without any abrupt or disjointed transitions, indicating good alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vape device is positioned naturally in the hand, similar to how an object of such shape and size would be held. The fingers appear to be wrapped comfortably around the device, with no visible distortion, unnatural bending, or misalignment that would indicate stretching or compression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depicted vape device appears well-rendered with distinct features. The glass component exhibits transparency with visible liquid inside, implying clarity. The smooth reflections on the surface and the absence of pixelation or blurring suggest high image quality, with natural highlights rather than artificial or exaggerated ones.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 2 displays the internal components of the vape device schematically. The coil is accurately positioned above the liquid chamber, and the airflow path is illustrated with unbroken lines that depict a feasible route through the device. The relative sizes of different components follow the logical design of such a device.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text bubbles and labels are neatly placed without overlapping critical features of clothing or objects. They follow a logical reading direction, enhancing comprehension. No clipping or misplacement is evident, allowing for seamless reading experience.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand visible in Panel 1 shows five fingers, each with natural curvature and joint bending. There are no signs of deformity, fusion, or elongation, ensuring the hand's anatomy appears normal and proportionate.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the photographic elements and illustrated panels is smooth. No visible seams, double outlines, or noticeable color mismatches are present along the boundaries, ensuring a cohesive appearance.",
