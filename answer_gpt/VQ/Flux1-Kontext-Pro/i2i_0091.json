      "question": "Does the integration of the castle hall elements into the room visually align with the existing lighting and shadows, avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of castle hall elements like stone walls and wooden beams appear to effectively match the lighting and shadows as sunlight streams in through the windows, casting shadows consistent with the direction of light. This congruence in elements and lighting indicates that the integration has been executed without jarring transitions or obvious discrepancies, such as mismatched lighting or shadow discrepancies.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the materials of the newly added castle hall elements, like stone and metal, depicted naturally and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the stone walls and wooden elements have a realistic textural quality with consistent lighting that suggests natural materials. The texture of the stone and the finishing of the wood appears coherent, with no visible digital artifacts like blurring or pixelation that would indicate poor blending. This natural depiction is essential for maintaining the immersive quality of the edited scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the books, vases, and plants remained undistorted and preserved their original details post-editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no books, and the focus is primarily on furniture and architectural elements. The absence of books, vases, and plants suggests that these objects have been removed rather than edited improperly. Therefore, ensuring they remain undistorted is irrelevant, as these items are not present in Image B at all.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the introduction of the castle hall maintain the room's spatial rationality, keeping the proportions and placements of objects consistent with expectations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features the introduction of castle-like architectural elements that appear proportionate within the room's spatial design. The placement of furniture such as cabinets is logical and consistent with the room's layout, maintaining expected spatial rationality. The scale of the added elements integrates seamlessly rather than overwhelming or diminishing the space, which supports the rationality of the design.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting effects in the edited castle hall scene match the light source and style of the original room, ensuring continuity in illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B aligns with the visible light source, as sunlight enters through large windows and casts consistent shadows throughout the room. The shadows on the floor and walls match the direction and intensity of the incoming light, ensuring continuity in illumination and maintaining stylistic coherence. This aspect demonstrates a well-integrated lighting design that complements the new architectural elements.",
