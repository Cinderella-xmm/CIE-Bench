    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the sausages made from tessellated tiles, and these tiles accurately mimic the elongated, slightly curved shape of sausages as in real life. The tiles fit together seamlessly to preserve the natural curvature and appearance of the sausages seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tessellated depiction of lettuce uses tiles that are arranged to reflect the natural ruffled and layered appearance of lettuce leaves. Unlike a uniform or blocky arrangement, the tiles vary in size and shape, capturing the irregular natural look of the lettuce seen in Image A.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the egg made from tiles that are arranged to create a near-perfect circular shape, with the yolk being centrally placed. This setup captures the proportions and orientation similar to the egg in Image A, ensuring a faithful representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic composition positions the elements somewhat equally but not strictly symmetrically around a center as in a balanced design. The spatial arrangement in Image A is a typical plate layout which conveys natural asymmetry in food placement rather than mosaic symmetry.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the glass tiles with precise edge definition, consistent color shading, and subtle reflections. These elements are distinctly visible without any artifacts like blurring or jagged lines, showcasing the quality of the mosaic creation process.",
