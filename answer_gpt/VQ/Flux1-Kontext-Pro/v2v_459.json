      "question": "Do the vibrant striped and polka dot patterns on the 3D chibi-style ties appear undistorted and maintain their original integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the striped tie on the left shows clear, straight lines with uninterrupted vibrant colors. The polka dot tie on the right displays evenly spaced dots that are consistent throughout the fabric. By examining the visual integrity of both ties, it is clear that there are no distortions or interruptions in the patterns, which maintain their original design integrity. This indicates that the patterns are undistorted and retain their original vibrant appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style ties seamlessly integrated into the realistic drawer setting without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style ties are placed inside a drawer with complementary textures and lighting. The drawer's wood grain and color, as well as the fabric surface of the ties, share consistent lighting and color tones, which helps blend the ties with their surroundings. There are no apparent artifacts or mismatched textures that stand out, suggesting the ties are integrated smoothly into the setting.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties retain proper proportions and physical rationality, ensuring no geometric shapes are broken or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties maintain an expected size relative to their placement within the drawer. The geometric design on each tie, including stripes and dots, follows straight lines and circular shapes that are uniform and undistorted. The ties also maintain a realistic physical form, adhering to expectations around how ties should appear in size and shape.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the 3D chibi-style ties exhibit consistent material properties, such as texture and sheen, similar to their original appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties display a consistent texture that suggests a smooth, fabric-like material. The sheen on the ties is uniform and reflective of how polished fabrics might appear in real life. The visual representation of material properties, including the smoothness and subtle lighting effects on the tie surfaces, align well with expectations for cloth used in tie-making.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the 3D chibi-style ties within the drawer setting adhere to common sense and physical logic, ensuring visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ties are laid neatly inside the drawer, with the drawer only partially open to appropriately fit both ties. This arrangement allows for easy viewing and access, aligning with typical storage methods for such accessories. There is no overlapping that would suggest impractical storage, and the ties rest naturally as expected within the drawer setting, adhering to real-world physical logic.",
