    "explanation": "The violin in Image B is carefully adorned with reflective gold inlays that line up with the logical contours of the instrument. The gold elements exhibit a consistent metallic sheen, displaying realistic reflections that align with how light interacts with metallic surfaces. This adherence to the natural form ensures that none appear detached or misaligned.",
