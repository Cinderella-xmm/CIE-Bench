      "question": "Does the lattice-like scale pattern along the serpent's body follow the spiral curve smoothly without abrupt breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lattice-like scale pattern on the serpent's body is examined for continuity along its spiral form. The scales are uniformly arranged and follow the curvature of the serpent smoothly, without exhibiting noticeable breaks or misaligned edges. This gives the impression of a cohesive design that complements the serpent’s spiral posture. Employing world knowledge of design and art, such patterns are typically intended to mimic natural forms without interruptions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the individual segments of the serpent's body aligned with the original stair treads such that each segment corresponds to a step in size and spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the serpent's body displays a continuous and unified form rather than segmented parts that align with the stairs. The design does not necessarily correspond with each step in terms of physical dimensions or spacing, as the serpent's body is an individual element that transcends the original stair layout rather than aligning with it step-by-step. This observation suggests that the serpent's form is independent of the step structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the translucent fins extend from the original railing position in a continuous, flowing manner without gaps or distortions in their shape or placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the serpent with a scaly surface and does not feature translucent fins extending in a manner comparable to a railing. Given the context of choosing between a railing and a serpent representation, the absence of a railing-like fin arrangement indicates that the question is likely rooted in an understanding of the serpent as a single cohesive form devoid of such fin-like details.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the marble-like texture on the serpent’s body evenly distributed and consistent with the lighting and shading of the original staircase surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent in Image B is defined by a consistent scale pattern, and while it does have highlights and shadows accentuating its three-dimensionality, it diverges from a marble texture which is typically smooth and slightly glossy. The texture is more reptilian and organic than marble-like and stands out from the smoother staircase surroundings both in texture and shading.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the serpent’s head positioned within the circular opening at the top of the staircase without overlapping or deforming the surrounding wall or ceiling structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The serpent's head in Image B is prominently positioned away from any architectural confines like circular openings or the ceiling structure of a staircase. It is shown in the lower part of the image, evidently not interacting with any such structure that might cause overlap or deformation. The lack of any ceiling opening suggests that this spatial relationship does not exist.",
