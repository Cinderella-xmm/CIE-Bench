      "question": "Do the vine-like tendrils follow the natural contour of the head without floating or breaking apart at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vine-like tendrils are artistically woven into the hair, ensuring they follow the curve of the head. They maintain a natural look by resting against the hair and scalp without any visible gaps or unnatural separations. This kind of attention to detail helps create a cohesive and realistic appearance, implying they are a part of the head's adornment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the laurel leaves and pastel flowers aligned naturally within the hair structure without overlapping the face or appearing detached from the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laurel leaves and pastel flowers are harmoniously integrated into the hairstyle. They appear rooted within the hair, respecting the natural hairline and the directionality of hair strands. No elements seem to break this arrangement by encroaching on the facial area or showing signs of detachment from the head.",

      "question": "Does the emerald green tunic show natural fabric folds and shading that match the posture and lighting of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the tunic in Image B, the emerald green fabric displays realistic folds and shading that correspond with the body's posture. The muscles and stance suggest the fabric would rest against the skin, creating natural folds and complying with light sources from the surrounding forest environment. The way shadows are cast and the natural draping observed corroborate this.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the twisted olive trees and marble fragments positioned at a plausible distance from the subject, with correct perspective and no floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the twisted olive trees and the fragments on the ground appear strategically placed to give a sense of depth and natural landscape. The perspective aligns with the scene’s central focus and creates an acceptable visual distance from the subject. There are no elements that appear to defy gravity or seem out of place, indicating an artful and well-thought-out composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the subject’s face and clothing align with the ambient light source suggested by the background environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ambient light in Image B suggests a diffused, soft lighting environment typical of a forest setting. The subject's clothing and visible parts of the body exhibit shadowing and highlights that match this ambient light. The transition from light to shadow on the clothes and form correlates to a natural light source from above and slightly to the side, consistent with the setting.",
