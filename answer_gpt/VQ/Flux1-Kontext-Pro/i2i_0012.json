      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the landscape background is adapted to a Studio Ghibli style while maintaining the basic geometric shapes and layout found in the original painting.

This adaptation respects natural anatomy within an animated style framework.",
