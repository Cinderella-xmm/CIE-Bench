      "question": "Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi rendition of the dancer, reflected in the portal, follows the typical stylized design for chibi characters, which often features a larger head and shorter limbs relative to the body. While stylized, these proportions are normal for chibi representations and not indicative of unnatural distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the glowing elliptical portal visually credible, with no obvious artifacts where it meets the realistic dance studio environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing elliptical portal appears seamlessly integrated into the dance studio. The lighting effects around the portal and its reflections on the surrounding surfaces, such as the floor, are consistent and credible, with no visible artifacts or discrepancies where the portal connects to the room environment.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dancer's hand extending towards the viewer retain natural textures and details, with no more than five fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's hand reaching out towards the viewer maintains realistic skin textures and details as expected in a human hand rendering. There are five fingers visible, which adhere to natural human hand anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world consistent with the dancer's pose, contributing to a natural and visually plausible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the grayscale chibi character's pose and the lighting effects reflected in the portal create a coherent scene. The spotlight effects are consistent with the position and movement suggested by the pose, maintaining visual plausibility in the reflection.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal positioned in a balanced manner that enhances visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's composition, featuring the dancer positioned in front of the portal, aligns with the 2:3 aspect ratio commonly used for portraits and artistic photographs. The arrangement of elements within the frame is balanced, contributing to a visually credible and aesthetically pleasing scene.",
