      "question": "Do the Russian nesting dolls maintain the recognizable shape and proportions of the giraffe without introducing unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are styled to resemble a giraffe, which typically has a tall and slender shape. These nesting dolls have been stylized to reflect giraffe characteristics, such as the pattern and the vertical form. While the giraffe proportions have been adapted to fit the nesting doll form, the transformation respects the typical giraffe markings without showing unrealistic distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures on the Russian nesting dolls consistent with the giraffe's fur pattern, avoiding unnatural or overly smooth surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Russian nesting dolls in Image B feature a pattern that mimics the giraffe's distinctive fur pattern of irregular spots against a golden brown background. This pattern is coherent with what a real giraffe's fur looks like and does not exhibit any overly smooth or artificial texture that would stray from the natural look.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the transition between the different sizes of the Russian nesting dolls smooth, without visible seams or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Russian nesting dolls transition smoothly between different sizes. The characteristic profile of nesting dolls is round and smooth, ensuring the differences in size are consistent with typical Russian nesting dolls. The smooth edges of the nesting dolls provide a seamless appearance, which avoids any visible seams or unnatural edges.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of the Russian nesting dolls on the wooden table look balanced and natural, without any dolls appearing to float or overlap unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the nesting dolls are placed on the wooden table in a clearly ordered fashion from largest to smallest. Each doll is standing on the table, maintaining a stable and grounded appearance, with no signs of floating or overlapping in a manner that would appear unnatural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the lighting and shadows on the Russian nesting dolls and the wooden table consistent with the lighting in the original image, avoiding any unrealistic highlights or dark spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the nesting dolls with a lighting setup that matches the soft and diffused lighting seen in the original giraffe image, Image A. Shadows appear to fall naturally on the table and within the curves of the dolls, consistent with the ambient lighting of an indoor setting, avoiding unrealistic elements like intense highlights or stark shadow contrasts that would clash with the original's natural environmental lighting.",
