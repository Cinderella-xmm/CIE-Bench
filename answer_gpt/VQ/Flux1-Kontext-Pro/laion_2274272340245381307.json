      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist fully integrated into the image with smooth contours, consistent line weight, and no visible seams or misaligned textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teddy bear scientist appears well-integrated into the scene. The contours are smooth, with consistent line weight throughout its features. There are no visible seams or texture misalignments that would disrupt the overall harmony of the image. This integration suggests that the bear fits naturally within the scene, resembling an actual chalkboard drawing in style.",

      "question": "Are the lab equipment illustrations (e.g., beakers, test tubes) proportionally accurate, geometrically intact, and aligned with the hand-drawn chalk style without jagged edges or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lab equipment illustrations in the image maintain proportional accuracy and geometric integrity. They are styled consistently with the hand-drawn chalk aesthetic, lacking jagged edges or unnatural shading. These elements adhere to the chalkboard theme and complement the other doodles, indicating a cohesive artistic approach.",

      "question": "Do all scientific symbols and doodles (such as planets, rockets, and formulas) have intact geometric forms, proper alignment, and no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scientific symbols and doodles retain intact geometric forms with proper alignment on the chalkboard. They do not exhibit overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines, maintaining a clean and organized presentation consistent with the chalk drawing style. This precision adds to the thematic expression of the image, supporting its playful yet coherent design.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters (e.g., bear, rabbit) exhibit correct limb positioning, proportional body parts, and logical interaction with nearby objects without unnatural poses or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal characters in the image, such as the bear and rabbit, show correct limb positioning and proportional body parts. They interact logically with nearby objects, and there are no signs of unnatural poses or deformations. This natural presentation contributes to the cohesive and playful illustration style.",
