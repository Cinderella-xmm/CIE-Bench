      "question": "Is the surface of the unicornâ€™s body uniformly smooth and reflective, resembling a glazed ceramic finish without patches of residual fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn appears to have a surface that is entirely smooth and uniform, resembling a material like glazed ceramic, unlike natural fur textures. This indicates a deliberate design choice for a polished, artificial appearance, akin to sculptures or modern art pieces. Utilizing world knowledge about materials used in sculpting, the glossy, refined finish lacks the real-life texture of fur, leading to the conclusion that the surface is uniformly smooth and reflective.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the mane and tail composed of thin, curved porcelain-like structures that follow the natural flow of the original hair and are securely attached to the head and base of the tail without floating or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mane and tail of the unicorn appear to be crafted from smooth, solid material, resembling porcelain, and display an intricate design that mimics the flowing nature of real hair. These elements maintain their structural integrity, adhering closely to the sculpture with no indication of floating or disintegration. This reflects the characteristics of crafted porcelain which, being solid and durable, allows for artistic expressions while retaining form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the horn form a continuous, symmetrical spiral shape made of reflective metallic material, originating from the same position as the original horn and maintaining proportional size relative to the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's horn exhibits a smooth, symmetrical spiral shape consistent with a reflective metallic appearance. The position and proportionality in relation to the head resemble that seen in artistic sculptures or depictions of mythical creatures, where such cohesiveness in design is crucial. The choice of material and form aligns with traditional representations of unicorns, known for their spiral horns.",

      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned on a flat, subtly textured stone base that contrasts with the original forest floor, with no visible remnants of trees, dirt, or foliage in the immediate surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn is displayed on a clearly defined, flat stone base that is clearly contrasting with the intricate and earthy textures found in outdoor environments like forests. This base supports indoor settings like galleries, devoid of natural elements such as trees, dirt, or foliage, consistent with the presentation of sculptures designed for static display.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the sculpture soft and directional, casting subtle highlights on the glazed surface and porcelain curls, consistent with indoor gallery illumination rather than outdoor moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting is soft and controlled, creating gentle highlights across the sculpture's surface, indicative of indoor, possibly gallery-style lighting. The indoor environment enhances the smooth, reflective surfaces with nuanced illumination, unlike outdoor moonlight, which tends to cast a harsher and more diffuse glow over objects.",
