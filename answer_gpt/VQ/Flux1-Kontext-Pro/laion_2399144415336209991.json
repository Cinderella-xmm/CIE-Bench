      "question": "Are the enhanced beads on the bride's shoulder straps evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the fabric's surface without appearing detached or unnaturally sharp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads on the bride's shoulder straps appear stylized but evenly spaced and continuous, indicative of uniform designs in cartoon illustrations. There is no abrupt or unnatural sharpness in these beads; they appear to be consistent and aligned with the fabric's surface as a part of the stylized depiction of the bride's attire.",

      "question": "Is the enlarged lapel of the groom's suit proportionally consistent with the rest of the jacket, and does it retain a smooth edge without jagged lines or distorted angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the lapel appears to maintain proportional consistency with the rest of the cartoonized jacket. The edges seem smooth, typical of digital illustrations, without visible jagged lines or distorted angles.",

      "question": "Do the hands in the \"holding hands\" pose have five fingers each, correctly aligned joints, and natural skin texture without distortion or overlapping limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands in the 'holding hands' pose seem to have a simplified appearance due to the cartoon style, which might not depict every finger distinctly. However, the overall structure suggests correctly aligned joints without noticeable distortion; though extended simplification in 'hand' features is typical in stylized drawings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the heart-shaped border fully contained around the couple without cutting into their bodies or clothing, and are the gold trim and floral engravings clearly defined without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the illustration of Image B, the heart-shaped border is visibly complete and fully contains the couple. The gold trim and floral engravings appear well-defined, without signs of blurring or misalignment, which aligns with the characteristic of clean lines and distinct borders in stylized art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cartoonized features of both the bride and groom uniformly stylized, with consistent line work and shading that do not clash with each other or create abrupt transitions in texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoonized features in Image B present consistent line work and shading for both individuals. The stylistic choices do not clash, and there are no abrupt transitions in texture, which is common in cohesive and polished digital illustrations.",
