      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the pixel-patterned facades on the skyscrapers align precisely with the original building outlines, showing no distorted edges or misaligned blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facades of the skyscrapers have been digitally altered to give a neon effect, with pixel-patterns replacing the original textures. By analyzing the edges and outlines of the buildings in this image, it appears that the patterns follow the contours of the buildings without noticeable distortion or misalignment. The reasoning here involves examining how the pixels match up with the known geometric structure of typical skyscrapers, expecting these to remain consistent with the expected form despite the digital alteration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the angular digital circuits forming the trees connected logically from base to tip, with no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digitally altered trees in Image B appear to have been converted into a style reminiscent of angular digital art, with circuit-like patterns forming from base to tip. In examining these visual details, there are no apparent floating or disconnected segments along the main structure of these digital trees. The continuity in the design suggests logical connection, akin to how real trees have continuous branches and leaves.",

      "question": "Do the neon lights along the bridge run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels without gaps or incorrect bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a neon effect is applied along the bridge. By focusing on the alignment and continuity of these neon lights, they seem to be applied uniformly without visible gaps or awkward bends that could disrupt the appearance of consistent and smooth illumination along the bridge structure. The visual consistency in the neon effect aligns with an expected continuous application.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all skyscrapers in the skyline uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers, with no partial or missing conversions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, every skyscraper visible within the city's skyline has been transformed with a pixelated, luminous look giving a futuristic aesthetic. This pattern is applied consistently across all skyscrapers within the frame, with no visible signs of partial transformations or omissions. The uniformity reflects a comprehensive editing style applied equally to the entire skyline.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the window grids on the buildings, the individual beams of the bridge, and the foliage of non-digital trees still clearly visible and undistorted after editing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while there is a considerable amount of digital alteration, key structural and natural elements remain visible. The window grids on the buildings have been transformed but are discernible; the bridge's structure including individual beams is clear, and the trees, although with a digital pattern, retain a recognizable form. This indicates that despite heavy editing, key features remain undistorted.",
