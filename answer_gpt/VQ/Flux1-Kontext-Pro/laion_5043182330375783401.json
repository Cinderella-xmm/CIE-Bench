    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes applied to the suit clearly defined, aligned with the contours of the body, and free from jagged or broken edges that disrupt the figure’s natural posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit has geometric shapes that are clearly defined along the contours of the body. These shapes align well with the natural posture of the figure, exhibiting smooth edges that do not appear jagged or broken, which suggests that the geometric elements are well integrated into the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chair retain a stable, grounded structure with symmetrical, flowing patterns that align with the figure’s seated position and do not appear to float or tilt unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a chair that has a stable and grounded structure. The patterns on the chair are symmetrical and flow naturally, supporting the seated position of the figure. The chair does not appear to float or tilt, maintaining the stability required for the pose.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the sunset gradient in the background smooth and continuous, with no abrupt color shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a sunset gradient that is smooth and continuous, transitioning seamlessly in colors. There are no abrupt color shifts or haloing effects along the edges of the figure, indicating a well-blended and cohesive backdrop.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and blue areas of the suit show coherent highlights and reflections that follow a single light source and avoid repeating textures or unnatural glossiness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases areas of metallic silver and blue on the suit that exhibit coherent highlights and reflections. These follow a single light source, and the textures are consistent across the fabric. There is no unnatural glossiness or repeating textures that disrupt the realistic depiction of material.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand on the chair have five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and are the joints and knuckles proportionally accurate and not distorted by stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand depicted in Image B on the chair shows five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature. The joints and knuckles appear proportionally accurate, without any distortion due to stylization, maintaining a realistic anatomical representation.",
