      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church's façade is encapsulated under a dome, maintaining the original symmetry and design elements seen in Image A. The columns and arches are properly aligned, without any visible distortions or breaks. The architectural integrity is preserved, which suggests careful and accurate rendering in the porcelain medium.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows human figures scaled down to pewter models under the dome. Upon examining the hands and limbs, they appear normal with correct proportions (fingers not exceeding five), and the postures of the figures appear natural. There is no evidence of joint bending or distortion that would suggest otherwise.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the baroque-style dome fully enclosing the scene without gaps, overlapping incorrectly with the church or ground, or showing seams or incomplete surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dome appears to cover the entire scene of the church. It does not show any visible seams or gaps where it is supposed to join with the base. The dome is installed without inappropriate overlaps with either the church structure or the ground, indicating a complete and faultless enclosing.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts trees under the dome that maintain natural branch structures, and the material appears to be a glass-like substance, suggesting transparent and refractive qualities. The outlines are smooth without jagged edges, and the coloration remains natural, consistent with the material's properties.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The café tables and umbrellas in Image B are appropriately scaled down under the dome. The umbrella canopies are circular, and the tables have straight, uniformly spaced legs. Their shapes are intact, reflecting accurate scale adjustments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the antique marble base display consistent veining patterns and appropriate thickness, and is it positioned directly beneath the scene without floating or clipping errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble base exhibits uniform veining patterns typical of antique marble, with suitable thickness proportionate to the overall scene. The base appears to be correctly positioned beneath the rendered scene without signs of floating or clipping errors.",
