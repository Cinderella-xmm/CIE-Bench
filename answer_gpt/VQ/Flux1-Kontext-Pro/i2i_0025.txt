    "Question": "Q1: Does the womanâ€™s face exhibit natural contours and shading without visible unnatural textures or blotches in the watercolor style?",
    "explanation": "The watercolor style applied in Image B should provide smooth transitions and natural shading to reflect realistic contours. In the edited image, the colors and shading should resemble traditional watercolor techniques, emphasizing fluid transitions rather than static blotches or unnatural patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor style should simplify the background figures using light lines and color washes. This involves maintaining the integrity of shapes without introducing harsh geometric breaks or inconsistent shapes that would differ from real human forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",
    "explanation": "The watercolor transformation in Image B should preserve natural anatomical details such as the correct number of fingers and their usual curvature and spacing, avoiding distortions or unrealistic hand shapes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",
    "explanation": "Image B should depict the wine glass in a manner that retains its transparency and realistic reflections. The watercolor technique should not overly stylize the glass to the point where it loses detail or its essential transparent quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
    "explanation": "In the watercolor style of Image B, the interactions of shadows and spatial relationships should be accurately depicted. This means that lighting, shadow placement, and spatial alignment should remain realistic, without causing the elements to visually float or distort.",
    "answer": "Yes"
