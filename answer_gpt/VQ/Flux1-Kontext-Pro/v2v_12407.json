      "question": "Does the mango retain its recognizable shape and texture in the 8-bit pixel art style without appearing overly distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is depicted using an 8-bit pixel art style, which inherently reduces the level of detail and smoothness found in the original image. Despite this reduction in detail, the overall shape and color of the mango are maintained, allowing it to be recognized as a mango by viewers. The pixelation does not overly distort its form to the point of losing its identity as a mango. Image A depicts a smoothly surfaced mango with natural lighting, which confirms the identifiable shape and color seen in Image B. Thus, the pixel art style retains the essence of the mango's recognizable features.",

      "question": "Are the table and napkin depicted with consistent structure and proportions in the 8-bit pixel art style, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or disproportionate elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the table and napkin in 8-bit pixel art style, which alters the precision in geometry and proportions. Despite this, the table maintains its basic rectangular shape and parallel lines, and the napkin follows a folded structure similar to what would be expected from the original image. The pixel art maintains lines and angles that match typical napkin and table configurations, and there are no broken or disproportionate elements visible. Comparing with Image A, the consistency is adequate given the pixel art constraints.",

      "question": "Do the fine details of the mango's surface and the napkin's texture remain discernible in the 8-bit pixel art style, without significant loss or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B reveals that the 8-bit pixelation significantly reduces the visibility of fine details on both the mango’s surface and the napkin’s textured folds. The pixel art inherently simplifies textures to basic color blocks, losing the finer points seen in Image A, such as the mango's skin texture or the pattern of the napkin. This simplification leads to a loss of detail rather than fidelity to the intricate surface textures, which makes these details less discernible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadow effects on the mango and table in the 8-bit pixel art style appear natural and plausible, without introducing any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite being in an 8-bit style, the effects of light and shadow are depicted using varied color shading on the mango and table surfaces. The pixel art appropriately uses darker shades to imply shadows and lighter tones for highlights, maintaining plausible lighting conditions. The shadows and highlights follow typical light source logic, similar to what they would be in the original scene shown in Image A, avoiding any drastic artifacts or unnatural appearances.",

      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the mango, napkin, and table in the 8-bit pixel art style visually credible and structurally sound, without any elements appearing misplaced or out of context?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the composition of the mango, napkin, and table in a coherent layout even within the pixelated style. Each element is positioned logically, much like in Image A, with the mango centered on the napkin, which is in turn situated on the table. Their spatial arrangement remains credible and does not appear distorted or misplaced, ensuring that the overall structure is sound.",
