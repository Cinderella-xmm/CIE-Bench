    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the face being blurred, the visible parts such as the whiskers are intact and appear to be in the correct position, suggesting the nose and mouth would also be maintained appropriately. They do not show any visible distortion or loss of detail. The material change to bronze implies retention of the original shape if common sculptural techniques are followed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet appears to fit snugly on the head, with no visible gaps or misalignments. The transition from the helmet to the rest of the bronze sculpture is seamless, indicating proper scaling and positioning, a standard expectation for sculptures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area that would typically feature glasses is obscured, so a direct evaluation of the glasses' fit is not possible. However, assuming that the sculptural techniques applied throughout the statue were consistent and realistic, the glasses would likely sit correctly over the eyes. Without visible details, realistic glass-like reflections are less relevant in a solid bronze sculpture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze sweater has retained its original shape, with contours and shoulder straps accurately depicted in the bronze material. The engraved lines follow the garmentâ€™s contours smoothly and do not appear broken or artificial, suggesting skilled craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the marble base is directly beneath the sculpture and looks proportionally sized to support the figure. Considering the common practice in sculpture, the base is crafted to provide adequate support without visible gaps, ensuring stability.",
