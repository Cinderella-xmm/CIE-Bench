    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the ivy formations on the hammerhead shaped like symmetrical, watchful eyes with natural leaf arrangement and no visible digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hammer has been transformed into a piece resembling an owl's head, with luminous green eyes replacing any ivy formations. The eyes substantially deviate from an ivy arrangement, showing a digital enhancement in brightness and suggesting a whimsical, fantasy element in the editing. Common sense tells us ivy usually grows irregularly, and this edited representation introduces digital effects absent in natural foliage.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss-covered bark texture cover the hammer and anvil uniformly without abrupt color shifts, patchy areas, or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the hammer and anvil enveloped in a moss-like texture that appears organic and cohesive, with consistent coloration across surfaces. The moss seems natural without any discernible abrupt changes in color or digital patterning typical of synthetic overlays. Based on world knowledge, a natural moss cover would have gradual variations rather than stark and irregular transitions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the root-like structures beneath the anvil extend downward from the base in a way that mimics real tree roots, with tapering thickness and no floating or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays convincingly natural root-like extensions from beneath the anvil, tapering in thickness as expected in real tree roots. There are no visible breaks or inconsistencies suggesting artificial placement; all segments connect uniformly, touching the forest ground seamlessly. World knowledge indicates such continuity and tapering are typical traits of genuine roots.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald runes integrated into the bark surface such that they appear carved in, with subtle glow that blends into the surrounding texture and does not cause bright outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald runes in Image B are incorporated into the bark, emitting a glow that subtly merges with the moss-covered surface, avoiding conspicuous outlines or pixelation that might undermine realism. Given common knowledge, carved elements typically taper into the surface, allowing light diffusion rather than stark contrasts.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the ivy tendrils follow logical climbing paths from the window frame and floor, wrapping around the hammer and anvil without crossing through solid parts or appearing suspended in mid-air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no ivy tendrils depicted; rather, the hammer and anvil themselves have transformed into elements consistent with a forest setting. Therefore, the question does not pertain to the scene, as Image B lacks these specific ivy configurations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the transformed anvil and hammer fall consistently with the light source from the window, and do they interact naturally with the wooden table and surrounding tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shifts away from the original indoor depiction to a forest setting, where light sources and shadow play differ, featuring ambient outdoor lighting without visible window influences. Therefore, the consistency of shadows relative to indoor light sources and other tools doesn't apply to this scene.",
