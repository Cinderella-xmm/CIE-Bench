      "question": "Does the broccoli appear structurally consistent and credible as a small real tree without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the broccoli is creatively used as a metaphor for a small tree. The structure of the broccoli head resembles a tree canopy, and the trunk-like stem connects naturally into the ground, mimicking roots. There are no visible artifacts or textures that seem out of place given this creative interpretation, and the broccoli's natural texture enhances the tree-like appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the newly added forest floor support the broccoli as a small real tree in a way that appears physically logical and does not introduce distortions such as broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forest floor is seamlessly integrated with the broccoli. The base of the broccoli stem resembles tree roots spreading into the soil, which supports the illusion of a small tree emerging from the ground. There are no visible distortions or broken shapes, and the textures are consistent with a natural woodland environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the broccoli consistent with sunlight filtering through a forest canopy, without creating unnatural lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the broccoli visually matches the setting of a forest. The shadows and highlights are softly diffused, which is characteristic of sunlight filtering through a canopy. This lighting contributes to the realistic setting and avoids any harsh or unnatural effects that would disrupt the forest ambiance.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the broccoli detailed enough to resemble a small tree trunk, avoiding unnatural smoothing or graininess?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the broccoli in Image B maintains a level of detail analogous to that of tree bark or a trunk. The natural roughness of the broccoli does not appear smoothed out or overly grainy, ensuring it convincingly takes on the guise of a small tree without losing its textural depth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition harmonious, with the forest floor and background convincingly integrating with the broccoli as a tree, without any visual contradictions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire composition is cohesive and supports the intended illusion of the broccoli as a tree. The forest floor, with its earthy tones and natural foliage, complements the broccoli's green colors, merging them into a singular forest scene. There are no jarring contrasts or visual contradictions, ensuring a harmonious overall composition.",
