    "Question": "Q2: Are the blue and gray areas on the plush pigeonâ€™s body evenly colored with soft transitions, and do the feather-like patterns appear as continuous, low-relief designs on fabric rather than sharp, digital lines?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the plush pigeon with areas of blue and gray that transition smoothly, indicative of fabric coloring methods that result in soft transitions rather than abrupt changes.
