      "question": "Do the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal appear to naturally integrate with the warm red and gold hues of the book and pitcher without disrupting the overall color harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Classic LEGO minifigure is designed in the traditional LEGO color scheme with primary colors like blue and red. The mythical animal is represented by the already existing pitcher, which is gold. These elements provide a contrast to the warm red and gold hues of the book and pitcher but don't necessarily disrupt color harmony. Instead, they add a playful and visual contrast to the overall composition without appearing out of place.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and sizes of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal logically consistent with the scale of the book and pitcher, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigure is a recognizable object with a standard size, which complies with the expected small scale relative to the pitcher. The proportions appear logical given that the minifigure is enclosed within a display case with the pitcher, suggesting they are meant to be seen as collectible or decorative items. There is no indication of disproportion or unrealistic scaling.",

      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal maintain a natural and high-quality appearance, free from any unnatural artifacts or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigure maintains its signature plastic material and smooth texture in the edited image. The pitcher remains metallic and reflective, similar to its appearance in the original image. The materials and textures are consistent with expected physical properties of each object, demonstrating clarity and detail without the introduction of artifacts.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube in Image B is a transparent enclosure around the LEGO minifigure and the pitcher. It appears structurally sound, displaying coherent geometric lines and edges. The reflections and transparency properties of the glass are plausible and natural without visual disruption or signs of distortion.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B smoothly transitions from deep amber to soft cream tones. This gradient backdrop builds a warm and cozy ambiance that complements the overall composition without interfering with the visual authenticity or natural appearance of the displayed objects.
