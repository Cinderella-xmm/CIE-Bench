      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character has human-like traits with arms and fingers. The arm is designed in a cartoonish style, meaning it doesn't strictly adhere to anatomical accuracy. The arm and hand have three fingers, which is common in cartoon styles for simplicity and expressive purposes. The connection point of the arm is consistent with this style, and it aligns well with the shrimp body, lacking anatomical distortion. Therefore, the shrimp character's hand does not have five fingers, but it is logically integrated with the character's body style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chef's hat is illustrated in a simple, cartoon style. While there is an indication of shading suggesting a light source from the front, the texture of the hat and creases do not mimic real-world fabric; instead, they are stylized for the cartoon aesthetic. The hat lacks detailed fabric texture or creases and doesn't cast a detailed shadow on the shrimp that would be expected from real materials.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand of the shrimp character is holding a lemon slice. The hand, consistent with cartoon styling, has three fingers, which are spaced and curved in a simple manner fitting the fiction of the cartoon shrimp as a chef. The lemon slice also appears more simplified in shape and texture, fitting the style rather than retaining a realistic wedge shape or detailed surface texture common in real lemons.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, motion lines are used in a cartoon panel to imply movement as herbs are being thrown. These lines are visually emanating from near the shrimp's hands, suggesting the herbs are being scattered. The herb particles themselves are shown traveling in a consistent direction following these motion lines, which aligns logically with the visual narrative of the shrimp tossing herbs.",

      "question": "Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp are depicted in a large pile, but they are part of a cartoon illustration. The shrimp tails are drawn in a way that appears consistent with cartoon physics rather than realistic rendering. While they could be considered visually stable within the cartoon's logic, there is no detailed attention to gravity-consistent layering or overlapping as seen in realistic portrayals.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text elements are integrated into the illustration consistently. They are placed in speech bubbles and header spaces designed not to obscure key visuals such as the shrimp character or the pan. The text is legible with a consistent stroke thickness and style, well-suited for the cartoon aesthetic.",
