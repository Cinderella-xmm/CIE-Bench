      "question": "Does the transformed tapestry gown maintain continuous and coherent fabric folds and draping without visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gown is examined for its fabric folds and draping. The visual cues show a smooth and continuous flow of the fabric without any visible seams or distortions. The draping appears natural and harmonious, indicative of a well-constructed garment, which aligns with common sense expectations of how quality gowns are depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the platinum jewelry pieces (necklace, earrings, bangles) proportionally accurate and free from unnatural glares, misshapen forms, or inconsistent material textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the platinum jewelry is assessed for proportionality and material representation. The visual cues reveal that the necklace, earrings, and bangles have consistent proportions and textures that convincingly mimic platinum. There are no unnatural glares or misshapen forms, suggesting realistic renderings consistent with high-quality depictions of jewelry.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the newly added elements in the background (stars, luminous flowers, lanterns) follow consistent lighting direction and depth cues without creating visual inconsistencies or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features stars, luminous flowers, and lanterns that appear to adhere to a coherent lighting scheme, with each element harmoniously integrated into the scene's depth. The lighting direction is consistent, and elements such as lanterns and flowers are positioned to avoid visual inconsistencies, creating a sense of depth and preventing the illusion of floating objects.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are both hands correctly formed with five fingers each, natural joint alignment, and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are analyzed for anatomical correctness. The visual cues indicate that each hand is properly formed with five distinct fingers, showing natural joint alignment. There are no overlapping or missing digits, demonstrating a realistic and anatomically correct representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the luminous flowers and ethereal lanterns exhibit smooth gradients and soft glows without jagged edges or artificial halos?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous flowers and ethereal lanterns are assessed for lighting effects. These elements appear with smooth gradients and soft glows, devoid of jagged edges or harsh halos. This presentation suggests careful attention to detail, contributing to an ethereal and cohesive visual effect.",
