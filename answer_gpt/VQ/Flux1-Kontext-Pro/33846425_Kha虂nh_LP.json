      "question": "Does the enlarged skirt maintain consistent lace texture and pattern without visible warping, tiling, or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analysis focuses on the lace texture and pattern of the skirt. The lace appears to be consistent in design, with no visible signs of warping, tiling, or unnatural stretching, maintaining a natural flow as it drapes down. The texture seems to follow the contours of the dress without any distortion, suggesting the enlargement is skillfully done.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the enhanced lace details consistent in thickness, spacing, and opacity with the original lace, and do they lack abrupt edges or synthetic-looking overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is analyzed for consistency in lace detailing. The lace appears consistent in terms of thickness, spacing, and opacity, matching the original in Image A. There are no abrupt edges or synthetic overlays visible, which suggests a smooth enhancement that maintains the natural look of the lace.",

      "question": "Do the added structural elements of the camper van conversion (e.g., side panels, windows) follow the car’s existing geometry and maintain consistent scale and perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there don't seem to be any added structural elements like side panels or windows that have been altered from the original image. The car retains its original appearance, indicating there are no modifications present in terms of camper van conversion.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B shows no floral paintings present on the car's surfaces. Thus, issues such as flatness, misalignment, or unnatural shadowing do not apply since such elements are not part of the edited image.",

      "question": "Is the kraft paper texture uniformly applied across the background without obscuring the subject or creating visible seams, and are the nautical borders contained within the image boundaries without cutting into the woman or car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a border and a kraft paper texture that is applied uniformly. The texture does not obscure the subject; it stays in the background without creating visible seams. The nautical borders are clearly contained within the image boundaries, avoiding interference with the woman or the car.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on the woman's dress and car align well with the overhead sunlight source observed in Image A. There are no conflicting highlights or dark spots observed, suggesting consistency with the original lighting conditions.",
