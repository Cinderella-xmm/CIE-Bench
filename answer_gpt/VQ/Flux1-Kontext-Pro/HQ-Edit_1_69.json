      "question": "Does the red dress maintain natural fabric folds and surface texture despite increased saturation and bold outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress appears stylized and exhibits bold outlines which are more prominent in graphical illustrations. While the detail of real fabric texture is lessened due to stylistic choices such as saturation and bold outlines, the folds and overall shape of the dress are still indicative of a natural fabric flow, often seen in depictions of skirts or dresses. These artistic decisions are common in illustrative art where authentic textures are not the focus.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s leg and arm positions consistent with natural human biomechanics during a walking motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the positions of the woman’s legs and arms appear to fall within the usual range of movements seen in a person walking. The right leg is slightly forward, and the arm opposite it (the left arm) swings slightly back, which is kinetically natural for balance during walking. Her stance and limb positioning correspond with common human biomechanics capturing a motion mid-step.",

      "question": "Is the black slipcase visually integrated into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black slipcase that frames the illustrations appears imposed over the scene rather than being a part of it. The lighting and reflections on the slipcase do not match the lighting sources and directions apparent in the scene itself, such as the neon lights of the cityscape. This discrepancy suggests that the slipcase acts more as a border and does not integrate visually with the scene's environment lighting.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bold outlines around the woman’s body follow the natural contours of her shape without creating gaps or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines added to the woman’s form are stylized yet successfully trace the contours of her body without causing gaps or misalignment. These outlines highlight key features such as the curves of her arms and the edges of her dress, maintaining alignment with her natural shape seen in the illustration. This technique is typical in comics or stylized art where outlines are used to define and accentuate shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand have five fingers with natural proportions and smooth skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s right hand features the standard five fingers. While the artistic style does focus more on bold outlines and stylization than realistic texture, the proportions of her fingers are consistent with a natural human hand. There are no extra digits or obstructions that suggest abnormality or deformation, maintaining a visually normal and balanced depiction.",
