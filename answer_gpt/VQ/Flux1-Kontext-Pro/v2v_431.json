      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the keys preserved without distortion after being converted into 3D cartoon-style chibi renditions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keys are depicted with geometric shapes similar to Image A, such as circles, triangles, and rectangular elements. Each key features distinct patterns or symbols, like the Eye of Horus and the cross. In the edited image, these shapes appear smooth and retain their relative proportions from the original, indicating the geometric integrity is preserved, albeit with a stylized chibi form.",
