      "question": "Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase maintains a similar overall shape and proportions as seen in Image A, with a wide body and tapered neck. The surfaces are smooth, indicative of a crystal material, and accentuate the curvature without geometric distortion. The previously ornate ceramic surface has been replaced by transparent crystal surfaces, yet the basic form remains consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal vase in Image B features etched floral patterns that exhibit uniformity and clarity, with no signs of being superimposed or blurred. The patterns are a part of the vaseâ€™s surface texture and maintain crisp detailing typical of etched crystal surfaces, contrasting with the ornamental paintings on the ceramic vase in Image A.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal flowers in Image B retain the original shapes of the blooms found in Image A, characterized by petal structures and arrangement, but now exhibit translucency and internal refraction. They possess soft pastel coloration indicative of crystal or glass, suggesting the material's nature of transmitting and refracting light, unlike solid or opaque objects.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mirrored pedestal in Image B provides a clear, reflective surface that accurately portrays the reflection of the crystal vase and flowers. The reflection is free of distortion, maintaining the proportions and angles of the vase and flower arrangement, indicating a flat and polished surface designed for such clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is handled meticulously to create realistic refraction and internal glow within the crystal elements, offering a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. The highlights are soft and spread across the crystal surfaces naturally, without any harsh or unnatural bright spots or flat shading areas, which reflects how light behaves with such materials.",
