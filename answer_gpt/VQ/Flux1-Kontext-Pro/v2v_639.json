      "question": "Are the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe free from unnatural textures and maintain their structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures of the person and giraffe resemble LEGO minifigures, which are known for their smooth, plastic-like texture and distinct, coherent structure. The textures in the image are uniform, with a glossy finish that matches the typical appearance of LEGO pieces, indicating structural coherence. Based on these visual cues and knowledge of LEGO materials, the figures appear free from unnatural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures appear undamaged and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures, such as the characteristic blocky features and consistent proportions of a LEGO person and animal, appear intact. These shapes are symmetrical and consistent with known LEGO designs, suggesting they are undamaged and structurally sound. No distortions or anomalies suggest otherwise.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosing the LEGO scene look natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass cube is meant to encase the scene, and it appears clear and uniformly shaped without any visible distortions or artifacts. The edges are straight and parallel, maintaining the expected geometric form of a glass display case. The glass looks consistent with cases used to protect and display objects, indicating it is free of obvious artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the lighting in the scene properly highlight the intricate details of the LEGO minifigures and the glass cube without causing any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B illuminates the LEGO minifigures and glass cube evenly without casting significant shadows or causing glare that could obscure details. The minifigures and the enclosing cube are clearly visible, with distinct details that are discernible due to the well-distributed lighting. There are no distortions caused by the lighting effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the scene's earthy and natural tones without introducing unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gradient background is subtle and maintains a neutral tone that does not clash with the earthy colors of the LEGO minifigures. The background is smooth and free of distracting textures or color inconsistencies, allowing the viewer to focus on the minifigures without any loss of detail that might occur with an overly complex background.",
