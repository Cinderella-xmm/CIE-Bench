      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its structural integrity with no signs of distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parking meter in Image B appears consistent and coherent in structure, displaying no visible signs of warping, distortion, or odd textures that would suggest editing flaws. The surface of the meter, its shape, and the labeling are all clear and appear realistic. This indicates the editing has preserved the parking meter's integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transition between the parking meter and the new desert highway background smooth and devoid of visible edges or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter appears smoothly blended with the new desert highway background. There are no visible outlines or mismatches in color and lighting at the junction of the meter and the background, suggesting a seamless integration without visible editing marks that would normally indicate two distinct images merged together.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting effects on the parking meter match what would be expected in a desert setting under bright sunlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and lighting on the parking meter in Image B align well with the conditions typical in a desert scenario under bright sunlight. The light source seems to cast consistent and natural shadows as would be expected with the high sun position often found in such environments. The highlights and shadows on the meter do not appear out of place or mismatched with the assumed position of the sun.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any irregular or unnatural shapes in the desert landscape that seem out of place or disrupt the scene's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a desert landscape that looks uniform and typical of such environments, with distant hills and sparse vegetation forming a consistent backdrop. There are no irregular or oddly-shaped objects that stand out or seem unnaturally integrated into the setting, maintaining the authenticity of the landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parking meter appear naturally placed in the desert highway setting without looking misplaced or awkward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the parking meter itself is well-integrated into the desert highway setting in terms of blending and shadows, its presence is somewhat unexpected in such a location. Desert highways typically do not have parking meters, suggesting its placement is contextually unusual even though it visually aligns correctly.",
