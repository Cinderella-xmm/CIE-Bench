      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass display case surrounding the aircraft appears to have smooth, clear surfaces. The reflections and transparency are consistent with what one would expect from a well-maintained glass surface. There are no visible distortions, scratches, or unnatural reflections that would suggest any imperfection in the display case's material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leather accents and brass corners on the display case have realistic textures and demonstrate an appropriate response to the lighting in the scene. The materials appear securely attached, with no seams or floating effects that would indicate a rendering fault or misalignment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the engraved emblem on the front of the display case is clearly defined and shows depth through appropriate shadowing. However, the emblem is on the wooden base of the case, not the glass surface, thus eliminating the need for it to blend into the glass, which was a misunderstanding in question wording. Nevertheless, it appears naturally integrated into the wooden base with realistic texture and lighting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature clouds inside the glass case are clearly positioned separately from the aircraft. The textures of the clouds appear soft and volumetric, consistent with real clouds. There is no evidence of clipping or unnatural transparency, suggesting a realistic and coherent rendering of cloud elements within the case.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the propellers are shown with rotational motion blur, which gives a sense of motion consistent with an operational aircraft. They are correctly aligned with the engine nacelles, and there are no visible signs of deformation or clipping against the display case, indicating an accurate representation of the aircraft's dynamic components.",
