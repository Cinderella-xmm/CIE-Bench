    "Question": "Q1: Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous panels appear to be seamlessly integrated into the structure of the object, following its shape and curvature without any visible gaps or seams. The neon lighting outlines create a smooth and continuous appearance, indicating careful alignment with the original surface shape. This is consistent with a high-quality digital enhancement where panels are expected to fit well onto existing surfaces.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "The neon animations on the digital panels in Image B are sharp and continuous, with light patterns that do not show any pixelation or fragmentation. The neon lines and patterns appear crisp and clearly defined, which suggests that the digital effects are applied with high resolution and precision, maintaining smooth transitions and consistent light output.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the synthetic foliage emits a soft, even glow, with individual plant forms showing defined structure and depth. The lighting effects on the foliage enhance the three-dimensional appearance of the plants, making them look realistic and not flat. This is achieved by careful texturing and lighting to mimic depth and volume in a digital context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
    "explanation": "The metallic surfaces of the buildings in Image B display accurate reflections and subtle surface variations. The light reflects realistically without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures, suggesting a high level of detail and care in the rendering process. Such detail ensures the reflection behaves in a realistic manner, suitable for a nighttime cityscape as seen in the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed head and pedestal are aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings. There is no visible angular distortion or perspective mismatch; everything appears proportional and coherent with the environment established by the buildings and the horizon line. This alignment ensures that the modifications to the structure fit seamlessly into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
