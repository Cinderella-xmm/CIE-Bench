      "question": "Are the paws of the husky significantly larger than natural proportions but still maintaining smooth, rounded shapes without distorted edges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paws of the husky plush toy do appear larger than typical proportions you'd expect from a real husky, as it's common for stuffed animals to have exaggerated features for aesthetic purposes. The paws are smooth and rounded, clearly indicating they are made from fabric, with no signs of distortion or broken geometry. The plush paws are intentionally designed for a pleasing, cartoon-like appearance, which is consistent with the common design choices for stuffed animals.",
