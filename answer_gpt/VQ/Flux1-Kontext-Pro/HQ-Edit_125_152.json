      "question": "Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wingâ€™s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monarch butterfly is depicted flying over a garden with flowers. The orange sections of the butterfly's wings do not show visible sheet music patterns, and the natural vein lines remain intact without distortion or texture artifacts. This conclusion is drawn from examining the wings closely, which appear to maintain their natural texture and form.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, the antennae of the butterfly appear to extend naturally from the head with smooth, continuous curves. They do not show unnatural kinks, breaks, or seem disproportionate in length compared to typical monarch butterfly antennae. This assessment is based on comparing the antennae's appearance with the common characteristics of butterfly anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals of the surrounding flowers are shaped like regular flower petals and do not mimic musical notes. They retain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals. This judgment is made by observing their form and comparing it with real-world flowers, noting that any musical notes depicted are separate and floating, not integrated into the petal shapes themselves.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a central butterfly surrounded by flowers arranged symmetrically and artistically, creating a visually balanced composition. The arrangement allows for plausible distances and angles for each element, contributing to an overall harmonious garden scene. This conclusion is derived from evaluating the spatial distribution and aesthetic layout of the elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the title text rendered with smooth, continuous strokes and no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B, 'Monarch's Garden Symphony,' appears to be rendered with smooth, continuous strokes, with no visible aliasing or jagged edges. This conclusion is reached by examining the text's clarity and smoothness, typical of high-quality typography in digital illustrations.",
