      "question": "Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy's head appears slightly enlarged, while the birds appear more compact compared to typical proportions seen in photographs. The arrangement retains structural coherence without noticeable distortion. The birds, although smaller in proportion, sit naturally in alignment with the shoulders and head, maintaining a believable interaction between the boy and the birds due to their positions and relative sizes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the block colors used for the boy's skin tone and feather textures appear clean and uniform, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B utilizes block coloring, simplifying textures and tones. The boy's skin tone and the feather textures are rendered in a uniform, cartoon-like style with clean and defined colors, avoiding the introduction of unnecessary artifacts or noise. This style is consistent with simplified digital illustrations where detail complexity is reduced for stylization purposes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the white outlines around the boy and birds smooth and consistent, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white outlines in Image B are smooth and uniformly encircle the boy and birds. They provide clear separation from the black background and enhance the stylized aesthetic, maintaining consistent width and shape without jagged edges or interruptions, which suggests careful digital enhancement to maintain visual clarity.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the birds, although simplified, retain essential detail like their shapes and coloring pertinent to their species. The transition to a stylized format reduces realistic textures for illustration purposes. However, they do not appear pixelated or excessively blurred; details pertaining to their identities, such as color patches, remain visible, providing clarity required for recognition.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition with the enlarged boy's head and shrunken birds appear balanced and neatly arranged, providing visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a deliberate arrangement where the head is the focal point, and the birds are proportionately smaller yet strategically positioned to maintain visual balance. The birds are distributed symmetrically around the boy's shoulders, creating a harmonious composition that appears credible in a stylized context, avoiding overly crowded or awkward positioning.",
