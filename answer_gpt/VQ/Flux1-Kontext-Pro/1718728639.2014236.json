      "question": "Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armorâ€™s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tesserae on the chest and torso are arranged in a manner that follows the contours and curves of the armor. The tiles are uniformly sized and placed, maintaining a consistent pattern that mirrors the structural design of the armor. There are no visible breaks or misalignments present, indicating a well-executed mosaic arrangement. This observation leads to the conclusion that the tesserae are flawlessly integrated into the armor's design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the left and right wings symmetrically styled with ornate feathers, and do they maintain natural layering and curvature without unnatural bends or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are symmetrically styled; both the left and right wings feature ornately designed feathers that mirror each other. The feathers exhibit a natural layering and curvature, matching the elegant style typically associated with such wing designs. No unnatural bends or gaps are observed in the feather placement, which suggests a consistent and symmetrical appearance of the wings.",

      "question": "Does the celestial dome background appear to surround the figure without visible edges, color bleeding, or inconsistencies in lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial dome background is designed to surround the figure seamlessly. The background color and pattern are consistent and integrate smoothly with the elements of the image, without any noticeable edges or color bleeding. The lighting direction appears unified, enhancing the aesthetic of a complete and harmonious setting around the figure. This reflects careful compositional design.",

      "question": "Are the mosaic patterns on the crown and neckpiece aligned with the original shape, symmetrically placed, and free of distorted or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mosaic patterns on the crown and neckpiece are aligned precisely with their original shapes. The symmetry of the patterns is maintained, ensuring a balanced and harmonious look. No distorted or missing sections are apparent, highlighting the attention to detail in the placement and design of these elements. This ensures the crown and neckpiece appear complete and polished.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the gold and azure colors used consistently across the armor, wings, and crown, with matching reflectivity and no abrupt transitions between materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold and azure colors can be observed consistently across the armor, wings, and crown. The reflectivity of these colors is uniform, not showing any abrupt transitions between different materials or areas. The color coordination suggests a fluid and well-thought-out use of color palette throughout the image, ensuring visual harmony across all elements.",
