      "question": "Do the carrots and soil maintain their texture and detail, appearing natural against the Arctic background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots appear vibrant and well-textured with a smooth, shiny surface, and the soil looks rich and clumpy. This indicates a high level of detail and realism. The combination of these elements with the Arctic background, which is unusual for such a scene, does not inherently affect the texture and detail of the carrots and soil themselves. Thus, the carrots and soil maintain their texture and detail despite the unusual context of an Arctic background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any visible artificial or unnatural textures where the Arctic background meets the soil and carrots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, there does not appear to be any harsh lines or mismatched textures where the soil and carrots meet the Arctic background. The blending looks smooth, suggesting that the textures transition naturally without visible artificial or unnatural interruptions. This suggests the editing was done with attention to preserving visual consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the carrots retain their proper size and shape relative to the snowy landscape in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carrots appear proportionally consistent in size and shape relative to typical carrots. While the snowy landscape is an unusual background, it does not distort the relative size of the carrots when considering their visual scale against the foreground soil and assumed proximity. They maintain a realistic vegetable size compared to the landscape.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transition between the soil surrounding the carrots and the Arctic background appear seamless and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from soil to the Arctic background does not show any visible seams or distortions. The soil leading into the icy landscape looks natural and cohesive, suggesting careful attention was given to blending these different visual elements without noticeable disruption.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the snow and icebergs in the background crisp and free of degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Observing Image B, the snow and icebergs in the Arctic background appear clear and defined, maintaining their crispness. This suggests that the photograph or editing preserved the quality of these elements without introducing blurriness or noise, ensuring they appear sharp and detailed in the context of the image.",
