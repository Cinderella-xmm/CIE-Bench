      "question": "Does the holographic dragon eye on the watch face exhibit smooth gradients and consistent lighting without pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural glow artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the holographic dragon's eye on the watch face appears detailed with smooth gradients and consistent lighting. The detailing of the holographic effect implies a professional digital rendering. There is no apparent pixelation or jagged edges, which are often signs of poor image quality. Furthermore, the glow around the eye appears intentional and artistic, avoiding unnatural glow artifacts that would detract from its appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the silver scales on the band evenly aligned, properly shaded, and free from gaps or overlapping segments that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the silver scales on the band are aligned in a manner that suggests careful design and manufacturing. The shading appears consistent across the scales, which gives the illusion of depth and metallic texture. There are no visible gaps or overlaps, indicating that each scale is in its proper place and maintains the geometric continuity of the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glowing neural node on the side of the watch case properly integrated with the casing, showing consistent illumination and no unnatural light leakage or distortion in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing neural node is considered to be integrated smoothly into the side of the watch case. The illumination is consistent, and there are no signs of light leakage or distortion. Such artifacts would typically display as uneven lighting or shape irregularities, which are not present in this case.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear boundaries and consistent brightness levels without blurring or ghosting around their edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the luminescent control sigils on the watch face maintain clear, sharp boundaries with consistent brightness. There is no evidence of blurring or ghosting, which would appear as an unwanted halo or duplicate lines around the sigils, indicating a high-quality image edit.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all components of the watch—case, band, crown, and side button—proportionally aligned and structurally coherent without visible warping, stretching, or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, all components of the watch, including the case, band, crown, and side button, appear well-proportioned and aligned. There are no indicators of warping, stretching, or misplacement, which would present as noticeable deformities or size discrepancies among the components. Everything appears to be coherently integrated, which suggests a meticulously crafted design.",
