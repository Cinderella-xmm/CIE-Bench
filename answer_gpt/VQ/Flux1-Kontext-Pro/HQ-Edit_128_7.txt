    "Question": "Q1: Do the swirling cloud-like structures integrated into the tower maintain consistent geometric continuity without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the swirling cloud-like structures around the tower are visually smooth and continuous, integrating seamlessly with the overall design without any visible breaks or jagged edges. The artistic design reflects a continuous flow, typical of well-rendered cloud formations. Thus, they maintain geometric continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the luminescent runes aligned with the wood grain and carving details, and do they emit light without creating unnatural halos or pixelated edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the luminescent runes appear to be well integrated with the wood grain and carvings, providing a natural alignment with the architectural details. The light they emit is soft and does not produce any harsh halos or pixelation, which suggests a smooth transition in lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the shimmering crystal spires reflect light naturally, showing subtle variations in transparency and surface highlights consistent with real crystal under daylight?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the spires as shimmering with light reflections and variations that mimic real crystal under daylight conditions. These spires have subtle highlights and transparency that are consistent with how crystal structures interact with light, providing an authentic and realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the glowing celestial orbs centered and securely attached to the tips of the spires, maintaining proportional scale and alignment with the architectural axis?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible glowing celestial orbs that are centered and attached to the tips of the spires. Hence, there is no basis for assessing their alignment or proportional scale with the architecture.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the silver spiral trees maintain three-dimensional volume and proper shadowing, appearing solid rather than transparent or two-dimensional?",
    "explanation": "The trees in Image B appear as stylized yet solid forms with three-dimensional volume and appropriate shadowing, conveying a sense of solidity. They do not seem transparent or flat but are rendered with a clear volume that is consistent with a three-dimensional interpretation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the ghostly bird apparitions semi-transparent with smooth feather outlines and consistent motion direction, without fragmented or duplicated body parts?",
    "explanation": "The bird apparitions in Image B have a ghostly and semi-transparent quality, with outlines that are smooth and consistent. They seem to be in directed motion, and there are no indications of fragmented or duplicated body parts, maintaining a coherent depiction of flying birds.",
    "answer": "Yes"
