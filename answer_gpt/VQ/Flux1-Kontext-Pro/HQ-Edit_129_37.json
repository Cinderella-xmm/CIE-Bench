      "question": "Does the glass container maintain the original circular shape and proportions of the compass body, with no warped edges or irregular thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass container appears to maintain the circular shape and proportions of the compass body. The edges are smooth, with no visible warping or irregular thickness, consistent with the common design objective to replicate or maintain the original shape in such edits. This preservation of shape is an indicator of careful editing applied to maintain cohesiveness.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the spray nozzle centered within the glass container, aligned with the pivot point of the original needle, and does it have a smooth, continuous metallic surface without jagged edges or textural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible spray nozzle present within the glass container. The compass design is integral, appearing as a complete object without any additions such as a nozzle that would indicate conversion into a bottle. Hence, I see no evidence of alignment or surface details that would involve a nozzle.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the cap feature a detailed engraving of a vintage map that is evenly distributed across its surface, with no blurred lines or inconsistent depth, and is it attached seamlessly to the top of the glass container?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "For Image B, although the cap features some engraving, it does not appear to be a vintage map, nor is there detail that would distribute evenly across its surface. The engraving is not intricate enough to be described as a map, suggesting a more simple design was chosen. The cap appears to be attached seamlessly, but without the map engraving as described.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the bronze gradient applied smoothly across the glass container and cap, with subtle variations in tone that simulate wear and light reflection, and no sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bronze gradient seems to be smoothly applied over both the container and cap. The tone exhibits subtle variations simulating wear and light reflection, which are typical effects used to enhance realism in photo edits. No sharp color boundaries or artificial sheen are observed, indicating skillful application of color gradients.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the branding text visible along the outer rim of the glass container, with consistent font size and spacing, and does it appear embedded into the surface without overlapping or floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is visible text along the outer rim of the container. The font size and spacing appear consistent across the text. The text seems embedded into the surface rather than floating above or overlapping, which is a characteristic of professional-grade design work ensuring text appears naturally integrated.",
