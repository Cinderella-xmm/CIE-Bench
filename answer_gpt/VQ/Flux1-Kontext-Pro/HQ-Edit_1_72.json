      "question": "Are the gold embellishments on the Dashiki naturally integrated into the fabric, showing realistic reflective properties and no floating or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold embellishments on the Dashiki appear to be well-integrated into the fabric. The patterns have realistic reflective properties, indicating they are part of the garment rather than just floating or having pixelated edges. This suggests an attention to detail in the texture and integration of the pattern within the fabric.",

      "question": "Do the beads and symbols on the shoulders align correctly with the shoulder anatomy and exhibit natural material textures without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the beads and symbols are observed to align satisfactorily with shoulder anatomy and maintain a natural appearance. The textures of the material are clear, and there is no apparent distortion or misalignment, suggesting a realistic portrayal of these elements as part of the clothing.",

      "question": "Are the Acacia trees in the background proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, with natural branching patterns and no visible geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Acacia trees are proportionally accurate and structurally coherent, displaying natural branching patterns. There are no visible geometric distortions, and they fit well within the landscape, maintaining a realistic representation.",

      "question": "Does the wild grass in the foreground and midground display natural variation in height, color, and orientation, avoiding repetitive or tiled patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wild grass exhibits variations in height, color, and orientation, avoiding the appearance of repetitive or tiled patterns. This gives the grass a more natural look, enhancing the overall realism of the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both hands are depicted with five fingers each. The joint alignment, skin texture, and shading appear natural and consistent with the rest of the figure, suggesting an accurate and realistic portrayal of the hands.",
