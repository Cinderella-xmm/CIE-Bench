    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO-style bricks on the building facade uniformly sized, aligned in rows, and free from visible texture repetition or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facade of the building appears to be constructed from LEGO-style bricks. These bricks are expected to have uniform sizes and alignment, characteristic of LEGO structures. Upon examining the facade, the bricks do appear uniformly sized and aligned in consistent rows as is typical for LEGO. There is no notable texture repetition or blurring present, suggesting a clean and precise construction expected from a LEGO representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Do the window frames appear as solid, blocky LEGO elements with consistent thickness and alignment, matching the original window positions and sizes?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows window frames that should be solid, blocky LEGO elements. These frames appear to maintain consistent thickness and alignment throughout the facade. The positions and sizes of the windows align closely with their original counterparts, maintaining proportional integrity and spatial arrangement as expected with LEGO structure adherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the green LEGO vines grow along the same vertical paths as the original plants, maintaining segmented, blocky forms without stretching or breaking continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green vines that are LEGO interpretations should follow the same vertical paths as the original vines. Upon inspection, the LEGO vines maintain the segmented, blocky form characteristic of LEGO structures. They follow the original plant paths without any stretching or breaks in continuity, accurately reflecting the original plant's layout.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Are the gray LEGO railings on each balcony evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and securely connected to the balcony base without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gray railings on each balcony should be evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and properly attached to the balcony base as is typical for LEGO constructs. The railings do appear evenly spaced and correctly aligned horizontally. There are no visible instances of floating or improper overlapping, indicating that they are securely connected to the balcony.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a flat, level platform extending beneath the entire building base, positioned consistently with the sidewalk and not overlapping with parked vehicles?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a LEGO-style building where a flat, level platform should extend beneath the building base. This platform appears consistent with the sidewalk level and without any overlaps with parked vehicles, which are nonexistent in this image. The platform provides a stable foundation typical for LEGO creations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do all architectural elements—including windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—remain in their original positions and maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to one another?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, it is crucial that the architectural elements such as windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines stay in their documented original positions. These elements in Image B match their original counterparts in Image A, with proper alignment and spacing. The positions are consistent relative to each other, maintaining the integrity of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders between the LEGO building and the sky, trees, or parked cars?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the transition between the LEGO building and its background (e.g., sky, trees) is seamless. There are no visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges that would indicate an issue with the integration of the building into its surrounding environment. The image appears clean and well-constructed, typical of a professional alteration.",
    "answer": "No"
