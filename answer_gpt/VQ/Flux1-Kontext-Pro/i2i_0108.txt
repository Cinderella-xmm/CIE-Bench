    "Question": "Q1: Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character appears to be stepping out of the television screen, specifically with the lower part of the body crossing the screen boundary. Based on visual cues from Image B, the outline and textures along the screen's boundary look fairly seamless and do not display artifacts or abrupt edges. The transition from the TV screen into the real space is smooth and convincing. This suggests careful editing, maintaining natural textures and avoiding obvious signs of manipulation.",
