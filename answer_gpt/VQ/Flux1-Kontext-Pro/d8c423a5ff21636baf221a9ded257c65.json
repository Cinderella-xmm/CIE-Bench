    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's head-to-body ratio is exaggerated in comparison to natural human proportions, which is characteristic of stylized figures like dolls or animation characters. Despite this exaggeration, the structure of the head remains coherent without warping or misalignment of the facial features. This can be determined from the absence of any uneven angles or distorted anatomy which suggests the structural coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, consistent porcelain-like surface with no rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress is portrayed with a smooth, consistent surface resembling porcelain. It doesn't show any rough texture, visible artifacts, or unnatural reflections as would be expected on a three-dimensional doll's clothing, implying well-maintained surface quality.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the lamb positioned naturally within the lap, consistent with three-dimensional, detailed forms that show volume and soft texture, which would typically be used for realistic miniature sculptures. The lamb rests within the hand naturally without signs of clipping or appearing as if it floats above the surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base beneath the figure appears to be aligned correctly with the foreground. It integrates into the background without creating shadows that contradict the light source, nor does it give the impression of floating or disconnect with the background.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the eyes proportionally enlarged but symmetrically placed, with no distortion in shape or spacing relative to the nose and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Evaluating Image B, the eyes are proportionally larger, typical for a stylized doll. Despite this, the placement is symmetrical, and there is no distortion in the shape or spacing, maintaining coherent facial structure regarding the nose and mouth.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's hands each have five fingers. They are depicted with natural alignment at the joints, with no errors like extra or missing digits, which shows skill in maintaining realistic hand anatomy within the figure's construction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the necklace and pendant are detailed and visible, displaying a consistent texture that mimics metal. There are no signs of pixelation or blurring around the edges indicating successful rendering of jewelry detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a background that maintains vertical seamlessness and color integrity. The smooth integration reflects the original gradient of the sky, horizon, and mountain silhouette, ensuring no visible seams or unnatural color shifts disrupting the background composition.",
