      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear consistent and natural, following the typical pattern seen in real-life zebras. The stripes curve naturally around the contours of the zebra's body, without any visible breaks or disjointed lines that would suggest editing errors or unnatural formations. This consistency indicates that the patterns have been well-represented.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are positioned upright, consistent with the natural posture usually observed in zebras. The ears do not show any signs of distortion, unnatural bending, or strange angles. This suggests that the ears are represented authentically without any editing artifacts affecting their appearance.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's body, including its limbs and torso, appears to maintain realistic proportions. The legs are straight and appropriately sized relative to its body, and the overall silhouette of the zebra is consistent with how these animals naturally appear. There are no exaggerated or distorted features that suggest any disproportion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's coat exhibits a smooth texture. The stripes transition naturally across the body without pixelation or artifacts, indicating high image quality and careful editing, if any. This smoothness enhances the realistic appearance of the zebra.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surrounding grass looks natural and does not exhibit any clear signs of alteration or editing artifacts. The texture, color, and distribution of the grass are consistent with what would be realistically expected in a natural setting, and there are no visible anomalies or disruptions.",
