        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black-and-white facial pattern accurately represented by distinct dark and light wood tones along the central vertical line of the face, with no smudging or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black-and-white facial pattern is represented by dark and light tones of wood, following the central vertical line of the face. Although the face is blurred, the visible parts of these tones suggest a distinct separation without smudging or misalignment in the areas that can be seen.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features—such as the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth outline—accentuated with fine, realistic carved lines that enhance depth without distorting proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blurring on the face prevents a detailed inspection of the facial features. However, the visible parts such as around the ears and sides of the face display fine carvings that suggest quality craftsmanship. Due to the blur, a full assessment of distortion or proportion alignment of these specific features is not possible.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all body parts—head, ears, legs, and paws—maintain smooth, rounded contours consistent with the original form, without flattened areas or sharp edges that suggest poor carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the body parts visible exhibit smooth, rounded contours that are consistent with a quality wood carving. The ears, legs, and paws lack any flattened areas or sharp edges, indicating skilled workmanship and careful carving.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is positioned on a minimalist wooden platform that matches the color and texture of the figure. The platform appears flat, providing good grounding for the dog figure. The lighting and shadows seem consistent, contributing to a realistic appearance of the platform and the sculpture.",
