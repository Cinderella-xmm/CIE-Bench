      "question": "Do the restored areas of the clock tower seamlessly integrate with the original stone texture, avoiding any visible seams or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower's surface appears consistently textured, without visible seams or distinct patches that would suggest recent restoration work. This indicates that the integration of new and existing materials was well executed, maintaining the unity of the stone texture across the tower. The examination focuses on the stonework around the edges and joins, looking for uniformity in color and texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and shapes of the restored sections, such as the arches and clock face, consistent with the rest of the tower, avoiding any distortions or irregularities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions and shapes of the arches and clock face in Image B appear harmonious and in line with the rest of the tower. The arches remain symmetrical and the clock face is circular without irregularities, suggesting careful restoration work. This assessment involves checking for symmetry and uniformity in architectural features, which are consistent in this image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the fine details, such as cracks and weathering patterns, been accurately replicated in the restored sections, preserving the historical look without losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the restored sections display fine details such as cracks and weathering patterns that blend well with the rest of the tower. These details match the existing aging signs, supporting the historical continuity of the structure. The analysis included close inspection of the join areas and surfaces for consistent aging textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the restoration work enhance the tower's completeness, making it appear as though it was never damaged, while preserving its architectural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a complete and well-preserved tower without apparent signs of previous damage. The restoration aligns with the architectural style, maintaining both the form and aesthetics of the original design, which indicates a successful enhancement of the tower's completeness. This involves evaluating the towerâ€™s overall structural unity and aesthetic continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the restored sections exhibit the same lighting and shadow effects as the original parts of the tower, contributing to a natural and cohesive appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting and shadows on the restored sections are consistent with the lighting on the original parts. The shadows and highlights enhance the stone textures and contribute to a cohesive look, suggesting that the lighting consideration was part of the restoration effort. This involves assessing whether the play of light and shadow is seamless across the entire structure.",
