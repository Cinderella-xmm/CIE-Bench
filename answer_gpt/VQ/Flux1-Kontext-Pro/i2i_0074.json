      "question": "Do the added text elements such as titles and headings appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or disrupting the surrounding design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'IDEAL HOME' and other text elements are added over the image of a bedroom. They are positioned and sized effectively so as not to interfere with the image's main components—such as the painting and other decor elements—by maintaining an unobtrusive presence. There are no visible signs of texture clashing or unnatural overlays that would disrupt the room's harmonious design, suggesting seamless integration.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and placements of the newly added text elements appropriate, ensuring they do not distort the geometric shapes or disrupt the room’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B shows that the text elements are placed strategically to align with the natural geometry of the room, such as being parallel to the ceiling line for the title and having a balanced alignment for lower text items. This ensures that they fit within the image without distorting any existing structures or altering the visual perception of the room's layout.",

      "question": "Does the style and material used for the text modules match the room's decor, maintaining a cohesive look without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is presented in a clean, modern font, which complements the contemporary decor style of the room, characterized by minimalist design and natural wooden elements. The choice of font and color (white) does not clash with the room's subtle, calming color palette, making the text integration appear cohesive and well-suited to the overall aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the magazine cover design elements, when placed over the bedroom image, seem visually credible and avoid unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B makes an effort to apply magazine cover elements in a manner that appears natural and credible, with no apparent artifacts. The text and layout do not introduce visual noise or block critical features of the underlying image. This aligns with common practices in magazine design, which prioritize visual clarity and coherent integration of text over imagery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details within the added text elements (titles, headings, and price recommendations) preserved, ensuring their clarity and legibility without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in Image B, although smaller in the lower part, remain clear enough for legibility. There's no visible blurring or pixelation in the text that would indicate degradation. This clarity suggests that the text has been added with high resolution, maintaining its legibility across various sizes.",
