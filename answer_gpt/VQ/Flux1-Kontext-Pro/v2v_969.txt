    "Question": "Q1: Do the chibi-style 3D figures inside the snow globe maintain the correct proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the features inside the snow globe appear to be chibi-style figures of baseball players. Despite being encapsulated in the globe, the proportions of the figures remain consistent with typical human anatomy in chibi form, which is characterized by having larger heads compared to body size and exaggerated traits. Although this stylized depiction inherently alters proportions, it achieves a consistent, intended aesthetic without implying unnatural distortion, as the chibi style is universally recognized for its specific proportions.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the light layer of snow on the grass inside the snow globe appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow is represented as a fine layer at the base of the snow globe surrounding the chibi figures. The texture is uniform and smooth, which fits the typical visual form of artificial snow often found inside globes. The snow layer blends naturally with the scene without revealing any irregularities or digital artifacts, consistent with crafted snow globe aesthetics and intended presentation rather than realistic landscape snow capabilities.",

    "Question": "Q3: Does the snow globe rest naturally on the rustic wooden shelf with soft sunlight filtering through, creating believable warm, golden reflections?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the snow globe placed on a wooden shelf, indicating the spherical surface of the globe reflects ambient light. The lighting within the image is subtle, suggesting soft sunlight permeates the area, lending warm reflections depicted on the snow globe surface. These reflections match the typical light interaction with transparent and reflective objects, endorsing authenticity within this display context.",
