      "question": "Are the feathers on the headdress evenly distributed and symmetrically placed without appearing warped or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers on the headdress appear to be evenly distributed and symmetrically placed. Each feather appears uniformly spaced, which suggests careful design to maintain balance and symmetry. There is no visible warping or misalignment that would disrupt the design or visual coherence, indicating a well-arranged headdress.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the details on the shoulder armor and neckpiece exhibit intricate and consistent woven patterns, displaying precision in craftsmanship. There are no visible seams or obvious texture repetition, which suggests a high level of detail and uniformity. The patterns look seamless and maintain a natural appearance.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the necklace stacked in a way that follows gravitational and structural logic, with no turquoise elements appearing suspended or disconnected from the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the layers of the necklace are arranged in a way that logically follows gravitational and structural principles. Each layer of the necklace lies on top of the other without causing any turquoise elements to appear suspended or detached. This suggests that the necklace is anchored and designed cohesively.",

      "question": "Do the warm tones applied to the headdress, textiles, and jewelry match the lighting conditions and skin tone without creating unnatural color casts or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the warm tones used on the headdress, textiles, and jewelry complement the overall lighting conditions and skin tone. They blend harmoniously without causing unnatural color casts or overly harsh shadows. This even distribution of tones creates a consistent and visually appealing image.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids and earrings are clearly visible and appear intact. There is no evidence of distortion, such as stretching or clipping, and they do not appear unnaturally separated from the head or ears. This suggests a realistic and well-integrated design.",
