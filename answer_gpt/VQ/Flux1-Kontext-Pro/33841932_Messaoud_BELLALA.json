      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the bookmark version of the central golden curved skyscraper maintain a smooth, continuous curve without broken or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarks are assessed to represent buildings or skyscrapers. For the central golden curved skyscraper, which is represented as a bookmark, the focus is on whether the contours are smooth and continuous. The bookmarks, being metallic and etched, are likely designed with precision, so any broken or jagged edges would suggest a manufacturing flaw. Based on the image, the curved edges are defined, maintaining their smoothness without any perceivable breaks or jagged lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the sharp angles and vertical lines of the angular black skyscraper bookmark clearly defined and geometrically consistent without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookmarksâ€™ design includes geometric elements such as sharp angles and straight lines. Evaluating the sharpness and integrity of these features indicates the quality of the etching process. The vertical lines are generally clear, and the angles appear well-defined, maintaining consistency without distortion, suggesting that the design integrity has been preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the horizontal steps of the stepped golden building bookmark remain distinct and evenly spaced without merging or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's stepped golden building bookmark, which mimics a building with horizontal steps, should clearly present these steps without overlapping or merging, as these would suggest issues with the design. The bookmarks show these steps in a distinct and uniform manner, indicating no merging or uneven spacing.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vertical lines and window patterns on the rectangular high-rise bookmark aligned and evenly spaced without warping or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rectangular high-rise bookmark, intended to represent a building, features vertical lines and window patterns. These elements should be consistently spaced and aligned to maintain the design's visual integrity. Examination of the image shows that these lines and window patterns are indeed aligned and evenly spaced without warping, maintaining design consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the gold and silver glazes on the bookmarks show consistent reflective highlights without scattered noise or unnatural glittering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic bookmarks in Image B have a natural reflective quality due to their material. The reflective highlights should appear smooth and consistent. The image suggests that these highlights are present without any scattered noise or unnatural glittering, showcasing the material's reflective properties authentically.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the etched outlines on all bookmarks continuous, unbroken, and aligned with the edges of the shapes without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Etched bookmarks typically feature precise outlines that align with the overall shape. Any floating or incorrectly intersecting outlines would imply design or etching errors. The outlines in Image B appear continuous, unbroken, and well-aligned with the edge of the bookmarks, indicating high etching quality.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the bookmarks positioned on the book with correct perspective and shadows that suggest they are resting on a flat surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows metallic bookmarks placed on a book. The perspective and shadow rendering gives a realistic representation of the bookmarks resting on the surface. The shadows and the perspective are consistent with a realistic view, not suggesting any floating or unrealistic overlap.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Are the stars and wave doodles drawn in a consistent cartoon style and placed within the margins of the book without overlapping the bookmarks or appearing misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The doodles of stars and waves in Image B should exhibit a consistent artistic style, complementing the bookmark placement without overlap or alignment issues. The doodles do not infringe upon the bookmarks, staying within the margins, which preserves their cartoonish style and maintains visual harmony.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, visual artifacts like jagged edges or ghosting would suggest flaws in the image capture or editing process. Upon examining the image, the transition between the bookmarks and the book appears sharp and clean, with no visible artifacts such as jagged edges or color bleeding, ensuring a visually clean presentation.",
