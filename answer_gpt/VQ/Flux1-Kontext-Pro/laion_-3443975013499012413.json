      "question": "Do the crystal facets on the fish's body follow the natural curves and scale patterns of the original wooden carving without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal fish sculpture is crafted with facets and reflects the light, enhancing its appearance. By analyzing its structure, the facets appear to be carefully aligned with the natural curves of the fish's body, as they emphasize the circular motion and scale pattern that mimic a real fish. When examining Image A, the original wooden carving, the natural wood grain and precise carving also follow these curves closely. Both images show attention to detail in highlighting the natural curves, indicating no geometric distortion in the crystal version.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy surfaces of the crystal fish uniformly reflective and free from abrupt texture changes or matte patches that break the illusion of fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a crystal sculpture that is uniformly glossy, likely due to polished facets that reflect light consistently. The entire surface maintains a continuous glossy appearance that supports the illusion of fluidity. There are no abrupt changes or matte textures visible that disrupt this continuum. Image A does not have such reflective properties, as it is made of wood and has a more muted and natural texture. Thus, the crystal fish in Image B maintains a smooth and reflective surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spiral shape of the fish preserved in the crystal version, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal fish maintains a coherent spiral shape that reflects a precise crafting process. The alignment of the head, body, and tail follows a consistent circular path, showing careful work in preserving the overall design. Image A possesses the same spiral shape in its wood carving; both images align in terms of proportion without any visible stretches, compressions, or misalignment between segments.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the mirrored pedestal beneath the crystal fish reflect the sculpture accurately, with no visible distortions or missing reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not show evidence of a mirrored pedestal; instead, the crystal fish sculpture rests on a white plinth, which lacks reflective properties to display a mirror-like image of the sculpture. While the shine of the crystal would presumably create interesting reflective effects, the absence of a mirrored pedestal means that there is no reflection present to evaluate. Therefore, the question of reflection cannot accurately be applied here.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures clearly preserved in the crystal version without fading or smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal fish maintains a high level of detail, most likely due to precise crafting techniques that emphasize features such as gill lines, fin textures, and the eye area. These details are not softened or faded despite being rendered in crystal, suggesting a high quality of workmanship to preserve such nuances. In comparison, Image A showcases these details clearly in wooden form, and Image B seems to preserve these intricacies in its crystal rendition.",
