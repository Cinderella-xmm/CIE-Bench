      "question": "Does the monocle added to the tortilla chip maintain a consistent size and shape relative to the chip, and is it seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monocle on the tortilla chip is consistently sized and appears proportionate to the chip. It is well integrated, as the placement and dimensions of the monocle align naturally with the contours of the chip, avoiding any visual artifacts or unnatural shading. The monocle's curvature and orientation are congruent with the position of where a monocle would typically rest, and the shading is consistent with the light source and shadows present in the surrounding environment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound proportionally sized and shaped like a realistic hand, with no more than five fingers and natural joint lines, and does it appear to emerge naturally from the guacamole without breaking its texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand-like appendage on the guacamole mound in Image B appears more cartoonish rather than realistic but is proportioned appropriately with four fingers. The 'hand' lacks realistic joint lines and instead resembles a stylized puppet hand, integrating seamlessly with the guacamole's texture in a manner typical for animated characters. Despite its unrealistic appearance, it emerges naturally from the guacamole without disturbing the texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the spice rack positioned behind the tortilla chip in a way that respects perspective and shadow direction, and does it blend naturally with the existing background without visible seams or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spice rack is positioned and angled correctly according to the roomâ€™s perspective and light source, suggesting an understanding of spatial alignment. The shadows and lighting on the spice rack are consistent with those on surrounding objects, ensuring a natural blending with the background without any visible seams or mismatches in color. These details help maintain coherence and visual integration into the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mini flag banners aligned horizontally and evenly spaced above the table, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the light source, without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mini flag banners in Image B are not only evenly spaced and horizontally aligned above the table but also show visual consistency with the light source. The addition of subtle shadows under the flags gives depth and three-dimensionality to the scene, preventing the appearance of being flat or artificially inserted. This attention to detail supports the natural and realistic portrayal in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole been adjusted to pastel shades without losing their inherent textures or becoming unnaturally pale or washed out, maintaining visual credibility as edible items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of both the tortilla chip and guacamole do not seem adjusted to pastel tones. Their color remains consistent with natural hues appropriate for edible items, as seen in their original context. The textures are well preserved, retaining their realistic appearance without becoming unnaturally pale, washed out, or losing their credibility as food items.",
