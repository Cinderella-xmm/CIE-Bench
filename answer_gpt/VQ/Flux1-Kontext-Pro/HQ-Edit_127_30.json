      "question": "Does the transformed violin body maintain consistent surface texture and lighting behavior with a high-quality engraved case, without unnatural sheen or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin is placed within a high-quality case that has a rich red velvet interior and a dark exterior. The lighting on the violin is consistent with the lighting on the case, creating a harmonious visual appearance. There is no noticeable sheen or texture mismatch between the violin surface and the surrounding case materials. The surface texture of the violin body appears smooth and glossy as expected for a finely crafted instrument, and the lighting highlights the wood grain effectively without looking artificial.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold accents on the chinrest and tailpiece seamlessly integrated with no visible seams, unnatural reflections, or color bleeding into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin does not show any visible gold accents on the chinrest or tailpiece. Instead, these parts appear to be a dark color, likely black as is common for violin fittings. Therefore, there are no considerations regarding seams, reflections, or color bleeding of gold accents as these elements are either non-existent or not modified.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the scripted font along the strings clearly legible, aligned with string curvature, and free from distortion or floating effects that suggest digital overlay errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no visible scripted font along the strings of the violin itself. The only script visible is on the interior lining of the case where it says 'Tyth Trac'. This script is not located along the strings nor is it aligned with any string curvature. Additionally, there are no signs of distortion or floating effects related to this script, indicating no digital overlay errors for this particular feature.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the newly designed pedestal stand have proportionally correct legs and decorative elements that match the vintage aesthetic without appearing undersized, misaligned, or structurally unstable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal stand on which the violin case rests appears to be a richly carved wooden table with cabriole legs consistent with a vintage aesthetic. The decorative elements are proportionate and match well with the overall design, suggesting a robust and stable structure. There are no indications of the legs being too small, misaligned, or of instability in its structural design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the key structural components of the violin—such as the f-holes, bridge, and scroll—still present in accurate positions and proportions relative to each other, even after modifications?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the violin retains its characteristic features, such as the f-holes, bridge, and scroll, all of which are in their traditional positions and appear proportionally correct relative to each other. The modifications in the edited image do not compromise the structural integrity or the traditional positioning of these components.",
