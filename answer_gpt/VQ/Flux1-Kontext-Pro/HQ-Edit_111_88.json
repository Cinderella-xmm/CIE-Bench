      "question": "Does the dancer’s raised leg and arm maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment despite the stylized design, with no visible geometric distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s pose is stylized, yet retains a proportionate and anatomically plausible configuration. The arm is curved elegantly, avoiding any sharp angles or abnormal twists, and the leg is raised in an arc that mirrors natural human movement, aligning with a sense of fluid dance motion. The lack of geometric distortion implies adherence to natural proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the dancer’s dress and accessories composed of smooth, continuous lines and uniform color segments without jagged edges or fragmented areas indicating texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the dancer’s attire with vibrant, intricately designed patterns that are continuous and coherent. The lines forming the patterns are smooth, creating an unbroken visual flow, and the color segments are consistent in their tones without irregularities or abrupt texture shifts, indicative of a smooth rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the huts and trees in the background exhibit smooth, curved forms consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics, without distorted silhouettes or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the huts and trees demonstrate elegant, curving lines typical of Art Nouveau style. The silhouettes are coherent and stable, avoiding any signs of distortion or irregular collapse. The forms maintain a natural, flowing appearance, enhancing the aesthetic harmony of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color gradient across the sky and ground consistent with a soft, iridescent glass effect, showing no harsh boundaries or artificial highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky and ground in Image B feature a subtle gradient that transitions smoothly across the image. There are no abrupt color changes or harsh lines that disrupt the visual continuity. The effect simulates a soft, iridescent glass, contributing to a gentle, blended aesthetic across these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the cloth display five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does it interact realistically with the fabric without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s hand is depicted with five clearly distinguishable fingers, each spaced naturally and curved in a realistic manner. The interaction with the cloth appears authentic, as there is no visual anomaly such as clipping through or levitating from the fabric, indicating a realistic depiction of movement and contact.",
