      "question": "Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass dome is visually clear and smooth. The light source, which is the lantern inside, allows for even illumination without noticeable distortions in the glass. There are no cracks or refraction patterns that could suggest irregularities, which indicates a well-maintained glass dome. The clarity allows for a clear view of the lantern and the miniature scene within. Thus, the glass dome maintains the expected properties of transparency and smoothness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceramic street pavements underneath the glass dome are represented with miniature tiles. These tiles are uniformly sized and maintain clearly defined edges, supporting an accurate diorama representation. The color transitions between tiles are also smooth and visually pleasing without any evident blurring or misalignment. This indicates careful craftsmanship or editing attention to detail.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature figures and canopies in Image B are crafted or edited to appear proportionate to the lantern, emphasizing their scaled-down nature. The figures exhibit realistic shapes and textures for miniature models, and the canopies are depicted with natural looking fabric drape. There is no obvious duplication or unnatural blending with the surrounding elements, maintaining coherence in their placement and scale.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees in Image B are well detailed with properly shaped fronds that match common miniature representations. Their bases appear rooted in the model scene, and their shadows are consistent with the light source emanating from the lantern. The trees are convincingly integrated into the scene, giving a sense of dimensionality and solidity without looking detached or flat.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the dome in Image B appears textured with a realistic, weathered finish. There are subtle tonal variations that imply depth and material age. The surface does not exhibit any artificial uniform patterns or visible digital artifacts, which suggests careful processing or editing to maintain a natural aesthetic. This attention to detail contributes to the overall authenticity of the scene as a miniature model.",
