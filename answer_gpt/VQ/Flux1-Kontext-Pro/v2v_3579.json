      "question": "Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged to resemble a human figure, with a head, torso, arms, and legs. The sushi pieces are neatly arranged, and they appear connected without visible gaps or distortions. Each part of the human figure is constructed coherently, maintaining structural integrity. This indicates careful placement for achieving continuity and a clear representation of a human shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces in Image B hold colors similar to those in Image A; these include shades of orange, green, and white, typically seen in sushi. There is uniformity in the use of colors, maintaining consistency with the original sushi map without introducing unnatural color changes. This reflects meticulous editing to sustain color integrity in transitioning from a map to a human representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces in Image B display clean, distinct edges, providing a clear-cut representation without any visible blurring or pixelation. This suggests high-quality editing where maintaining detail and clarity in the shape of the sushi pieces for the figure has been prioritized, making them look sharp and well-defined.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sushi pieces in the human figure in Image B resemble those in Image A in terms of size and shape. The dimensions appear natural with consistent proportioning, suggesting a thoughtful transformation from an irregular map form to a uniform human figure form. The shapes are maintained without seeming stretched or compressed, indicating adherence to realistic proportions.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arm is raised to mimic an anatomical position for a greeting or waving. The sushi pieces align in a manner that allows for natural bends consistent with human anatomy, avoiding unnatural positioning. The arrangement reflects an understanding of physiological plausibility, ensuring the arm looks natural without awkward or abrupt angles.",
