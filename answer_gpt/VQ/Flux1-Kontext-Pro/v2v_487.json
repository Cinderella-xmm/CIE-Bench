      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style figure appear to seamlessly emerge from the kayak without any visible breaks or unnatural intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi-style figure inside the kayak looks naturally integrated. The body and paddle are proportionate to the kayak's size, and the interactions between them appear smooth and coherent. There are no visible breaks or unnatural intersections between the figure and the kayak, indicating a seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts present around the edges where the chibi figure meets the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The image shows smooth transitions where the chibi figure meets the kayak, particularly around the hands and paddle area. The rendering of the figure and kayak does not reveal any noticeable artifacts or unnatural textures that would suggest editing inconsistencies. This indicates a clean integration without visual errors.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the chibi figure relative to the kayak appear realistic and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style of the figure is characterized by slightly exaggerated proportions—such as a larger head—but within the context of its style, the figure fits appropriately within the kayak. The proportions do not seem off or inconsistent with the structural elements of the kayak, indicating a well-maintained proportionate design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph holding the scene appear naturally integrated into the overall composition without any distortion or unnatural placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Polaroid photograph held by the hands appears correctly proportioned and placed within the scene. The alignment of the photograph with the background, and the depiction of the scene within it, do not exhibit distortions or misalignment. The hands grasp the photograph naturally, contributing to a coherent overall composition.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the materials and textures of the kayak and skateboard remained consistent and undistorted after the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining both images, it's noted that the textures and materials of the kayak and skateboard maintain their consistent appearance. Despite the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame, no distortion or alteration occurs, suggesting that these additions have not impacted the structural integrity or visual consistency.",
