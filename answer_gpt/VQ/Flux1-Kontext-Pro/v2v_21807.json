      "question": "Are the clock faces and architectural details of the tower clearly visible and structurally consistent despite the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock faces and architectural features of the tower are depicted with clear lines and defined shapes, maintaining structural consistency despite the cartoon style. The cartoon representation is simplified but captures the essential features and proportions of the original tower, such as the clocks and the general architecture, ensuring recognizability and structural consistency.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the clock tower and surrounding elements retain their natural textures without any noticeable loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon style inherently simplifies textures by using flat colors and outlines, which does not maintain the natural textures seen in real images. The details that convey texture, such as the surface material and small intricate details, are minimized or omitted to fit the cartoon aesthetic, resulting in a noticeable loss of the original texture details.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the edited image avoid introducing any unnatural artifacts or distortions in the clock tower and its surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, while rendered in a cartoon style, does not introduce unnatural artifacts or distortions in the portrayal of the clock tower and its surroundings. The shapes and lines all appear purposeful and clean, fitting the cartoon medium without blemishes or irregular artifacts, ensuring the image remains visually coherent and undistorted.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical relationships between the clock tower and its surroundings logically maintained in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions and spatial relationships between the clock tower and its surrounding environment appear logically preserved in Image B, even within a cartoon context. Although simplified, the size and placement of the tower relative to the road, cars, and trees maintain realistic relationships, ensuring a coherent spatial depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the clock tower and its surroundings remain intact and undistorted in the cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric shapes of the clock tower and its surroundings are maintained accurately, with clear and intact outlines. Despite the cartoon style, which simplifies details, the fundamental shapes, such as the rectangular and arch elements of the tower, remain true to the original form without distortion, ensuring visual consistency.",
