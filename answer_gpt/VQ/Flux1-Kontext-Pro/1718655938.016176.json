      "question": "Are the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls clearly defined and geometrically consistent, without broken or warped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is drawn with clean and clear outlines, typical of a cartoon or stylized illustration. The lines are straight and even, without any broken or warped edges, which is typical for hand-drawn or digital artworks focusing on consistency and simplicity. The shapes are geometrically consistent with the rest of the architectural style depicted.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stained-glass windows display clear, coherent patterns with smooth color transitions and no pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stained-glass windows have been illustrated with distinct, bright colors that blend smoothly from one to another. The lack of pixelation or jagged edges suggests that the windows are drawn with attention to detail typical of smooth digital art, offering a clear, coherent pattern that matches the overall aesthetic of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the candy-like tree replacements composed of smooth, continuous shapes with consistent surface textures, and do they maintain plausible proportions relative to the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the trees are depicted with smooth, rounded shapes and consistent texturing which gives a candy-like appearance. These trees fit well within the stylized environment and proportionally match the church size, appearing neither too large nor too small in comparison. This suggests an intentional artistic choice to represent them in a whimsical manner.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the patchwork quilt sky feature uniform stitching lines and consistent color blending between patches, with no visible seams or sharp discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sky is depicted as a swirl of vibrant colors with smooth transitions between different shades. The lines within the sky are not meant to represent actual stitches but rather an impressionistic swirl, which blends naturally and seamlessly. There are no visible seams or sharp discontinuities present, indicating consistent blending.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the light sources from the church windows cast consistent, soft shadows on the surrounding grass and path, matching the direction and intensity of the internal glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the windows are brightly lit indicating internal light, the illustration does not show explicit shadow casting on the grass and path as it would be found in more realistic interpretations. The cartoonish style lends itself to focus more on artistic representation rather than realistic light physics, suggesting an intentional omission of detailed shadows. Thus, there are no inconsistencies because the style supports a more abstract approach.",
