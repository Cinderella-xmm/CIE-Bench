    "Question": "Q2: Are the facial features on the transformed tree trunks (left and right sides) geometrically coherent and smoothly integrated into the bark texture without visible seams or distortions?",
    "explanation": "The facial features on the transformed tree trunks appear to be geometrically coherent and smoothly integrated into the bark texture. This is evident from the way the facial elements blend with the natural tree surface, showing continuity in texture and alignment without any visible seams or distortions that could disrupt the illusion of facial features emerging from the bark.",
