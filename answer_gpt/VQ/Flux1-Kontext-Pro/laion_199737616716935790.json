      "question": "Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle body panels feature black and blue brick-like textures that appear to be consistent with the angular design typically found in such graphic designs. The alignment and geometry are crucial for maintaining the intended visual appeal and design concept. A careful inspection of Image B suggests that the textures are applied consistently along the angular lines of the panels, matching the expected design patterns.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rims in Image B have a cog-like pattern, which would typically require the circular shape of the rims and the even spacing of the teeth to remain consistent with the wheel diameter. In the detailed view of the rims in Image B, they appear to maintain an even circular shape, and the teeth are evenly spaced without any noticeable distortion, stretching, or breaking.",

      "question": "Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the decals on the motorcycle are vibrant and colorful, and their seamless integration into the surface is essential for a realistic appearance. Upon inspection, the decals appear to be smoothly applied onto the surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or signs of unnatural layering, which implies that they are indeed seamlessly embedded.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycleâ€™s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gray baseplate in Image B functions as the platform supporting the motorcycle model. Upon examining the baseplate, it is observed to be flat and continuous, and there is no visible elevation mismatch or distortion affecting the way the motorcycle's wheels rest upon it. The base appears to adequately support the motorcycle, maintaining a realistic presentation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the focus is mainly on the motorcycle and base; however, there is no visible display case encapsulating the model, suggesting that there may be no such case present in the image. Therefore, any observation regarding boundaries, ghosting, refraction, or shadows is not applicable. This suggests that there is no interference by a display case.",
