    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned and proportionally consistent with each other, without any visible stretching or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The question about facial features is not applicable as the face has been blurred. Therefore, we cannot assess the alignment, proportionality, or presence of distortion in the facial features.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hair appear voluminous and fluffy with natural strands and flow, without flat patches or artificial layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair appears to be voluminous and fluffy, with distinct strands that give a natural and flowing appearance. There are no visible flat patches or signs of artificial layering. Typically, such characteristics are identified by the presence of varied texture and shadows within the hair, indicating a three-dimensional volume.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the black vertical stripes on the sweater rendered as continuous, evenly spaced stitches without jagged edges or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the black vertical stripes on the sweater appear well-defined, maintaining continuity and even spacing along the fabric. The absence of jagged edges or gaps suggests that the pattern is rendered smoothly, which is a typical characteristic of high-quality textile designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the body shape uniformly rounded and soft, without sharp edges or irregular protrusions that would disrupt the plush appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body shape in Image B appears uniformly rounded and soft, consistent with the characteristics of a plush item. No sharp edges or irregular protrusions are visible, which aligns with the expected plush appearance, typically characterized by smooth, seamless curves.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the transitions between the fur of the hair and the fabric of the sweater smooth and consistent, without visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition between the hair and the fabric of the sweater appears smooth and consistent, indicating a well-executed integration between different textures. This seamless transition avoids any abrupt change or mismatch in texture, which would be noticeable and detracting from a cohesive appearance.",
