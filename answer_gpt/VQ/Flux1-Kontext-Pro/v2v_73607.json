      "question": "Does the royal linen garment with leopard motifs retain the natural texture and pattern of the original leopard print top without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the garment has been transformed into an Egyptian royal linen garment. The intricate patterns of the leopard print have been replaced with traditional Egyptian motifs. The transformation aligns with the style of ancient Egyptian clothing, focusing on symmetry and balance rather than the irregular, natural pattern of leopard print. Therefore, the original leopard print has not been retained, opening up room for visual artifacts due to the shift in style.",
