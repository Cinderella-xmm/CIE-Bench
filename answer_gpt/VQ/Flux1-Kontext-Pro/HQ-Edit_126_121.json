      "question": "Are the gorilla's hands holding the bananas with five fingers each, and do the fingers have natural curvature and skin texture without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorillaâ€™s hands appear to have a realistic texture with a natural curvature expected for gorilla hands. The hands show five fingers each, and the fingers present a natural, realistic appearance fitting the furry skin texture and form of a gorilla. World knowledge regarding primate anatomy supports that gorillas typically have five fingers, including opposable thumbs, which aids in holding items like bananas.",

      "question": "Does the edge of the cereal box blend naturally with the gorilla and background, without visible seams or lighting discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cereal box edge integrates smoothly with the image, maintaining consistent lighting and color schemes that match the rest of the scene. This implies a seamless transition between the gorilla image and the cereal box, without noticeable seams or lighting changes, suggesting a well-executed transition in image editing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the green and yellow colors on the cereal box consistent with the lighting and tone of the jungle environment, without abrupt shifts or oversaturated patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green and yellow tones of the cereal box correspond harmoniously with the ambient lighting and the tones used in the jungle background. The hues are vivid but not overly saturated, and there are no abrupt transitions, maintaining a coherent visual continuity with the environment depicted around the gorilla.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the banana motifs and leaf patterns on the box have realistic shadows and depth, matching the lighting direction of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The banana motifs and leaf patterns on the cereal box in Image B are detailed with shadows that create a sense of depth, aligning with the lighting direction of the scene. The shadows enhance the three-dimensionality of these elements in accordance with the jungle theme, indicating careful attention to lighting and shadow during design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the back panel illustration maintains a correct perspective and scale relative to the rest of the box, ensuring that it does not detract from the main visual elements, namely the gorilla and the bananas. The text is properly aligned and legible, with careful placement to prevent obstruction of crucial imagery, which reflects thoughtful composition and prioritization of visual elements.",
