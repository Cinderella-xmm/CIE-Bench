    "Question": "Q1: Is the head disproportionately large compared to the body but without stretched or compressed facial features?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is styled in a chibi form where the head is intentionally larger in proportion to the body. This is a common design choice in chibi figures to emphasize cuteness and does not result in stretched or compressed features visually. The smooth transitions from the head to the body ensure the aesthetic remains consistent with chibi design conventions without presenting distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly visible and proportionally accurate despite the enlarged head?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the face is blurred and hence not in a suitable condition for evaluating facial features. Normally, if the image were clear, chibi figures would have facial features that are designed to fit their unique design, with large eyes and simplistic style. However, due to the blurring, it was not possible to assess this aspect.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Do the stripes on the shirt maintain consistent width, alignment, and color accuracy across the collar and chest area?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the stripes on the shirt are consistently spaced and maintain their width, color, and alignment, which is typical of stylized figure designs. This provides a pleasing visual consistency over the shirt's different areas, aligned with standard manufacturing quality for plastic figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the surface of the figure appear smooth and reflective, with no visible texture artifacts or rough edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the figure appears smooth and glossy, characteristic of high-quality plastic figures. There are no visible rough edges or texture artifacts, suggesting a well-finished production surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the background a uniform pastel color with no gradients, shadows, or blending artifacts near the figure's edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a solid pastel pink color, which is uniform and lacks any gradients or shadow effects. This is ideal for maintaining focus on the figure and enhances the photo's clean aesthetic by ensuring that the background remains distraction-free.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the facial expression more animated than the original (e.g., wider eyes, open mouth) but still anatomically consistent and not distorted?",
    "explanation": "The facial detail in Image B is blurred, preventing the evaluation of any expressive details. Normally, chibi figures feature exaggerated but anatomically consistent expressions; however, due to the lack of visible clarity, this aspect cannot be assessed.",
    "answer": "No"
