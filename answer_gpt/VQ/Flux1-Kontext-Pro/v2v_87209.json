        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owls are surrounded by smooth, sinuous lines and botanical motifs characteristic of an Art Nouveau style which is known for its flowing lines and integrated nature-inspired elements.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
