    "Question": "Q1: Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe's edge appears smooth and continuous, as expected for a high-quality glass object. There are no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation, which indicates a seamless circular design typical of snow globes. Such smoothness suggests a well-edited or naturally derived photo with a focus on presenting the globe's spherical aesthetics, aligning with real-world expectations of glass manufacturing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a snow globe with reflections and refractions on its surface that mimic realistic light interactions with clear glass. The subtle bending of the scene and the presence of soft highlights are indicative of how light typically reacts to rounded, clear surfaces. These effects enhance depth and create realism in the photo, showcasing careful attention to editing that mirrors real glass behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figures inside the snow globe have accurately proportioned limbs and postures. The people walking on the Great Wall, visible through the globe, have no signs of distortion such as extra fingers or missing arms, which would point to editing errors. This realistic portrayal suggests careful digital work or a high-resolution photograph that maintains the original proportions seen in life-like imagery.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the integration of autumn-colored leaves into the surrounding green vegetation appears smooth, with color transitions that mimic natural scenery changes. Unlike blocky textures or abrupt shifts that would signal poor digital overlay, the seamless blend suggests either natural photography capturing the seasonal change or adept editing that respects the subtleties of real-world vegetation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows snow particles in a dynamic manner indicative of swirling patterns common in snow globes. These particles do not obstruct the view of the Great Wall or figures inside the globe, allowing them to be clearly visible. This balance suggests an accurate representation of snow globe behavior where the scene within remains distinguishable amidst minor snow particle movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
    "explanation": "Image B features ceramic birds positioned above the Great Wall, identifiable by their defined wings and bodies. Their placement in the air, without physical connection to the Wall or other surfaces, aligns with common depictions of flying objects in both artistic and realistic renderings. This positioning helps maintain the fantasy or thematic aspect of snow globes where small objects hover above ground level.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q7: Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden base is portrayed as dark and textured with realistic wood grain. It supports the snow globe steadily, showing no signs of floating or tilting, indicative of a solid, grounded construction. The engraved text 'Great Wall Memories' is clearly legible, reflecting accurate craftsmanship typical of high-quality souvenir items.",
    "answer": "Yes"
