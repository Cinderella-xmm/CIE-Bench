      "question": "Does the leaf inside the snow globe maintain its natural shape and texture without any visible distortions or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the leaf is encapsulated within a clear sphere, resembling a snow globe. The leaf's natural veining and shape are clearly visible, without any apparent distortions or unnatural artifacts. The leaf retains its original structure, reflecting a genuine, untouched state, thereby indicating that the editing process preserved its natural appearance.",

      "question": "Are the snowflakes around the leaf inside the snow globe visually plausible and do they enhance the scene without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small, white particles surrounding the leaf in Image B are reminiscent of snowflakes or air bubbles. They are distributed evenly and do not interfere with the leaf’s visibility or create any unnatural spatial disruptions. These particles enhance the winter or mystical theme of the snow globe, adding to the aesthetic without creating unnatural textures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the gentle ripples in the water around the leaf inside the snow globe look natural and do they maintain the structural integrity of the leaf?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water's gentle ripples surrounding the leaf are consistent with how water would naturally appear within such a setting. These ripples do not distort the leaf or its reflection remarkably inside the sphere, which suggests that the water effect was skillfully crafted to mimic realistic conditions, maintaining the structural integrity of the leaf.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the snow globe rest naturally on the tabletop with realistic reflections and refractions, contributing to the overall visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the snow globe resting on a tabletop, with reflections and light refractions that are consistent with how light interacts with a glass surface. These effects give the impression that the snow globe is physically present in its environment, enhancing the visual credibility. The reflections also appear logical and well-positioned, contributing to a cohesive visual integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the softly blurred background with warm tones free of any unnatural artifacts and does it harmoniously blend with the snow globe scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a background with a shallow depth of field and warm lighting. The blurring effect is smooth and uniform, without noticeable artifacts that could distract from the focal point—the snow globe. This background complements the warm, cozy aesthetics of the foreground, providing an atmospheric scene that harmoniously blends with the snow globe.",
