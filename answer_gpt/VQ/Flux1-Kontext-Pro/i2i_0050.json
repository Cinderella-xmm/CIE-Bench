      "question": "If motion trajectory lines were added around the horse, would they appear naturally integrated with the environment without disrupting the image's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is standing on a beach with an ocean and houses in the background. Motion trajectory lines typically represent dynamic movement, and adding them to the standing horse might disrupt the calm scenery, making the overall image appear less authentic to its peaceful natural setting. The lines could seem artificial and incongruous with the tranquil environment. Therefore, the motion trajectory lines would likely not integrate naturally.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "If a skater was added near the house in the background, would the scale and perspective match the existing scene correctly, maintaining structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background shows houses at a considerable distance from the beach where the horse stands. A skater added near the house would need to be much smaller in scale due to the depth and perspective inherent in this setting. Given that the primary subject, the horse, is in the foreground, any new element placed further away must adhere to this perspective. Without adjusting for depth and distance, the skater might appear disproportionately large or small, disrupting the scene's scale and perspective.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "If the skater's three motion phases were imposed over the sea and land, would the transitions between these phases look smooth without introducing artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is on a plain white background, while the horse and landscape depict a natural environment. Placing the skater's motion phases over the landscape, which has varying textures of water and sand, could result in visual discontinuities. Such an overlay might lead to noticeable transitions and artifacts, given the differing textures and colors. The variance between the natural environment and the relatively uniform background of the skater could disrupt the smoothness of phase transitions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Would the details of the horse's fur texture and the surrounding grass remain visually coherent and undistorted after adding the skater's motion trajectory?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse's fur and surrounding grass in Image B provide visual texture and depth to the natural scene. Adding a skater's motion trajectory over this setting could introduce visual noise and distract from these natural details. Particularly, if the trajectory intersects the horse or grass, it could distort these textures, making them appear less coherent. Therefore, adding these trajectories would likely affect the visual coherence of these elements.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "If the skater's starting motion frames were placed in this scenic setting, would the composition maintain balance and coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is composed of a natural beach environment with serene elements including the horse, sea, and distant houses. Introducing a skater, especially with motion frames, could clash with the tranquil atmosphere and natural composition. The dynamics of a skater's movement could appear too modern or dynamic for the rural coastal backdrop, throwing off the scene's visual balance and coherence.",
