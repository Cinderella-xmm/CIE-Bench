      "question": "Does the 3D chibi cat maintain the natural shape and proportions of its ears and eyes without any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi cat representation features exaggerated and stylized elements typical of chibi designs, such as larger-than-life eyes and prominent ears. This contrasts with the natural proportions of a real cat, which typically has smaller eyes in relation to the face and typically proportionate ear size. While this style is intentional for aesthetic reasons, it shows visible distortion compared to a realistic cat's appearance.",

      "question": "Are the fur texture and other fine details of the cat accurately represented in the 3D chibi character without any loss or unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi cat in Image B is presented in a simplified, cartoon-like style, which includes smooth surfaces and a lack of intricate fur texture details. Such designs intentionally focus on simple shapes and minimalistic features, which results in a lack of realistic fur texture and other nuanced cat details.",

      "question": "Do the bold linework and delicate textures on the cereal box design accurately reflect the cat's fur and eyes without any inconsistencies or unnatural appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box design in Image B employs bold linework and simplified art styles typical of commercial illustrations. This design choice involves the use of smooth, clear lines and regions of flat color, which are inherently different from the complex texture of actual fur but consistent with the stylistic goals of such packaging art, rather than aiming for natural fur representation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a realistic and balanced kitchen setup with the cereal box placed logically on a countertop. The proportions and elements within the kitchen environment make sense visually, contributing to an overall coherent and plausible scene without glaring inconsistencies or unnatural placements.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the cereal box in Image B uses sophisticated color schemes and stylized design elements that are often associated with high-end branding. Furthermore, the chibi cat style adds a playful aspect to the brand identity, achieving a balance between refined and playful aesthetics without any disruptive visual inconsistencies.",
