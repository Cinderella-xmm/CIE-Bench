    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi version of the woman have a proportionally enlarged head relative to the body, with limbs and torso scaled down appropriately without deformed joints or elongated limbs?",
    "explanation": "In the edited Image B, the chibi style is typically characterized by an enlarged head compared to the body, which is a common feature to accentuate cuteness. The limbs and torso appear appropriately scaled down, maintaining a smooth and rounded shape, without any elongated or deformed joints, suggesting that the chibi aesthetics are adhered to. This contrasts with Image A, where the proportions are realistic.",

    "Question": "Q4: Is the modified chair still identifiable as a chair with four legs and backrest, scaled down proportionally and colored vividly without broken geometry or missing parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chair is identifiable as a piece of furniture with a backrest and is colored vividly, fitting into the chibi proportion reduction style. Nevertheless, the visibility of four legs isn't confirmed from the perspective shown. However, based on the typical chibi representation and remaining visible elements, it is reasonable to conclude the integrity of the design is maintained. Contrastingly, Image A shows a realistically proportioned chair.",
