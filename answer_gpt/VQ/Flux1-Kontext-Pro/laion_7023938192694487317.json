      "question": "Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the torso is mounted on a circular base, consistent with a bust or figurine design. The anatomical features such as the shoulders, neck, and waist appear proportionate and appropriately sized for such a figure, without signs of warping or stretching. The consistency suggests the editing aimed to maintain realistic anatomy.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base beneath the torso is round with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective qualities, indicative of polished metal. Its connection to the torso appears designed for the purpose of display, typical of collectible or display figurines, suggesting that it is physically attached but clearly delineated as a separate component.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred and therefore cannot provide specific details about the facial features, the junction between what can be seen and the torso in Image B looks consistent with how heads are attached to busts or figurines and does not exhibit any noticeable blending artifacts or unnatural transitions.",
