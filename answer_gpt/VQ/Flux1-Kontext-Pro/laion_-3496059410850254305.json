      "question": "Does the outline of the guitar body remain intact and undistorted after being converted into an armored torso?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar body is held by a character, resembling an armored hero. Despite its positioning, the outline of the guitar body appears to remain consistent and intact, preserving its original shape rather than being distorted into the form of an armored torso. Since the discernible outline matches the typical form of a guitar, it hasn't been deformed to resemble armor directly.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the metallic finish applied to the guitar body consistent with the original wood grain pattern, showing no signs of artificial texture tiling or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar retains its original wood grain pattern visible through the guitar body, and there are no noticeable changes suggesting a metallic finish. The appearance does not show any metallic reflections or texture inconsistencies that would imply an artificial application over the wood grain.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the illustrative lines evenly spaced, continuous, and aligned with the guitar's curvature without overlapping or cutting through structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The illustrative lines representing the guitar body in Image B appear evenly spaced and continuous, aligning well with the guitar's natural curvature. They do not overlap or cut through the guitar's structural elements, maintaining an aesthetic consistency with the curvature of the guitar body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the strings appear as continuous, taut muscle strands that follow the bodyâ€™s contour without kinks, gaps, or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitar strings seem to remain in their natural orientation without depicting characteristics of muscle strands. They appear intact as typical guitar strings, showing no visible kinks, gaps, or segments floating away from the continuity expected in guitar strings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the cape extend naturally from the neck, showing smooth folds and consistent sound wave patterns along its length without abrupt changes or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cape in Image B extends from the character, not directly from the guitar's neck, implying a more stylized addition. The folds and pattern do not appear to align with sound wave motifs directly and are artistically rendered to show movement, although they do appear smooth without abrupt breaks.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both images, the headstock displays an emblem, which appears correctly aligned and visible in Image B. It does not overlap with the tuning pegs or the brand name, maintaining its original placement and visibility as seen in the original guitar image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at the junctions between original guitar parts and added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B reveals that the guitar is smoothly integrated with the character without evident pixelation, color bleeding, or sharp discontinuities at junctions between parts. The visual elements are blended well, producing a cohesive image without disruptive artifacts.",
