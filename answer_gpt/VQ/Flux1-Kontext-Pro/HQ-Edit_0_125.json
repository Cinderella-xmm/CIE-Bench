      "question": "Does the woman’s face maintain symmetrical features with proportionate eyes, nose, and mouth, and does her hair flow naturally without unnatural bending or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a blurred face, making it impossible to evaluate symmetrical features or proportionate facial elements. However, the analysis of the hair flowing naturally without unnatural bending or clipping indicates that the image editor attempted to keep the hair realistic-looking even though specific face evaluation cannot be conducted due to the blur effect.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the gold-embossed floral patterns on the robe evenly distributed, aligned with the fabric folds, and free from pixelation or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold-embossed floral patterns appear consistently applied along the robe, with the designs effectively following the natural folds of the fabric. The application seems to be precise without noticeable pixelation or edges that appear separate from the fabric, suggesting a high-quality edit.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the red lanterns emit a soft, consistent glow that illuminates nearby areas without creating harsh halos or unrealistic light leakage onto the woman’s robe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red lanterns in Image B appear to provide a soft glow. However, as the setting is not realistically represented alongside other light sources visible in a market environment (like in Image A), there are no harsh halos or obvious unnatural light leaking onto the robe. The visual effect is consistent with creating a serene atmosphere without overpowering highlights.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background rendered as a uniform cream paper texture with faint month grids and floral patterns matching the robe’s design, without overlapping or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B is rendered with a uniform cream paper texture. The month grids and subtle floral patterns align with the robe's design without any overlay issues or misalignment, contributing to a cohesive and neat presentation of the calendar theme.",

      "question": "Are the calendar grid lines and month labels positioned in a way that follows the floral patterns of the robe without causing misalignment or breaking the continuity of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid lines and month labels are strategically placed to integrate with the floral patterns on the robe, effectively preserving the continuity of the overall design. The attention to detail ensures no apparent disruption within the design layout, providing a unified visual experience.",
