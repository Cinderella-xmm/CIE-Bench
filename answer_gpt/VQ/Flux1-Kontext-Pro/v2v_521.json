      "question": "Does the retro-style stove maintain its structural consistency without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the retro-style stove is depicted with smooth lines, consistent coloring, and a lack of visible artifacts or distortions. The knobs, oven door, and overall design align with the expected appearance of vintage appliances. The metal textures on the stove's surface appear natural and coherent, consistent with retro kitchen aesthetics. Therefore, the structural integrity and aesthetic of the stove are indeed consistent.",

      "question": "Is the retro fridge depicted with a natural appearance, free from any obvious artifacts or unnatural blending with the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a retro fridge with a uniform color and smooth surface, reflecting typical characteristics of vintage appliances. The edges are clean, and the interaction with surrounding kitchen elements is seamless, suggesting a natural blending. The fridge handle and metallic accents appear naturally integrated without distortions or alignment issues. Consequently, the fridge maintains a natural and artifact-free appearance.",

      "question": "Do the wooden utensils exhibit a natural wood texture and appearance, without any signs of unnatural artifacts or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden utensils show a consistent wood texture and grain pattern that aligns with real wood materials. The curvature and shading are consistent with a natural presentation, and the utensils appear free from digital artifacts or degradation. The visual representation aligns with typical wooden kitchen tools, confirming a natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the patterned tiles in the background visually plausible and consistent with the vintage theme, without any noticeable distortion or unnatural gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays patterned tiles behind the stove area that match a vintage kitchen aesthetic. The tiles are uniformly colored and aligned, lacking gradient inconsistencies or distortions. The arrangement and smooth transitions between tiles are coherent with typical design norms for vintage tiles. Thus, the tiles are visually plausible and consistent with the theme.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the soft floor shadows beneath the card appear natural and enhance the grounded presentation, without causing any visual inconsistencies or disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soft shadows cast beneath the card contribute to the spatial perception of depth and grounding. The shadow transitions are smooth and consistent with how light would interact with physical objects on a surface. These shadows do not disrupt the visual integrity of the setting or create inconsistencies, enhancing the card's grounded presentation.",
