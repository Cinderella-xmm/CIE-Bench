    "Question": "Q1: Are the proportions of both characters consistent and free from distortion in their respective views within the combined illustration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are shown from multiple perspectives, including side and overhead views. The proportions of the characters in each view appear consistent with their heights, body shapes, and relative positions to the office furniture. The overall proportion of limbs to the body and the angular representation of their seating posture is naturally depicted without signs of elongation or compression that would indicate distortion. By analyzing common human proportion standards, the characters reflect correct scale and measurement, which suggests that no distortion is present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the textures of the office elements such as chairs, plants, and desks appear natural and retain fine details without obvious artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In examining Image B, the chairs, plants, and desk appear with stylized but clear representations. The chairs have a simple design with smooth lines and uniform coloration typical of modern office furniture, without visible pixelation or noise. The plants are depicted with detailed leaves and clear edges, and the pots are well-shaped, fitting common office plant aesthetics. The desk has a flat, uniform surface typical of clean office space. These elements do not display visible digital artifacts like blurring or pixelation, indicative of preserved texture quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the computer screens realistic with sharp images, and does the interaction between the characters and screens appear natural without visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The computer screens in Image B display characters that are distinct and sharp in their graphic quality. The content on the screens mirrors the meeting scenario being depicted from different angles. There is no apparent pixelation or distortion in the display area, maintaining their realism as electronic devices. The interaction between the characters and the screens shows natural engagement, with their hand positions suggesting active use of the computers. The screens allow a logical representation of virtual communication without presenting visual anomalies.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the characters align correctly with their environment, maintaining a plausible spatial relationship and avoiding any broken geometric shapes or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are positioned with clear alignment relative to their chairs and desks. The table, chairs, and characters form a coherent spatial arrangement, reinforcing a practical office environment. There is no evidence of geometric discontinuity; for instance, the characters' legs align properly under the desk, and the desktops support the computers logically. Such alignment points to a seamlessly integrated design typical of a well-structured digital illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the lighting, including the hanging lampâ€™s shadow and the light on the characters, maintain consistency and contribute to the natural appearance of the scene without unnatural contrasts?",
    "explanation": "Image B features overhead lighting coming from the lamp, casting light evenly across the scene. The lighting on the characters is consistent with the apparent direction and strength from the lamp, avoiding harsh shadows or abrupt light-dark transitions. The warm color palette from a yellowish light source harmonizes with the surrounding neutral tones, contributing to a unified ambiance. The absence of harsh highlights or illogically cast shadows supports the naturalness of the lighting effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"
