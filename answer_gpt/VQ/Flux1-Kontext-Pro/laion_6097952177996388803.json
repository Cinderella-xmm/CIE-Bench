      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the presence of a large, fantastical creature dramatically alters the landscape's appearance. The creature has taken over the foreground and is difficult to directly compare the peaks' heights or angularity against the original landscape from Image A due to this substantial modification. Hence, the primary focus in Image B shifts away from the peaks themselves. The background mountainous landscape seems to have similar structures to real mountains as expected, implying that the peaks essentially conform to this realistic depiction. Yet, given the transformation by having such a creature in the environment, assessing unchanged aspects directly could be challenging. Ultimately, the focal point is not on peaks, but the large creature alongside the major compositional alteration makes peaks also appear different in height and scale within context.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation involves a creature replacing natural mountain parts. The creature's hide has a textured and organic appearance, resembling fur or hide rather than smooth natural rock formations. It exhibits a distinct surface different from typical mountain slopes, lacking the usual rock textures and erosion lines that natural formations possess. The new texture seems consistent with a heavy, furry hide and not like the smooth surfaces of rocks, not indicative of tile-like patterns or sharp edges typically associated with digital manipulation artifacts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the image features a creature in the landscape, with its body seemingly covered in moss, which appears to integrate with the surroundings, resting naturally on the terrain. The root-like strands lie along the ground in a way that appears consistent with natural growth patterns, extending outward and following the contours of the slopes. They do not appear to be floating or forming clusters that defy gravity, aligning instead with natural gravitational and vegetative patterns, maintaining a coherent appearance within the landscape context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the musculature refers to the creature's form rather than a natural landform. The creature's body has a pronounced, powerful physical structure, with defined contours that relate more to animal anatomy than the smooth, flowing curves typical of a valley. There's an organic transition of the creature merging into the landscape, but this is a departure from natural land depressions. Protrusions align with a creature's anatomy rather than exaggerated or disjointed landscape structures, following the body's design rather than landscape rules.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's transformed elements, the creature featuring fur and hide, maintain core habitat tones, such as earthy browns and greens, mirroring natural landscapes. These colors don't display abrupt changes in hue or brightness and mingle well with the existing terrain. The tonal consistency ensures a seamless transition between the creature and the setting, maintaining the visual unity within the altered landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, due to the significant transformation by the presence of the creature, there is a reduced focus on small-scale details like erosion lines or rock crevices in areas now occupied by the creature. However, around the creatures and elsewhere in the landscape, subtle details like the terrainâ€™s natural textures and formations are maintained. The setting beyond the creature retains recognizable natural elements and textures, preserving clarity, without apparent blurring or duplication issues that could arise from digital alterations.",
