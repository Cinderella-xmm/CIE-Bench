      "question": "Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scene depicted inside the snow globe retains the key elements from Image A, including the shoreline, the sunlight reflecting off the water, and the positioning of the surfer figure with the surfboard. The continuity of these elements suggests an effort to recreate the original beach setting within the confines of a snow globe. The figure and surfboard are visibly consistent with how they are represented outside the globe in Image A. Thus, it appears structurally consistent and visually credible.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the hands of the chibi-style 3D surfer figure free of unnatural textures and maintain the correct number of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the surfer figure is depicted in a chibi style, a closer look shows hands with textures that appear smooth and natural, aligning with the visual style. The hands seem to have the correct number of fingers, similar to standard human anatomy, even within the constraints of the chibi art style.",

      "question": "Does the soft golden light and sparkles scattered around the snow globe create a natural and plausible warm atmosphere without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates a snow globe that captures the soft, golden lighting reminiscent of a sunset, consistent with the beach scene's lighting in Image A. The addition of sparkles and the warm hues contribute to a realistic and inviting atmosphere. There are no glaring artifacts that detract from the visual coherence or aesthetic of the scene.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the miniature surfer figure and surfboard remain intact and undistorted within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the geometric contours of the surfer figure and surfboard appear to maintain their integrity and are clear within the confines of the snow globe. The representation stays faithful to the original elements seen in Image A, without evident warping or distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the placement of the snow globe on the wooden shelf near the fireplace visually credible and proportionally realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B is placed on a wooden shelf in what seems like a domestic setting, with a fireplace nearby. The proportions and scale of the snow globe relative to the shelf and surrounding elements, like the visible parts of the fireplace, appear reasonable and typical for such decorative objects. This placement suggests a realistic and believable scene arrangement.",
