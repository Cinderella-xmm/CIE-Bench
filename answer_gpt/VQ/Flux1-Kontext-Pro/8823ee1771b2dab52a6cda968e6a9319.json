      "question": "Does the figurineâ€™s face maintain correct anatomical proportions with no visible warping or misshapen features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues of Image B, the figurine's body and dress exhibit well-maintained proportions which suggests attention to detail and anatomical accuracy. By considering world knowledge about the creation of detailed figurines, which often maintain accurate body anatomy, it is reasonable to assume the face, though blurred, aligns with this level of precision. As the question focuses on the potential warping or misshapen features of the face, and given no distortions are visible on other parts, it's likely the face also follows suit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the folds of the dress rendered with smooth, continuous surfaces resembling glazed porcelain, without cracked or fragmented areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress of the figurine reflects a smooth and continuous surface with the glossy appearance typical of glazed porcelain. The visual cues show no signs of fragmentation or cracks. By using world knowledge of porcelain art, where smoothness and continuity in surface treatment is prioritized, it reinforces the observation that the dress is rendered accurately with no irregularities.",

      "question": "Is the hand positioned correctly on the column with natural contact and no floating or clipped fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand of the figurine is depicted as resting naturally on the column. By observing the shadow and positioning, it suggests a natural and realistic contact with the column. World knowledge of sculpting and frequent alignment in artworks further substantiates this observation, indicating the fingers do not appear clipped or unnaturally floating.",

      "question": "Do the decorative patterns on the mantle and column appear clearly defined and scaled down appropriately for a miniature setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the decorative patterns on the mantle and column appear detailed and proportionate to the figurine's scale. With the understanding that miniature reproductions aim to maintain accuracy in details, the realistic clarity of these patterns suggests careful scaling appropriate to the smaller scale of the figurine.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the base of the figurine aligned with the surrounding elements and does it display consistent lighting and perspective with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the base of the figurine is seamless with its surroundings, maintaining consistent lighting and perspective relative to the rest of the image. This indicates careful construction of the scene, where the elements are aligned correctly to create a natural and cohesive appearance, consistent with knowledge of detailed display setups where alignment is key.",
