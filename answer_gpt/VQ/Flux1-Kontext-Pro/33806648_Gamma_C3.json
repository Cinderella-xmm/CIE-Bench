      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the skeletal wing-like extensions emerge naturally from the rock arch's edges without gaps, floating sections, or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) features a rocky arch structure adorned with crystalline spikes rather than skeletal wing-like extensions which are not present. The crystalline spikes appear naturally integrated with the arch, emerging directly from the rock at natural angles, with no gaps or floating sections visible. The spikes seem to be a part of the arch itself. This analysis relies on the visual continuity and seamless integration with the rocky material in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the crystalline growths along the archâ€™s curve textured and colored to blend with the surrounding rock, avoiding excessive gloss or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystalline growths on the arch in the edited image (Image B) have a distinct blue tint that contrasts with the brownish hue of the rock. While they do not perfectly blend in terms of color, they are textured to appear part of the rock formation. Despite having a noticeable shimmer, this doesn't come off as excessively glossy or unnatural given the mystical theme. The highlights appear consistent with their crystalline nature.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the glowing veins across the surface follow natural mineral-like patterns and have soft, continuous light emission without jagged edges or blocky artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing veins in the edited image (Image B) appear to follow organic, vein-like patterns seen in certain naturally occurring mineral deposits. The light emission is continuous and smooth, enhancing the magical aesthetic within the context of the image. The veins lack jagged edges or blocky artifacts, indicating a thoughtful integration into the arch's design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the runic symbols on the inner surface of the arch carved into the rock with consistent depth and shadow, matching the texture of natural erosion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the runic symbols carved into the arch have a consistent depth across the surface. The shadows cast by the symbols add to the illusion of depth, aligning with the eroded and ancient texture of the rock. This consistency lends them the appearance of naturally eroded features rather than superficial additions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the radiant orb emit light that matches the ambient lighting direction and creates realistic soft shadows and reflections on adjacent rock surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The radiant orb in Image B emits a warm glow that corresponds with the overall light mood of the scenery, suggesting coherent ambient lighting. This emission is consistent with the casting of soft shadows on the surrounding surfaces and the reflections seen on the rocks, enhancing the realism of the entire composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the ground textures, cracks, and soil near the base of the arch preserved and not obscured or distorted by the added elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows an intricate ground texture that includes visible soil, cracks, and small rocky features near the base of the arch. These elements are preserved and not obscured by the crystal additions or the structure of the arch itself. The details remain intact and natural-looking, indicating that the integration of new features did not distort the existing ground elements.",
