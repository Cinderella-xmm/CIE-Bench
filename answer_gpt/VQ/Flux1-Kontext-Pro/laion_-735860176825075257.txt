    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing sharply defined and angular without rounded or blurred transitions that contradict the paper-cut style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the rooflines, gables, and timber framing are observed. The lines are expected to have sharp angles and transitions consistent with a paper-cut style. This style typically embodies clean, sharply defined edges that do not exhibit any blurring or roundness. By evaluating the visual cues, these elements appear to adhere to the angular and paper-cut style, confirming the stylistic integrity.",
