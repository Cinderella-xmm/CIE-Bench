    "Question": "Q1: Do the sausages held by the chibi figures maintain their natural texture and color, without any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the colored box depicts chibi figures holding sausages which appear smooth with a texture typical of plastic materials.
