      "question": "Does the child's coat maintain a coherent shape with natural folds and no distorted or broken seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child's coat has a consistently structured appearance with well-defined pockets and buttons that create a natural and realistic shape. The visual depiction does not show any distorted or broken seams, and the folds appear natural and expected for a child's coat made from such material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the balloon surfaces evenly colored in pastel tones without visible color bleeding or loss of specular highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The balloons in Image B display a range of pastel tones that are applied consistently across their surfaces. There is no visible color bleeding or merging between different colored balloons, and the highlights are subtly retained, which helps in maintaining their realistic appearance despite the watercolor effect.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the child’s right hand holding the balloons have exactly five fingers with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s right hand is depicted holding the balloons with a natural pose. Upon closer inspection, the hand maintains the correct anatomical structure and includes five fingers, all proportionately shaped and correctly aligned as per natural human anatomy.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the watercolor texture applied uniformly across the wheat field without disrupting the visibility of individual stalks or creating unnatural stroke lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheat field in Image B is rendered with a watercolor effect that is consistently applied, allowing individual stalks to remain visible and distinct. The texture does not disrupt the natural appearance of the field, nor does it introduce any unnatural stroke lines that could detract from the imagery.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the calendar grid positioned at ground level and aligned with the path beneath the child, without floating or casting unrealistic shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the calendar grid is situated at a higher position relative to the child, not at ground level. It appears attached to the left side, near the balloons, giving an impression of floating above the wheat field. This makes it look out of place if expected to be at ground level.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the clouds in the sky maintain natural edges and volume without visible pixelation or unnatural smoothing effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in Image B are consistent with a watercolor style but maintain natural edges and volume. There is no pixelation or apparent smoothing that disrupts their realistic appearance within the context of this art style.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
