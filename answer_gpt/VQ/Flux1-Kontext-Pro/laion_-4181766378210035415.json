    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks forming the bed frame, mattress, and base properly aligned and interlocked without visible gaps or misalignments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bed frame, mattress, and base are constructed from LEGO bricks. Observing the alignment and interlocking of these bricks, we can see that there are gaps or misalignments, suggesting that the bricks are not properly interlocked. This is inferred from the visible seams and uneven alignment typical of misaligned LEGO constructions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the light blue floral pattern on the duvet appear consistent with the original design, with no missing or incorrectly placed colored bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The duvet in Image B has a light blue floral pattern recreated using LEGO bricks. The pattern's consistency is assessed by comparing to typical LEGO construction and pattern replication, looking for missing bricks or irregularities. The pattern appears disrupted due to the nature of brick assembly, indicating inconsistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the curved shape of the new headboard composed of LEGO-style elements that follow realistic LEGO curvature without appearing stretched or deformed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headboard in Image B is composed of LEGO elements. Realistic LEGO curvature typically involves smooth, uniform curves without distortion. In this image, the headboard appears to follow natural LEGO curves without stretch or deformation, consistent with realistic LEGO construction methods.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the pillows formed by stacked LEGO bricks showing a natural three-dimensional shape with appropriate layering and no floating or disconnected pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pillows are constructed using stacked LEGO bricks. A natural three-dimensional shape would involve proper layering without disconnection between bricks. Upon examination, the bricks show appropriate alignment, ensuring a coherent and stable structure without floating pieces.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the LEGO bed match the lighting direction and softness of the original image, with no unnatural dark spots or over-bright areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Shadows in Image B must align with the lighting direction and characteristics visible in Image A. The shadows here are consistent with the original image, showing appropriate direction and softness, matching the ambient lighting without noticeable discrepancies.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the proportions and positions of the pillows, duvet, and headboard consistent with the original bed, with no noticeable scaling errors or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To determine consistency, we compare the proportions and positions of the elements in both images. The LEGO version in Image B has similar proportions and placement of the pillows, duvet, and headboard as seen in Image A, with no apparent scaling distortions or dislocations.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Do all LEGO bricks have a uniform matte finish with no unnatural glossiness, transparency, or pixelation that would suggest low-quality rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The finish of LEGO bricks in Image B should reflect typical matte textures without glossiness or transparency. The bricks demonstrate a consistent matte appearance, free from any unnatural effects that could denote poor rendering quality, indicating good rendering process.",
