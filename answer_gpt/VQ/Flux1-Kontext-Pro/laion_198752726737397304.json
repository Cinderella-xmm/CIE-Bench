      "question": "Do the superhero costumes on all five individuals have consistent fabric textures and realistic draping that follow the contours of their bodies without unnatural stretching or folding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features individuals dressed in superhero costumes, likely intended to mimic the aesthetic commonly seen in comic books or superhero films. These costumes are typically form-fitting and designed to follow the contours of the human body. In this image, although the costumes attempt to replicate such form-fitting designs, there may be visual cues indicating inconsistencies in fabric textures and unrealistic draping, possibly due to digital manipulation or costume fit issues. If the costumes don't follow the body contours realistically and display stretching or folding, the answer should be 'No'.",

      "question": "Are the hands holding the Daffodil Power Passes positioned naturally with five fingers visible per hand, appropriate grip pressure, and no signs of clipping or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several individuals are holding the Daffodil Power Passes. Natural hand positioning would include visible fingers and the correct grip pressure typically seen when a person is holding an object like a pamphlet. Upon examining the image, if there are artifacts such as clipping where parts of the fingers or pamphlet appear unnatural or detached, then the answer should be 'No'. This evaluation considers the visual continuity and realism of hand placement and object interaction.",

      "question": "Are the poses of the five individuals physically plausible, with joints aligned naturally and no bent limbs or disproportionate body segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Poses that are physically plausible typically involve naturally aligned joints and proportionate body segments that do not display unnatural bends or deformations. In Image B, despite the superhero costumes, if individuals' poses maintain natural body alignments and proportions similar to everyday stances or purposeful superhero poses without distortion, then the answer is 'Yes'. We must assess whether any digital alteration has led to unrealistic body positioning.",

      "question": "Are the dialogue bubbles positioned above or near the heads of the individuals without overlapping eyes or mouths, and do they display legible text with clean edges and no visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Dialogue bubbles in comic-style presentations are typically placed above or near individuals' heads to avoid covering facial features and maintain readability. In Image B, these bubbles should have clean edges, containing legible text without visual artifacts that could detract from the message clarity. If the bubbles are correctly positioned and legible, the answer should be 'Yes'. This involves examining the placement and ensuring they do not interfere with facial visibility and are devoid of artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the enhanced garden background visually coherent with the original scene, featuring consistent lighting, natural flower arrangements, and no abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garden background in Image B should maintain coherence with typical outdoor scenes featuring natural lighting and organic flower arrangements. Consistent lighting involves a uniform light source without abrupt color shifts. The textures should appear natural, avoiding artificial-looking enhancements as seen in manipulated images. If the scene seems consistent with natural aesthetics and there are no undue alterations, the answer should be 'Yes'. This evaluation checks for photographic consistency with realistic outdoor settings.",
