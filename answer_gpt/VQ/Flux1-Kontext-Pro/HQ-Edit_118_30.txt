    "Question": "Q1: Are the trainâ€™s locomotive and carriages transformed into interlocking geometric blocks that maintain their original proportions and alignment along the track without visible distortions or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train and its carriages are depicted as part of a puzzle. The puzzle pieces can be seen clearly, interlocking neatly. The image demonstrates that these pieces maintain alignment along the track, reflecting precise proportional consistency typical of puzzle representations. The train's proportions and alignments are preserved, and the image shows no significant distortions or misaligned edges around the train.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the smoke above the train rendered as smooth, continuous swirling white forms that follow the natural trajectory of rising steam without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke above the train has been turned into part of a puzzle, introducing cracks where the pieces meet. This alters the previously smooth and continuous appearance seen in Image A. While the natural trajectory is evident, the presence of the puzzle cracks constitutes jagged texture artifacts, disrupting an otherwise smooth form.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are all human figures at the station platform replaced by small, flat puzzle-shaped elements wearing vintage clothing, with no visible distortions in limbs or posture, and do they retain recognizable positions relative to benches and luggage?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are depicted as part of the puzzle scene. They appear as if they are inlaid within the puzzle without any distortion in limbs or posture despite the constraining outlines of puzzle pieces. Their positions relative to benches and luggage remain recognizable, sustaining the relative spatial narrative.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the fields and hills in the background rendered as clearly defined geometric patterns (e.g., rectangles, triangles) that form a cohesive, interlocking design without gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows fields and hills transformed into a puzzle format. These fields and hills remain as part of the puzzle assembly, lacking clearly defined geometric patterns like rectangles or triangles. The puzzle format does introduce some fragmentation, yet retains a cohesive design without identified gaps, overlapping errors, or abrupt texture changes.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the entire scene, including the train, tracks, station, and landscape, placed on a light wooden tabletop with visible wood grain and consistent lighting, and are there no floating elements or mismatched shadows?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is presented as a completed puzzle placed on a wooden tabletop. The wood grain is clearly visible, consistent with the lighting that suggests it is on the table's surface. The image lacks floating elements or mismatched shadows, indicating a cohesively integrated scene within the wooden tabletop context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
