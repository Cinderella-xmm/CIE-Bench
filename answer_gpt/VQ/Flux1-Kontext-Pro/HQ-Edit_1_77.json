      "question": "Are the facial features and body proportions of the central figure preserved and undistorted despite the artistic transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure's body appears in proportion, with no evident distortion to the neck, shoulders, or arms. The artistic style seems to have altered the image without skewing the proportionality of the figure. The hands, clothing, and jewelry maintain their relative positions and orientations according to the human anatomy, making the transformation seamless.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the added Maasai motifs on the blue garment appear to follow the natural folds and flow of the fabric. The patterns maintain a consistent line width and are free from irregular edges which could suggest poor integration. This indicates a careful adherence to the fabric's structure during the artistic transformation.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bead ornaments in the edited image do not seem to have glowing elements, nor is there evidence of light emission or uncontrolled lighting effects around the beads. Therefore, there are no halos or color bleeding onto the skin or the fabric, suggesting a controlled application of color to the bead ornaments.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
