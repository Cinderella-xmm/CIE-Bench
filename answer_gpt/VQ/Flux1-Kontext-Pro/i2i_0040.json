    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the textures on the bike frame and surrounding grass natural, without any visible artifacts or unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the texture on the bike frame appears smooth and glossy, which is consistent with a well-maintained bike. The grass appears uniformly green, and no unusual color variations or artifacts are noticeable. The colors are vivid yet realistic, which indicates that the textures and colors appear natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels and frame of the bike maintain their correct proportions and geometry, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bike's wheels appear circular, and the frame shows correct proportions typical of a road bike. The components of the bike, such as the handlebars, wheels, frame, and pedals, all seem to be proportionally accurate without signs of distortion or deformation, suggesting the bike maintains its intended geometric design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background clean and free from distracting elements, preserving the natural scene and focusing on the bike without introducing unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is a blurred green area with scattered white spots that mimic a natural grassy environment. This background keeps the focus on the bike by being simple and devoid of clutter or distracting details, successfully preserving a natural setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the bike and the surrounding area look natural and consistent with the original environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B casts natural shadows inline with the sunlit outdoor setting, creating a realistic effect. The light reflections on the bike frame and the shadow on the ground appear consistent with an outdoor scene. This suggests that the lighting and shadows have been carefully rendered to fit naturally with the bike's surroundings.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bike positioned naturally within the frame, maintaining visual coherence and plausibility without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the bike placed centrally and slightly to the right, positioned upright on the grass. It appears stable and properly aligned with the perceived ground plane, suggesting that the bike's placement is natural and coherent within the frame, making it look plausible and not out of place.",
