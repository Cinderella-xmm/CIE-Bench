    "explanation": "In Image B, the feather earrings have been anthropomorphized with eyes and a mouth added. The facial features are clearly visible and placed on the black oval area.

    "Question": "Q2: Is the central black oval stone on each feather preserved and unobscured by the added facial features, and do the engraved lines of the feather remain symmetrical and undistorted?",

The integration of facial features on this area retains its visibility and does not obstruct or distort the black stone shape itself. The engraved feather lines remain mostly symmetrical and undisturbed, indicating that the addition did not negatively impact the overall symmetry and design integrity.",

These appendages do not alter the attachment of the earrings to the hooks; they remain connected properly without any floating or unsuspended appearance.
