    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is presented without the distinct blocky or studded texture characteristic of LEGO bricks. The surfaces are smooth and lack the typical grid like pattern associated with LEGO construction. This indicates that the truck is designed as a scale model rather than a LEGO creation. Therefore, the orange, black, and silver sections are not composed of LEGO bricks.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are well-defined and smooth, but they do not exhibit any features specific to LEGO design, such as studs or brick-like textures. Instead, they appear as if designed for a realistic scale model, indicating that they are not composed of LEGO bricks or patterns.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck bed is smooth and uniform, not displaying any LEGO tile patterns like a grid layout that LEGO creations typically have. It matches more with a realistic scale model rather than a LEGO assembly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the truck positioned on a flat white surface which appears to be a shelf. There are no visual indicators of gaps or floating effects. The truck is placed evenly on the shelf, suggesting proper positioning without any evident support issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the major structural components of the truck, including the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers, are presented in correct proportions and alignment relative to the truck body. However, these elements are not reconstructed using LEGO bricks, as they do not exhibit brick textures or assembly patterns typical of LEGO construction.",
