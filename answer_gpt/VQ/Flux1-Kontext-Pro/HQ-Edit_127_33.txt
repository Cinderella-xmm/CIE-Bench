    "Question": "Q4: Are the butterfly-like creatures positioned at varying depths in the scene, with appropriate size scaling and soft edges that match the ambient lighting?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the butterflies are depicted at varying depths, contributing to the scene's sense of space and perspective. Their size changes according to distance from the viewer, and their colors and edges are softly merged with the lighting conditions of the scene, giving them a natural appearance within the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
