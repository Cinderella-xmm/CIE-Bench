      "question": "Does the character's transformation into an anime-style action figure maintain natural textures and fine details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a man on top of a large airplane. However, based on the question's description, it seems to be referring to a character transformation into an anime-style action figure. For an anime-style action figure to maintain natural textures and fine details, the figure should have smooth transitions between features such as clothing, hair, and other elements typical in anime figures. Any artifacts would be noticeable disruptions, such as pixelation or rough edges. In this scenario, without visual aids or artifacts in Image B that confirm any action figure transformation, there seems to be a misunderstanding. Thus, Image B doesn’t involve any transformation into an anime-style action figure based on visible cues.",

      "question": "Does the box design seamlessly integrate with the rest of the image, maintaining visual credibility without disrupting the overall scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a man standing atop the fuselage of an airplane on the runway. There is no box design visible in Image B. For a box design to seamlessly integrate into an image, it would need to blend naturally with shadows, proportions, and align accurately with other elements in the scene to maintain visual consistency. Since Image B does not feature any box design at all, it cannot be evaluated for seamless integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the airplane-related elements incorporated into the box design proportionally correct and physically rational, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a man is standing on an airplane without any visible box design or incorporation of airplane-related elements into a box. For airplane elements to be part of a box design proportionally and physically rationally, their sizes, shapes, and alignment within the box would need to match realistic expectations based on common proportions. Image B cannot be evaluated for such aspects as the context of a box design is missing.",

      "question": "Does the character's dynamic pose atop the small airplane wing appear structurally consistent and visually credible, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is standing atop the airplane fuselage, not a wing. For the pose to appear structurally consistent and visually credible, the person’s alignment with the plane should reflect realistic gravitation and stability, without any disproportions in body parts. The pose in Image B is consistent as the man is aligned correctly atop the fuselage, without visible unnatural deformations. However, note it refers to the plane fuselage, not a small wing.",

      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the hyper-realistic figure beside the box rendered realistically and naturally, resembling a professionally photographed product?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not display a hyper-realistic figure beside a box. It features a man standing on an airplane. For textures and materials to be hyper-realistic and resemble a photographed product, they should exhibit correct lighting, shadowing, material properties, and environmental reflections. In the absence of a hyper-realistic figure and box, Image B doesn’t exhibit such characteristics related to this query.",
