      "question": "Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the person working in the tea field appear larger but maintain anatomical accuracy, featuring five fingers with natural positions for joints. There are no visible distortions or unrealistic shapes. This is verified by observing the structure and alignment of the fingers and joints in the image, which appear to be natural and typical of a human hand.",

      "question": "Are the green tones in the tea field vibrant yet consistent with natural plant colors, showing smooth gradients without abrupt shifts or artificial-looking patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tea field exhibits a range of vibrant green tones that resemble natural plant colors. The greens transition smoothly across the leaves without sudden changes in hue, which suggests a realistic portrayal of a tea field. This observation is made by examining the continuity and harmony of the greens, which do not display any artificial-looking patches or abrupt shifts.",

      "question": "Does the gold foil effect on the sack’s logo appear as a smooth, reflective metallic layer without jagged edges, unnatural glare, or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B portrays the logo on the sack with a gold foil effect. Upon closer inspection, the logo maintains a smooth and reflective metallic appearance, with no noticeable jagged edges or unnatural glare. The lighting effect on the gold does not show inconsistencies which one would expect if it were improperly applied.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are vine-patterned borders along the edges, which mimic natural leaf and stem structures. These vine patterns do not intrude into the main scene, allowing the central image content to remain clear and unobstructed. The vines are designed to stay at the borders and they align with the natural design without overlapping into the primary depiction.",

      "question": "Is the recycled paper texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or tea leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The recycled paper texture in Image B appears uniformly across the entire image surface. This texture does not obstruct fine details—such as the strands of the worker’s hair, the intricate folds in the clothing, or the delineations of the tea leaves—indicating an even application that compliments rather than hindering the detailed aspects of the drawing.",
