      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of the 3D chibi-style bicycles consistent with their original forms, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B independently, the shapes and proportions of the bicycles appear consistent with what one would expect from normal bicycles. The elements such as frames, wheels, and handlebars look well-formed and realistic without signs of distortion. Comparing with Image A, both images maintain similar proportions and structure across bicycles, indicating no unnatural distortions in the edited image.",

      "question": "Do the colors of the 3D chibi-style bicycles match their original counterparts without introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bicycles display colors that are vibrant and similar to those typically found on bicyclesâ€”red, blue, and black. There are no signs of textures that would seem unrealistic or unnatural for metal. In comparing with Image A, the colors remain consistent, supporting that the edited image has maintained the original color scheme and texture without introducing unnatural elements.",

      "question": "Are the 3D chibi-style bicycles arranged in the same relative positions and spacing as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the bicycles are positioned such that they face forward and are evenly spaced, indicating a well-considered arrangement in line with standard display setups. When comparing to Image A, both images show bicycles in the same positions and relative spacing, suggesting consistency in arrangement.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the 3D chibi-style bicycles align naturally with the light source and the floor, contributing to the overall authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shadows appear directly beneath the bicycles, matching the direction and intensity typical for shadows created by a light source from the window above. When comparing with Image A, both images exhibit similarly oriented shadows indicating an accurate light source representation. The shadows fall naturally, enhancing the realism of the overall scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the wheels, frames, and other components of the 3D chibi-style bicycles retained their fine details without introducing any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B appears to maintain clear details in the bicycles, such as wheel spokes, frame shape, and chain structure, without visible artifacts that detract from realism. Comparing this with Image A, the level of detail is consistent across both images, and no obvious artifacts are present in the edited image.",
