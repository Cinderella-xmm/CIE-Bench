    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the waterfall in the center of the image appear as a coherent, transparent projection with smooth flow lines and consistent light interaction, without visible pixelation or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "When observing the waterfall in Image B, visual cues show a consistent flow and interaction with light, likely simulated to create an immersive and coherent projection effect. The waterfall's smooth lines and realistic transparency imply sophisticated rendering with no visible pixelation or broken shapes. It seems intentionally designed to appear as a seamless projection, reflecting coherent linear elements that mimic natural water movement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree trunks and vines in the foreground displaying iridescent fiber-optic-like strands that follow natural branch contours without breaking geometric continuity or exhibiting patchy, non-uniform glow patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks and vines exhibit luminescent strands reminiscent of fiber-optic lights. These strands align with the natural curvature of the branches, maintaining geometric continuity without breaks. The glow is uniform and evenly distributed, enhancing the visual realism of the scene and avoiding any patchiness, suggesting a thoughtful design emphasizing smoothness in iridescence application.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the vine formations in the foreground and along the riverbanks form continuous, self-supporting loops without floating disconnected segments or geometrically impossible bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine formations in Image B create visually plausible loops that appear self-supporting, following natural growth patterns seen in organic structures. They do not exhibit physically impossible configurations or unattached segments, implying deliberate attention to ensuring structural realism and plausibility within the scene framework, reinforcing a coherent and believable nature-inspired design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background landscape (distant mountains and sky) visually consistent with the foreground projections, showing no abrupt transitions, mismatched lighting, or unnatural fog effects that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B integrates smoothly with foreground elements, maintaining consistent lighting and visual style. The transition between distant mountains and the sky with the foreground is subtle and well-blended, showing no abrupt switches in color or lighting intensity, nor presence of unnatural fog effects, which confirms a seamless rendering approach in creating a harmonious scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures of the river stones, foliage, and moss-covered surfaces in the lower portion of the image sharp and detailed, without blurred edges or repeating pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the lower portion of Image B, the textures of river stones, foliage, and moss are rendered with clarity and detail, characterized by distinct shapes and edges. There is no evidence of blurred textures or repeating patterns that could indicate poor texture mapping or rendering, demonstrating high-quality detailed craftsmanship in these natural elements to accentuate their realism.",
