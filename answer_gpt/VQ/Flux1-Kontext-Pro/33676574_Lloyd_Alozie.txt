    "Question": "Q1: Does the tallest tower on the left retain its original vertical structure and proportional height after being modified with robotic limb features, without any visible stretching, compression, or broken edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower shows modifications with added structure. These robotic limb features are smoothly integrated without disrupting the towerâ€™s vertical proportions or introducing visible distortions such as stretched or compressed elements. The edges remain clean, indicating a careful integration of the new features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers smoothly integrated into the facade without visible line breaks, uneven spacing, or unnatural color gradients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, neon circuitry patterns are visually inspected for integration quality. The patterns appear to be seamlessly applied to the building facades, lacking line breaks or any unnatural spacing between them. The color gradients used are consistent and appear natural within the night scene lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the scale-like panels on the dark glass towers exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior, with no repeating patterns or distorted shapes suggesting low-quality rendering?",
    "explanation": "Image B's towers, especially those with scale-like panels, show uniform texture and reflection indicating high-quality rendering. The panels exhibit smooth, consistent behavior in their reflections across the structures with no visible repetitions or distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the glowing expressway spines maintain realistic width and curvature throughout their length, connecting logically to surrounding roads and showing no floating or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "The glowing expressway spines in Image B are visually assessed for realistic depiction. These elements maintain a consistent width and curvature along their length, connecting properly to the overall road structure without any disjointed or floating sections.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately, without appearing detached or structurally unstable?",
    "explanation": "The fin-like structures added to the buildings in Image B are well-aligned with the existing rooflines. Their scaling appears appropriate for each building, contributing to an appearance that is structurally stable without any apparent detachment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the holographic eye-like elements located on top of major towers clearly defined with smooth light emission and no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images?",
    "explanation": "The eye-like holographic elements in Image B exhibit clear definition with a smooth light emission. Their design integrates well with the skyline, showing no signs of digital artifacts like aliasing or unintended duplications.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are all illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details (e.g., on the EMAAR building and VOCO tower) sharp and legible, with no visible blurring or degradation from the editing process?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, detailed inspection of illuminated windows, signs, and architectural features reveals clear sharpness and legibility. The editing maintains high quality without obvious blurring or degradation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
