    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features on the frame near the handlebars seamlessly integrated with the red surface, showing no visible seams, texture mismatch, or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on the visual cues in Image B, no distinct facial features are present near the handlebars. The surface shows smooth continuity of the red painted area without any texture mismatch or color artifacts which can indicate facial features. Common sense tells us that the handlebars typically do not display facial features, adding to the conclusion that the surface is cohesive and seamless.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cartoon limbs extend from the hub centers without distorting the wheel rims, spokes, or hub components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual representation is a stylized comic illustration of a motorcycle, where cartoon elements like limbs typically branch from the hub centers due to artistic design choices. However, in this image, no specific depiction of limbs distorting the rims, spokes, or hub can be seen. The wheels retain their integrity in a comic style without distortion, maintaining circular form, aligned spokes, and centralized hub design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the sides of the bike and angled forward, without crossing over the chain, derailleur, or “DUCATI” logo?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a motorcycle in a dynamic, comic-style illustration, complete with motion lines to suggest speed. These lines are positioned along the motorcycle's outer edges and angled forward, enhancing motion effect. Analysis indicates none of these lines intersect the action train components, like the chain and derailleur, nor do they obscure the 'DUCATI' logo or any significant mechanical parts.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the frame retain its original tubular structure and dimensional consistency despite the added hero suit design, with no bulges, collapses, or incorrect curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the frame must maintain its defined structure despite any added stylistic elements, such as the hero suit design. The tubular frame appears consistent with comic design norms, showing no signs of structural deviation such as bulges, collapses, or curvature errors which would disrupt the visual consistency expected in comic illustrations.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sound effect texts positioned outside the main structural components of the bike and oriented in a way that suggests movement, without obscuring the “DUCATI” branding or control levers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sound effect text 'VROOM!' is strategically placed in the top left of the image, aligning with the comic's dynamic context. It remains outside the main structure of the bike, visually enhancing the sense of motion and action. This placement away from key components like the 'DUCATI' logo or operational controls ensures unimpeded visual access to the branding and function, supporting its artistic and communicative purpose without hindrance.",
