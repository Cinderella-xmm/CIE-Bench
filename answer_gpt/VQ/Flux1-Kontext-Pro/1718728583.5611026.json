    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the robot's body exhibit smooth, continuous chrome-like surfaces without visible texture breaks or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot presents a smooth, continuous chrome-like surface across its body. The material appears reflective and uniform, with no apparent texture breaks or material inconsistencies. The polished appearance is consistent with a modern robotic design, contributing to a cohesive and visually smooth look.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the flamingos rendered as cohesive geometric shapes with consistent edges and proportions, without fragmented or disconnected components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flamingos are depicted with cohesive geometric shapes, maintaining consistent edges and proportions typical of stylized rendering. Their shapes look complete and well-constructed, without fragmented or disconnected parts, indicating a well-executed visual representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and rocks in the background have angular, stylized forms that maintain consistent perspective and spatial relationships without appearing disjointed or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and rocks display angular, stylized forms. They maintain consistent perspective and spatial relationships with their surroundings, which suggests they are not disjointed or floating. The scene depicts a cohesive environment where background elements are part of a unified composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette across the entire scene consistently muted and pastel-toned, with no areas exhibiting sudden or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is consistently muted and pastel-toned across the scene. The colors of the flamingos, sky, and landscape elements all blend well without exhibiting any sudden or jarring deviations. This choice adds to the serene and harmonious atmosphere of the composition.",

      "question": "Do the robot's hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural curvature and spacing, and no extra or malformed digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's hands are depicted with exactly five fingers each. The fingers exhibit natural curvature and spacing, adhering closely to human anatomical standards without any extra or malformed digits. This representation shows attention to detail and anatomical accuracy.",
