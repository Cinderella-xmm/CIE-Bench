    "Question": "Q1: Do the transformed columns resemble organic wooden legs with natural joint angles and proportional thickness, without visible distortion or broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a structure supported by columns that mimic tree trunks with realistic organic appearances. They have natural joint angles and proportional thickness commonly found in real trees, without showing distortion or broken geometry. This design enhances the illusion of a natural, tree-integrated building.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Does the roof area show a gradual transition from straw-like material to leafy branches with realistic leaf shapes, spacing, and lighting interaction, without jagged edges or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the roof retains a straw-like appearance rather than transitioning to leafy branches. The material maintains its straw texture consistently, without jagged edges or unnatural textures often found in artificial images. This contributes to the structure's rustic aesthetic.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Is the satellite dish replaced by a large, detailed eye with a visible iris and pupil, positioned naturally on the side of the structure, without floating elements or mismatched shading?",
    "explanation": "Image B still contains a satellite dish rather than a large eye. It is positioned naturally, matching the shading and placement of the structure without any modifications suggesting an eye. This component keeps its technological form intact, contrasting with nature-themed elements.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the wall surfaces covered with detailed bark patterns showing natural cracks, ridges, and color gradients, without repeating textures or uniformity indicating artificial generation?",
    "explanation": "Image B displays wall surfaces featuring detailed bark patterns with visible natural cracks and color gradients, reflecting an organic, natural appearance. These wall textures are convincingly irregular and varied, avoiding repetitive patterns that suggest artificial generation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the orange blossoms emit a faint, diffused glow that blends with ambient lighting, without sharp halos or unnatural brightness that separates them from the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "The orange blossoms in Image B produce a faint glow that seamlessly integrates with the ambient lighting. They exhibit diffused light without forming sharp halos or unnatural separation from their environment, enhancing their ethereal appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the vines emerge from multiple points on the structure, hang downward with natural curvature and density variation, and interact realistically with light and shadows?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows vines originating from various points, hanging down with natural curvature and varied density as commonly seen in real settings. They interact believably with light and shadows, contributing to the lively, natural integration into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
