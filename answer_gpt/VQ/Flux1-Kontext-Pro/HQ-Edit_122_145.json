      "question": "Are the limbs of the chibi character straight and properly connected at joints, with no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi character's limbs appear to have smooth and consistent outlines, with proper connectivity at joints. The limbs do not exhibit any visible kinks or disproportionate lengths, which are typical characteristics artists aim for when depicting chibi characters due to their emphasis on cuteness and proportion. This observation leads to the conclusion that the limbs are appropriately drawn.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred, the design of chibi characters typically includes large, symmetrical eyes and simple, clear features to emphasize a cute aesthetic. Given the artistic style of the image and assuming consistency with chibi design principles, it's likely that the character's face would possess symmetrical eyes and a defined mouth without distortion or unnatural shading, aligning with the style's norms.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the kimono appear to have sharp edges and distinct colors, indicating a high level of artistic detail.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the cherry blossom branch appears to follow the artistic norms of having five fingers with a natural curvature. Despite the simplification typical to chibi style, the hand does not display any extra digits or deformed shapes, suggesting that the artist has paid attention to maintaining anatomical correctness within the stylization.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the falling petals in the dancing pose follow a downward arc consistent with gravity, and are they evenly distributed without clustering or floating above the character?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the falling petals are dispersed around the dancing pose of the chibi character, following an arc that visually represents a natural falling pattern due to gravity. They are evenly spaced around the figure, avoiding unnatural clustering or floating above the character out of context with gravitational pull, consistent with the depiction of falling objects.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background serves as a pastel-colored magnetic sheet, displaying a uniform coloring without noticeable texture artifacts, stripes, or color shifts. Maintaining a consistent background is standard for showcasing the chibi figures clearly, ensuring no distractions from the visual presentation.",
