    "Question": "Q1:Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the silhouette of the woman is crafted to resemble a seated figure reading a book. The chair, posture, and positioning were considered to ensure proportional integrity. The recognizable features — such as the presence of arms, legs, and the curvature of the seated posture — are correctly aligned and free from visible distortions, which is consistent with an understanding of proper human anatomy.",
