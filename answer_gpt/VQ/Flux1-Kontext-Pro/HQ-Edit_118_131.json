    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the added gears and copper accents seamlessly integrated into the silver surface of the teapot without visible texture inconsistencies or material discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot has a consistent surface with intricate patterns and the gears and copper accents appear to integrate harmoniously with the existing design without any apparent texture discrepancies or material discontinuities. The visual cohesion supports that the integration was executed seamlessly.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the curved glass dome appear transparent and smoothly contoured without geometric distortions or artificial edges that break the illusion of a real glass enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the glass dome is smoothly contoured and transparent, maintaining the illusion of a real glass enclosure. There are no visible distortions or edges that detract from its natural appearance, enhancing the realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wooden floorboards and scattered tea leaves rendered with realistic textures and proportions, and do the tiny silver utensils appear appropriately scaled and detailed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden floorboards show a realistic texture with appropriate grain and detail. The tea leaves scattered on the floor blend well within the scale, and the tiny silver utensils are detailed and proportional, suggesting a high level of rendering quality in their depiction.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the moss accents naturally distributed along the base edge, with soft, organic texture and no signs of unnatural clustering or color mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts moss along the base edge that appears to be softly textured and organically distributed. There are no signs of clustering that seem unnatural nor any color mismatches, which enhances the natural look of the environment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the steam effect emerging from the elephant's trunk appear as a smooth, translucent vapor with natural diffusion and no jagged edges or artificial glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam effect in Image B appears smooth and translucent, with natural diffusion characteristics. There are no jagged edges or artificial glow that would undermine the natural essence of the vapor, indicating a convincing representation.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the vine-like metalwork elements consistently shaped and positioned around the dome, following natural curvatures without intersecting the glass unnaturally or creating inconsistent shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vine-like metalwork in Image B is consistently shaped and arranged coherently around the dome. They follow the natural curvature and do not unnaturally intersect with the dome or create inconsistent shadows, indicating careful positioning and design alignment.",
