    "Question": "Q1: Are the character’s eyes in Panel 1 clearly narrowed and intense, with visible tension in the eyelids and pupils, and is the hand gripping the katana properly aligned with five distinct fingers showing natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, Panel 1, the character's eyes do appear narrow and intense, indicating a focus or determined expression. The eyelids are drawn to create tension, which is common in anime to convey intensity. However, the character does not have visible fingers gripping the katana in Panel 1. Instead, the focus is on the facial expression rather than the hand or fingers. Thus, if the hand alignment is part of the consideration, it is not portrayed in this panel.",
