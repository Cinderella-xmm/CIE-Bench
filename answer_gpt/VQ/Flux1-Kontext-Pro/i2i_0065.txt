    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass display case appear transparent and free of unnatural textures or distortions that would make it look artificial?",
    "explanation": "The glass display case in Image B is meant to encase the dog, similar to how exhibits are shown in museums. A natural glass display should be transparent and free from visual artifacts that suggest digital manipulation. Upon close examination, there appear to be no significant distortions or textures that would interfere with its realistic appearance. The edges, reflections, and refractions look consistent with a real glass case.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the light focused on the dogâ€™s face well-integrated with the environment, without introducing noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the scene?",
    "explanation": "The lighting on the dog's face in Image B should be consistent with typical museum lighting, which is generally soft and evenly distributed to highlight exhibits without creating harsh shadows. The lighting here appears even and does not introduce disruptive shadows or stark highlights that would indicate poor photo editing or inconsistency with the surrounding environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Does the dog remain proportionally consistent within the new museum exhibit setup, avoiding any distortion or deformation in its physical structure?",
    "explanation": "In an edited scene where an object is integrated into a new environment, maintaining proportionality is crucial to maintain realism. The dog in Image B, positioned as a museum exhibit, retains its natural dimensions and proportions. There is no visible distortion or deformation in its body structure that would suggest poor adaptation to the new setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the informational label about the breed and story appear naturally placed, with no jagged edges or abrupt transitions that suggest poor integration?",
    "explanation": "Information labels in museum exhibits typically have a clean, flat placement, with clear text that is integrated naturally into the scene. The label in Image B appears to be naturally placed, with smooth edges and no signs of poor editing such as jagged edges or abrupt transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the fine details of the dog, such as fur texture and facial expression, maintained with clarity and authenticity, without becoming overly smoothed or pixelated?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's fur texture and facial expression are critical for maintaining a realistic appearance. Despite the editing process for its placement in the museum scene, the details, including the fur texture and facial expression, are clear and retain a natural look, avoiding any over-smoothing or pixelation that could suggest a loss of authenticity in the editing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
