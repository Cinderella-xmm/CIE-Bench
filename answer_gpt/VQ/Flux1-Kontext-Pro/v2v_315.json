      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is designed in a 3D chibi style, which is characterized by exaggerated features such as a larger head and smaller body, typical of the chibi art style. These exaggerated features are deliberate and not considered distortions. The character maintains this style without any parts appearing unnaturally stretched or squeezed, maintaining the integrity of a chibi design known for its cuteness and distinctive proportion.",
