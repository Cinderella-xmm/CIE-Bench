      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the woman's face and body maintain natural proportions without exaggerated or distorted features such as uneven eyes, misplaced limbs, or unnatural curvature?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, analyzing the figure shows that the proportions of the body seem consistent with natural human anatomy. Both arms are positioned symmetrically, and the curvature in the fabric aligns with standard dress design. This suggests that the proportions are maintained without any exaggerated aspects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress enlarged proportionally without breaking their natural shape or causing jagged edges, and do the gold highlights blend seamlessly into the fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the dress in Image B appear smooth and well-defined, maintaining their natural shapes without noticeable distortion or jagged edges. The gold highlights integrate well into the texture of the fabric, adding to overall coherence and subtle enhancement without clashing.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the radiant hues applied to the dress appear smooth and evenly distributed without visible color bleeding, unnatural glow artifacts, or disrupted fabric texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on the dress appear uniformly applied with smooth transitions between shades. There is no visible color bleeding or glow artifacts; rather, the fabric texture remains consistent, enhancing the overall appearance without disruption.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the abstract bamboo shadows align with the existing light source and cast believable depth without appearing detached, inconsistent, or overlapping incorrectly with the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows in Image B are consistent with the light coming from the top of the image, as indicated by the brighter areas and shadows on the bamboo. The shadows are appropriately placed, enhancing the depth without causing inconsistencies or overlapping awkwardly with the figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bamboo-shaped writing panel positioned naturally within the scene, with smooth edges and watercolor motifs that match the surrounding textures and do not exhibit harsh lines or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bamboo-shaped panel in Image B is positioned in a way that complements the scene, with smooth edges and watercolor-like motifs. The textures match the surrounding bamboo elements, avoiding harsh lines or unnatural transitions, thereby integrating well within the scene.",
