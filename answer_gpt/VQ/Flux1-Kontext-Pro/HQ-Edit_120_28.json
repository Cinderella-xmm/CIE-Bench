      "question": "Is the treasure chest still geometrically intact and proportionally consistent with its original form when placed on the newly added weathered map background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a treasure chest set against a weathered map background. Visually, the chest retains its original geometric integrity and proportional consistency from Image A, showing no alterations in shape or size. Knowledge of typical graphical edits suggests that integrating objects into new backgrounds often preserves the original object's dimensions unless specific changes are intended.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ropes used as decorative borders maintain their natural fiber texture and realistic coil shapes without appearing stretched, flattened, or unnaturally contorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ropes depicted as decorative elements around the chest and on the map are visually examined for texture and shape fidelity. They exhibit realistic coil shapes that are consistent with how ropes naturally appear without signs of distortion or graphic errors such as stretching or flattening. This assessment is based on common rope characteristics and visual perception.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the symbols and ancient-style text in the legend aligned properly with the overall lighting and depth of the image, and do they appear cleanly rendered without jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image's legend contains symbols and ancient-style text which must align spatially with the lighting and depth inherent to the map. Observing Image B shows that the text and symbols are sharply rendered, without jagged edges or any visual artifacts like color bleeding, indicating a cohesive integration within the graphical environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the compass rose in the bottom-right corner have consistent metallic sheen and shadowing that aligns with the lighting direction and material properties of the surrounding gold coins and gems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B includes a compass rose in the lower right corner, with surrounding gold coins and gems providing a comparison baseline. The compass rose presents a metallic sheen and shadowing consistent with the lighting's direction and material traits seen in nearby objects. Understanding how light and shadow interact with metallic surfaces assists in confirming this alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sea monster motifs seamlessly blended into the map background, maintaining consistent line thickness and shading with the rest of the ink drawings, and do they not appear as disjointed or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases sea monster motifs blending into the map background. A close analysis posits that the motifs are uniformly integrated, maintaining consistent line thickness and shading in harmony with other ink drawings. Proper blending techniques and artistic style coherence ensure these elements do not appear disjointed or out of place.",
