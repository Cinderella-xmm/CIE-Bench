    "Question": "Q1: Does the packaging box maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor, especially in alignment with the base and handle, without any distorted edges or warped geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the packaging box presents a food processor image that maintains proportional alignment with its components. The base and handle of the food processor appear naturally integrated into the box design, without any indication of distortion or warping in the presentation. Visually, the box sides are parallel, and the overall geometry aligns with typical packaging standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the 'Waring' brand name clearly visible and properly aligned on the packaging without overlapping or distorting adjacent elements such as the appliance illustration or background?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the 'Waring' brand name is prominently displayed at the top of the box's front face. It is distinct, well-centered, and maintains uniform lettering. It does not interfere or overlap with adjacent elements, such as the processor illustration or the dark background, ensuring clear visibility and professional alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the isometric illustration of the food processor on the box accurately reflect the original object's geometry, including the feed tube, lid, and base, without distortion or incorrect angles?",
    "explanation": "The isometric illustration on the packaging in Image B accurately mirrors the original food processor's geometry. The feed tube, lid, and base are proportionally and geometrically consistent with the object shown, suggesting careful attention to realistic depiction without distortion or incorrect angles, which ensures the consumer receives a true representation of the product.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the exploded components of the food processor depicted with accurate shapes and positions, maintaining their original form and material texture without stretching or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The exploded view of the food processor parts in Image B is displayed with precision. Each component is correctly shaped and positioned, mimicking the real-life spatial arrangement. The forms retain their original material texture, avoiding any signs of visual stretching or blurriness that might result from poor graphic manipulation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging display natural material finishes without unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the box's design showcases the silver and black surfaces of the food processor with realism. The metallic silver achieves an authentic sheen without excessive reflection, and the matte black has a smooth, consistent finish without visible graininess or texture artifacts. This demonstrates a refined portrayal of material properties.",
    "answer": "Yes"
