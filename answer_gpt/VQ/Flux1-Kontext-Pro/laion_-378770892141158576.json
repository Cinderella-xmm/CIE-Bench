      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe appears to drape naturally over the seated figure, conforming to the body's contours and providing a realistic flow and fold consistent with a person seated on grass. The fabric does not exhibit any unnatural stretching or clumping, indicating the robe's design is intended to mimic natural fabric behavior, which aligns with common clothing manufacturing techniques for achieving realistic drapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the seated figure with limbs positioned in an anatomically plausible way. The arms and legs appear in proportion with realistic angles for a person seated leisurely outdoors. There are no visible distortions or disproportionate lengths in the limbs, following the basic principles of human anatomy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not provide visible details about the facial features due to the blurred face. However, assuming the depiction of larger eyes would be proportionally integrated into the character's face, it implies the artistic style aims for coherent facial representation without distortions, aligning with the cartoon-like or stylistic approach often seen in art.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the reflection in the lake and the mountain backdrop have a watercolor-like quality with gentle and smooth transitions. This appearance, typical of watercolor paintings, avoids sharp edges or stark lines and creates a realistic distance perspective, resonating with landscape art techniques used to portray serene outdoor scenes.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lilac-edged border uniformly applied around the image without overlapping or obscuring any part of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that each photograph in the photo album has a lilac-edged border applied evenly around the images, serving as a decorative element. The borders do not intrude upon or obscure the main scene, allowing the viewer to focus entirely on the visual content inside each photo, which aligns with typical photo album presentation styles.",
