      "question": "Do the facial features and accessories of the individuals appear detailed and clear despite the enlarged heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the heads of the individuals are noticeably larger than usual, suggesting an intentional edit. However, examining the clothing, accessories, and other elements surrounding the heads, we see that these components remain unchanged from their natural state. The scarves, hats, and other worn items appear intact and undistorted. This suggests that, while the facial features were altered or removed, the surrounding details and accessories have been preserved in their natural clarity without any added detail from the enlargement process.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the enlarged heads and the cartoonish bodies smooth and free from noticeable artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no obvious artifacts or mismatches that one would typically associate with poorly executed edits, like abrupt lines or visible pixelation at the connection points between heads and bodies. The integration is cohesive without noticeable giveaways of the alteration, suggesting a relatively smooth transition.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the individuals' bodies in relation to the log cabin realistic and consistent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the proportions of the individuals, when compared to the log cabin, appear natural and consistent. Based on common knowledge of human sizes relative to small structures like cabins, the individuals appear to be of realistic size, standing in a proportionate relation to the cabin. This portrayal maintains a believable scene typical of such settings.",

      "question": "Do the clothing and equipment retain their natural textures and details without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clothing and equipment, such as jackets, gloves, and ski poles, appear to retain their natural textures. These items display consistent detailing—such as seams, material folds, and shadows—characteristic of natural fabrics and standard equipment. This retention suggests no noticeable distortion or loss of detail in these objects through the conversion process from Image A to Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bodies of the individuals and the structure of the cabin maintain their geometric integrity, appearing undistorted. The lines and shapes are coherent and true to their expected forms—individuals have natural human body lines, and the cabin maintains its log construction appearance. Nothing suggests any warping or geometrical distortion.",
