    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the LEGO blocks forming the bookshelf and books have a uniform, smooth plastic texture throughout, with no residual wood grain or mixed material appearances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO blocks are visually depicted with a wooden texture instead of a smooth plastic texture typical of LEGO. This is evident from the intricate wood carvings and the realistic wooden appearance of the blocks, suggesting a material other than plastic and retaining the look from Image A.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the LEGO blocks uniformly earthy-toned (e.g., browns, tans, dark reds) and consistent with the original bookshelfâ€™s color scheme, without any unexpected or jarring color deviations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases a structure where the colors are earthy tones, similar to those seen in Image A, with browns and tans dominating the overall appearance. Both images maintain a consistent color palette representing wooden textures.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the darker LEGO bricks used for carvings clearly aligned and shaped to replicate the original decorative patterns on the spines and shelf edges without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the carvings and decorative elements are visible and align with the overall aesthetic of Image A, showing precision and clarity similar to the intricate details found in hand-crafted woodwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the top of the LEGO tower taper smoothly and symmetrically from the base upward, without jagged edges, irregular steps, or disproportionate narrowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tower in Image B is visually symmetrical and smooth from the base to the top, maintaining the design integrity similar to a carefully constructed architecture model. There are no visible irregularities that detract from the overall symmetrical tapering.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background behind the LEGO tower completely plain and muted, with no traces of the original textured wallpaper or lighting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background appears plain and muted, contrasting with the textured wallpaper seen in Image A. This creates a clean and unobtrusive background free of textures or lighting artifacts.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all LEGO blocks aligned perfectly in rows and columns, with no gaps, overlaps, or floating pieces that disrupt the modular structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of blocks in Image B demonstrates a careful alignment, reflecting the regular modular appearance of shelves, with no apparent gaps or irregularities. This mirrors a well-constructed assembly, maintaining the structured arrangement seen in Image A.",
