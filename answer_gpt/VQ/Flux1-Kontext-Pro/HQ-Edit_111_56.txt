    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the ballerina’s body show consistent marble texture with subtle chisel marks across all areas including arms, torso, legs, and face?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ballerina is depicted as a statue, showcasing a surface with a marble texture. This is evidenced by the smooth yet subtly uneven finish typical of carved marble, visible across the body's different regions - arms, torso, and legs. The consistent marble texture throughout suggests careful craftsmanship. The presence of subtle chisel marks can also be observed, characteristic of detailed stone sculptures. Such texture is uniform across all areas visible in the image, affirming that the statue maintains an authentic marble appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the folds and flow of the robe draped over the ballerina's body physically plausible and consistent with how heavy fabric would hang on a sculpted form?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robe draping the ballerina is sculpted to have a natural flow and folds that mimic the behavior of heavy fabric. The way it rests on the body and slightly flows toward the floor adds realism to the sculpture, suggesting weight and gravity acting on the garment. The folds are detailed and positioned in a manner consistent with the material's presumed thickness, confirming the heavy fabric's plausible representation in sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the laurel wreath positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape or causing misalignment with facial features?",
    "explanation": "In the visual analysis of Image B, a laurel wreath is positioned on the ballerina statue's head. It appears to be properly placed, following the natural contour of the head. The wreath does not cause any visible distortion of the skull shape, nor does it misalign with the facial features. The placement maintains symmetry and harmony with the head’s overall proportions, ensuring a coherent aesthetic usually observed in classical sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the feet retain proper human anatomy and alignment while appearing as carved stone, with no deformation or disproportionate elongation?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the ballerina's feet as part of a statue, rendered to reflect human anatomy accurately. Both feet rest on a base, maintaining anatomical proportions and alignment as expected from a natural stance. There is no visible deformation or elongation in the sculpting, and the feet are balanced and proportional relative to the rest of the body's structure. This reflects the artist's precision in capturing the anatomy within a stone medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the Ionic columns and mosaic floor aligned with the figure’s scale and perspective, showing no mismatch in depth or proportion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the Ionic columns and mosaic floor serve as the architectural backdrop for the statue. They are scaled according to the figure's size, neither overwhelming nor diminishing the statue's prominence. The columns enhance the setting without disrupting the visual proportion or depth. The mosaic floor aligns with the statue and columns, maintaining perspective consistency. This cohesively integrates the statue into its environment, avoiding any mismatch in scale.",
    "answer": "Yes"
