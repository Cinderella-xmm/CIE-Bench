      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "First, examining Image B, the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe appear to have correct proportions and geometric integrity. The lines are straight, and there are no visible distortions which suggest they have been crafted with precision. The architecture looks like a miniature replica, maintaining fidelity to the original structure. This analysis is based on the visual cues indicating symmetry and clean lines characteristic of precise architectural models, which are crucial for maintaining proportional accuracy. Therefore, the answer reflects careful attention to preserving the architectural elements in their correct form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm trees and cobblestone path are considerably integrated within the miniature environment inside the globe. They appear scaled appropriately in relation to the architectural features like the dome and arches, showing a coherent scene layout. The arrangement of the path leads naturally towards the entrance, indicating a logical flow seen in many garden and architectural designs. This analysis involves recognizing common design principles such as scale consistency and logical pathways leading to key structural entrances, ensuring landscapes complement architectural settings.",

      "question": "Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the Persian patterns on the globe's exterior demonstrate continuity and consistency with the known style of Persian patterns. They are evenly spaced and integrate the geometric and floral motifs characteristic of Persian ornamental design, aligning them with the tilework from the original building. While examining the globe, these intricate designs appear smooth and harmonious, reflecting an understanding of traditional Persian style. Therefore, the answer reflects a successful attempt at maintaining stylistic coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden highlights on the dome and arches are subtly applied, complementing the curvature and contours of the architecture. They exhibit realistic light interaction rather than being exaggerated. This analysis involves recognizing the natural behavior of light on metallic or glossy surfaces, where subtle highlights are used to suggest reflection without disrupting the original material's appearance. These highlights neither overpower the architectural design nor disrupt its integrity, indicating careful adjustment to simulate realistic light reflections.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon inspection of Image B, the intersection between the globe's interior scene and its exterior surface is smooth and precise. There are no noticeable uneven edges or transparency issues; the transition appears seamless. This conclusion is arrived at by examining the boundary's clarity and the absence of artifacts or inconsistencies, which are often signs of editing errors. The decision considers typical issues such as jagged cuts or mismatched reflections that could happen in transitions between different materials or surfaces, yet none are evident here.",
