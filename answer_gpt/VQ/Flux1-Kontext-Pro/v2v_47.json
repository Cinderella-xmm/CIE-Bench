      "question": "Does the kawaii enamel pin design retain the basic structure of the amphitheater, such as the tiered seating and arches, without introducing distortions like broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B, showcasing a kawaii enamel pin design, preserves the essential architectural elements of the amphitheater, such as tiered seating and arches. These structural components are evident in the design, which maintains coherent shapes and avoids fragmented or broken geometry. The interpretation of structure in enamel pin design often simplifies but does not distort foundational shapes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glossy metal outlines and bright enamel colors applied evenly, without creating unnatural textures or losing fine details of the amphitheater's features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The enamel pin design in Image B leverages smooth metal outlines and bright colors typical of such merchandise, providing a uniform texture that does not obscure detailed features such as arches and seating. Enamel pins inherently simplify texture but do so without compromising clarity or detail representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical characteristics of the amphitheater remain plausible within the context of a kawaii enamel pin design, avoiding any unrealistic scaling or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, while the design is stylized, it maintains plausible proportions relative to an enamel pin's design framework. Such pins often exaggerate or simplify features for aesthetic purposes without making proportions unrealistically distorted, which is consistent in this imagery.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a white background and square presentation typical of product mockups, enhancing focus on the enamel pin design's features. This layout supports clear visualization of the item's structural consistency and authenticity, as it helps to emphasize the pin's design elements without distraction.",
