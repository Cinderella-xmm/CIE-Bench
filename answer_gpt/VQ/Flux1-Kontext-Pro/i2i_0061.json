      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the watercolor effect applied across the image retain the structural coherence of the skater's pose and the ramp's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skater's pose, including the outstretched arms and bent legs, appears consistent and visually coherent in Image B, retaining the dynamic action. The ramp's form remains clearly identifiable, maintaining its shape even through the watercolor effect. This demonstrates that the structural coherence of the original image is preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the semi-abstract brushstrokes and blurred colors used for the ground and background buildings free from unnatural textures and artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor effect creates semi-abstract brushstrokes and smooth color transitions for the ground and background buildings. The artistic style using blurred colors produces a painterly quality typical of watercolors, which does not exhibit any noticeable unnatural textures or digital artifacts.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the skater’s body and clothing retained their proportions and physical rationality after applying the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watercolor style has been applied to the skater’s body and clothing, yet the proportions and physical structure remain unchanged in a way that respects human anatomy. The skater's form looks proportionate and realistic, suggesting no distortion has occurred.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the details on the skater's gray t-shirt and black shoes remain discernible after the watercolor treatment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observation of Image B, the watercolor technique causes some loss of detail in the skater's clothing due to the nature of the medium, which prioritizes broader strokes over fine details. Consequently, specific elements like the design on the gray t-shirt and the intricacies of the black shoes are less discernible compared to a realistic depiction.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the shapes and lines of the skater’s hands remained ergonomic and natural under the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shapes and positioning of the skater's hands, particularly the fingers, still appear natural and ergonomic. The watercolor transformation maintains the basic structure and form necessary for depicting a realistic human gesture.",
