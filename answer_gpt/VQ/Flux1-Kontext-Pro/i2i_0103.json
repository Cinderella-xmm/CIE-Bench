      "question": "Have the brushstrokes added to the sofa preserved its structural integrity without causing distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Van Gogh-style brushstrokes introduce a swirling and dynamic texture to the scene. When analyzing the sofa, the brushstrokes add a textured layer to the surface, consistent with the art style, and create a visual impression of movement and energy without fundamentally altering its shape. The sofa maintains its recognizable form, including the cushions and armrests, ensuring the structural integrity is intact despite the stylistic conversion. Therefore, the sofa's realistic form and proportions are preserved, as the brushstrokes variety adds visual interest but not distortion.",

      "question": "Does the wall, including the framed painting, appear naturally integrated with the rest of the room after the style conversion, without any broken geometric shapes or lost fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wall and framed painting have been adapted into the Van Gogh style with swirling and dynamic brushstrokes. The wall serves as the canvas for the distinct art style, with the paint effect creating a vivid backdrop. The wall remains flat and consistent in color tone, much like the original wall, while the painting in the frame is vivid and dynamic, blending seamlessly with the surrounding decor. The absence of broken geometric shapes or loss of details suggests successful integration, as elements within the painting also maintain their original proportions even in their stylistic conversion.",

      "question": "Are the plant's leaves depicted with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes while still retaining a recognizable and plausible appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plant leaves have been modified with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes, characterized by swirling textures and bright colors. These brushstrokes do not interfere with the clear recognition of the plant's shape and form. The leaves retain their natural shapes and logical arrangements on the plant stem, suggesting an artistic enhancement rather than distortion. There are no abrupt artifacts or unrealistic alterations that could affect the leaves' recognizability. Therefore, despite the style conversion, the plant remains identifiable and plausible.",

      "question": "Has the side table and lamp been converted to fit the Van Gogh style while preserving their realistic proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the side table and lamp display the characteristic Van Gogh swirling brushstrokes, creating a dynamic and textured effect. Despite the stylistic enhancement, both the table and the lamp remain in proportion, retaining their recognizable shapes and maintaining functionality. The details such as the lamp shade and the legs of the table are intact, ensuring realistic physical logic and absence of distortion. This suggests the blend of style conversion is successful, maintaining the essence of the objects without introducing warped or disproportionate features.",

      "question": "Do all elements in the room maintain a harmonious and plausible arrangement in Van Gogh style, ensuring no disruption in the spatial relationships among objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation into a Van Gogh-style art piece involves applying vibrant and textured brushstrokes across the entire image. These brushstrokes add energy and movement without negatively affecting the spatial arrangement among the room elements. Each object's position relative to others, such as the sofa, plant, and side table, remains unchanged and logically placed, reflecting the same harmonious setup observed in traditional interior layouts. As such, the room maintains a cohesive and plausible appearance, ensuring the elements do not disruptatively clash or shift among themselves.",
