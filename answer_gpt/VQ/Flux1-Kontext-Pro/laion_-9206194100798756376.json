      "question": "Is the crown positioned on the chicken's head in a way that maintains proportional size and natural integration with the skin texture, without visible seams or unnatural lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crown appears to be positioned appropriately on the chicken's head, fitting proportionally without appearing too large or small. The lighting and shadows are consistent with the rest of the image, and there are no visible seams or discrepancies in the skin texture around the crown. The integration looks natural and free from cut-and-paste appearances.",

      "question": "Are the cartoonish eyes placed symmetrically on the chicken's head with smooth contours and no jagged edges or misaligned shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoonish eyes on the chicken's head are symmetrical and aligned properly. The contours around the eyes are smooth and coherent, with no jagged edges. The shadows and highlights around the eyes match the lighting source in the scene, providing a seamless and natural appearance.",

      "question": "Does the throne structure beneath the chicken maintain consistent depth and alignment with the plateâ€™s surface, without floating or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the throne structure on which the chicken is seated aligns properly with the surface of the plate. There are no apparent floating elements or inconsistent overlaps between the throne and the plate. The depth and perspective appear consistent with the visual cues and setting of the image.",

      "question": "Are the anthropomorphic features on the vegetables (such as eyes or limbs) seamlessly blended into their surfaces without visible pixelation, texture breaks, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic features on the vegetables, like the eyes, are well-blended into their respective surfaces. There is no visible pixelation or breaks in texture that would disrupt the smooth surface of the vegetables. The shading around these features is consistent, ensuring a natural and seamless integration.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the candles, ornaments, and foliage vivid but free from oversaturation, haloing, or loss of fine detail such as pine needle tips or glass reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the candles, ornaments, and foliage are bright and vivid without crossing into oversaturation. The fine details such as the tips of pine needles and glass reflections on ornaments are preserved, showing clear details without any haloing or blurring effects. The overall color balance maintains a natural and appealing look consistent throughout the image.",
