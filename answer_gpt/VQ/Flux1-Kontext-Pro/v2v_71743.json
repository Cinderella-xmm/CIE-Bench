      "question": "Does the transformed texture of the paint splatter maintain a natural appearance without introducing any unnatural artifacts or disrupting the visual flow of the guitar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the paint splatter texture appears well-integrated with the guitar image. The splatter effect is common in artistic designs and matches the abstract concept of seamlessly blending different visual styles. There are no visible artifacts or awkward transitions disrupting the overall visual coherence. The guitar itself maintains its form amidst the overlay, suggesting a well-executed design that aligns with a vibrant, artistic concept.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the guitar's proportions and physical structure preserved, avoiding any distortion or unnatural deformation after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the guitars are visually intact with no signs of distortion in their physical structure. The proportions remain as expected for electric guitars, and there is no indication of warping or deformation due to the paint texture overlay. This suggests that the transformation process preserves the structural integrity of the guitar while altering its external aesthetic.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the guitar, like strings and pickups, been maintained without any loss or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the guitars show detailed elements such as strings, frets, and pickups preserved clearly. The paint texture does not obscure these components, and there is no evidence of unnatural textures interfering with these fine details. This indicates that the transformation respects and maintains the intricate parts of the guitar’s design.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B’s design incorporates vibrant and textured visual elements that harmonize with the book’s concept of artistic and abstract guitar imagery. The overlays are consistent across the different variants, thus maintaining visual coherence within the given aesthetic framework. No inconsistent design features disrupt the thematic unity, indicating a successful integration of new design elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'NEW YORK Guitar Method' is prominently displayed in each book cover version. It is placed against a solid-colored background and uses a contrasting color font, ensuring its visibility and clarity. Despite changes in style, the title remains distinct and unobscured by other design elements, maintaining its legibility and impact.",
