      "question": "Does the truck maintain its original proportions and structural integrity without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is illustrated with proportions that remain consistent with what one would expect from a standard semi-truck. The outline and structure retain their typical geometric integrity, as evident in the contours of the cab, grille, and wheels. Based on knowledge of trucks, there are no visible signs indicating structural distortion or broken shapes, suggesting the truck's design maintains expected proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the surfaces and textures of the truck, such as the wheels, cab, and grille, free from unnatural artifacts and retain appropriate levels of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized version with simplified textures fitting a cartoon or illustration style. While detailed textures akin to realistic or high-definition imagery are not present, this is consistent with the artistic style employed. Therefore, the surfaces appear free from unnatural artifacts that would disrupt the intended visual style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the cab's vibrant colors appear natural against the truck's materials and lighting conditions, ensuring material consistency and avoiding unrealistic contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image employs a bright, vibrant shade for the truck cab that fits within a cartoon-styled depiction. The color usage is intentionally exaggerated, a common trait in illustrated imagery that aims for visual impact rather than realism. Thus, given the context, these vibrant colors are harmoniously integrated without clashing with the surrounding illustrated scene.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the simplified background naturally integrated with the truck, maintaining the overall authenticity of the scene without introducing distracting or out-of-place elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background is simpler and matches the truck's illustrated style, featuring basic shapes and colors that echo the truck's cartoon-like design. The scene maintains a visual coherence expected in stylized art, where background and foreground elements are intentionally designed to complement each other. Therefore, the background does not contain out-of-place elements and integrates well with the truck.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wheels maintain their structural and physical logic, with no signs of distortion or misalignment, thereby preserving the truck's visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the wheels with round, neatly aligned shapes in keeping with the stylized aesthetic. The wheels are placed correctly relative to the truck's structure, and despite the simplified appearance, they retain a logic consistent with typical truck construction. Consequently, there are no elements that suggest distortion or misalignment.",
