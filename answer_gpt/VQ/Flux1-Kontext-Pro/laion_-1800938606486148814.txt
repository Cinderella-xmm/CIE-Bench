    "Question": "Q1: Does the transparent upper material appear smooth and uniform without visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity across the shoe's surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoe does not have any visible signs of a transparent material exhibiting pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent opacity. The design and color are uniform and consistent across the entire surface. Therefore, given the absence of these anomalies commonly associated with poor digital rendering, the shoe's material appears smooth and uniform.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the neon blue glow around the Swoosh evenly distributed with smooth transitions and no abrupt color shifts or light leaks into neighboring surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there is no neon blue glow present around the Swoosh. The shoe is gray, and the Swoosh is black, without any indication of glowing effects. This means there is no glow distributed, so the question of even distribution and smooth transitions does not apply.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the digital screen on the strap properly aligned with the strapâ€™s curvature, showing clear and stable animation content without pixelation or visual noise?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the strap does not feature a digital screen. It is a plain strap with a quilted pattern. As there is no digital screen present, the question of alignment and clarity of animation content does not apply.",
    "answer": "No"
}

    "Question": "Q4: Does the digital shoe box exhibit consistent geometry and metallic reflection patterns without warped edges or misaligned holographic layers?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show a digital shoe box or anything resembling a shoe box. The image solely focuses on the shoe itself. Therefore, there is no content to analyze regarding a shoe box's geometry or metallic reflection patterns.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the geometric patterns on the shoe box evenly spaced and aligned with the surface contours, without repeating anomalies or misregistration?",
    "explanation": "There are no visible geometric patterns on a shoe box in Image B, as the image only contains the shoe without additional packaging or accessories. Hence, there are no patterns to assess for spacing or alignment.",
    "answer": "No"
