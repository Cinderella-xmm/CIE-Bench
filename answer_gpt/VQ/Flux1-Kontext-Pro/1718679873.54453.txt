    "Question": "Q1: Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robot is encased in a display case as a miniature model. Observing the model's body, limbs, and joints, it seems that the proportions have been scaled down uniformly while retaining their original form. There are no signs of stretching, compression, or misaligned joints that would distort the shape of the robot. This indicates that the scaling process preserved the original geometric integrity and proportions of the robot.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
    "explanation": "The display case in Image B appears to have a smooth, transparent surface. The lighting and reflections on the glass suggest natural light interaction, as the highlights and glares are consistent with how glass should look under light. The case exhibits clean edges without any visible jagged lines or overly sharp edges, and there are no double outlines or artifacts present that would suggest a flaw in the rendering or editing of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robotâ€™s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, while some details are observed, the focus is primarily on the exterior of the robot model and the glass case covering it. Due to the scaling and position, individual gears and mechanical parts are not prominently or distinctly visible under transparent panels or elsewhere on the robot. Given this, it's challenging to ascertain alignment or the presence of anomalies in detail from the visible data.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The hexagonal base in Image B looks geometrically precise with straight and consistent edges, indicating accurate rendering. The surface finish appears evenly matte-black, consistent across the entire base. The model number text 'MODEL 58' on the base is sharp, with no signs of haloing or distortion, making it easy to read and visually appealing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
    "explanation": "Within the display case of Image B, there is a small landscape scene. The tiny trees and ground textures are proportionally scaled to fit the miniature model environment, matching the scale of the display. However, the distant cityscape elements do not appear in Image B, as it focuses on the robot model within its protective case. This leads to a perceived spatial consistency error due to the absence of additional background elements.",
    "answer": "No"
