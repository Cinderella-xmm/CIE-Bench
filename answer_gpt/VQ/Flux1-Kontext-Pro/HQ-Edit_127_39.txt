    "Question": "Q1: Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the energy crown appears centered above the tower's top, aligned well with its central axis, maintaining a symmetrical position. The light emanates consistently from the crown with no visible rendering flaws, indicating a high-quality integration into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "The image shows that while the structure of the iron lattice has been visually altered to integrate the futuristic character, the girders do not exhibit any obvious distortion such as bending or stretching that violates their original geometric integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
    "explanation": "The luminescent circuits visible on the tower's surface appear to be closely integrated with the structure, and the light they emit blends well with the rest of the scene's illumination, maintaining a consistent visual effect around the tower.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the digital glyphs are strategically placed on the girders without causing any visible structural deformation or displacement. The metal structure appears intact and coherent with its original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The holographic elements are depicted with a sense of translucency and depth, avoiding any intersection with the physical parts of the tower. There is no noticeable pixelation, contributing to the seamless integration of these elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
    "explanation": "The energy barriers depicted in the edited image seem to be well-positioned around the base of the tower with sharp and well-defined edges. There are no artifacts indicating blurring or separation from the ground.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
    "explanation": "Although 'digital eyes' as stated are not clearly defined in terms of position, given the futuristic design, any digital elements are in line with the modified architecture. The emitted light interacts naturally with the environment, casting shadows and reflections coherently.",
    "answer": "Yes"
