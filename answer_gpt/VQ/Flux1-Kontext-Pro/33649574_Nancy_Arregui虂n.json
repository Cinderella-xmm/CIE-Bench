        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's feathers display a vibrant and smooth gradient of fiery colors, with a rich blend of reds, oranges, and yellows. The transition between these colors is fluid and does not show any noticeable banding, pixelation, or abrupt color transitions. This smooth gradient contributes to the overall fiery and dynamic appearance of the rooster, which is visually continuous across its feathers.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rooster's tail appears to transition seamlessly into smoke-like tendrils. These tendrils are continuous and seem to emanate naturally from the tail's end without any noticeable disconnection or sharp cutoffs. The visual effect is one of graceful transformation, enhancing the dynamic and ethereal look of the edited image.",

      "question": "Are the molten gold accents seamlessly blended into the wing and crest surfaces, showing depth and reflection consistent with metallic material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gold accents on the wings and crest appear to be well-integrated into the overall coloration, giving a reflective and metallic impression. The depiction of these accents implies depth and a sense of reflection consistent with how metallic surfaces interact with light. These elements enhance the rooster's majestic appearance while maintaining a cohesive look.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flame-like eyes seem to maintain the original shape and size typical of a rooster's eyes. Despite their fiery appearance, they do not seem to distort or alter the surrounding facial features such as the beak and comb. This consistency ensures that the rooster retains its fundamental anatomical characteristics.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the rune patterns are present and visible on the talons. These patterns are proportionate and do not appear to be oversized or warped. They respect the natural shape and contours of the talons, maintaining the realistic texture while adding an element of fantasy. This precise enhancement preserves the integrity of the rooster's feet.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
