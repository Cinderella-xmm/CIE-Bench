      "question": "Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a cat sculpture made of quartz and obsidian crystals. The cat's body appears well-formed and consistent for a crystal sculpture, maintaining the overall shape and proportions of a real cat. There are no visible warping or unnatural breaks in its construction, and the conversion to a crystal form retains logical anatomical features. This suggests a careful transformation from the original to this form, maintaining the essence of the feline shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's eyes are made of emerald crystal. They are positioned symmetrically within the eye sockets, and their size and shape are consistent with the overall facial structure. The reflective qualities are appropriate for a crystal material, adding to the lifelike appearance of the sculpture's eyes. These attributes align with the expectations for the original facial structure of a real cat.",

      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the cat's front paws and hind legs resting naturally on a wooden block. There are no visible signs of floating or disconnection from this base. The pose is balanced, as would be required for a physically logical sculpture resting on a surface. This adherence to physical logic indicates a thoughtful construction of the positioning on the block.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystalline surfaces of the cat in Image B have realistic textural qualities expected of quartz and obsidian. There is a natural variation in translucency and shading, with well-defined edges typical of these materials. This realism is achieved without pixelation or a distractingly unnatural smoothness, which can often appear in synthetic renderings. These surface characteristics contribute to the sculpture's believable appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing both images, the wooden block in Image B has a similar texture, color, and lighting to Image A. The block supports the cat sculpture solidly and casts appropriate shadows, which enhances the realism of the setup. There are no unnatural gaps or distortions between the cat and the block, which suggests that the edited image has maintained visual consistency with the original in these aspects.",
