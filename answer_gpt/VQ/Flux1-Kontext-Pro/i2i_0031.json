        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents cartoon-like depictions of a lifeguard tower and a rescue vehicle.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the icons show well-defined proportions consistent with typical representations of vehicles and towers.

      "question": "Are the minimalist icons integrated seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall visual plausibility and authenticity of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts minimalist, stylized icons placed on a blank background, which reduces any interaction with a physical scene. As standalone symbols, they fit naturally within their context as iconographic representations, intended for immediate recognition rather than realistic integration into a photographic scene. As such, their integration is seamless within the intended use of iconography, maintaining a plausible and authentic representation within the style.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The icons in Image B are designed in a minimalist style, employing clean lines and solid color fills which eliminate the presence of fine details one would expect in a detailed photograph. This transition is successful in presenting clear and noise-free representations, common in minimalist design, emphasizing clarity and simplicity without fine details.",

      "question": "Do the minimalist safety icons exhibit clean edges and distinct color blocks consistent with airport signage styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows icons with clearly defined, smooth edges and the use of flat, contrasting color blocks â€” specifically yellow for the vehicle and a combination of gray and orange for the tower. This style is akin to visual languages used in airport signage, aiming for visibility and easy recognition. The icons maintain this stylistic convention throughout their depiction.",
