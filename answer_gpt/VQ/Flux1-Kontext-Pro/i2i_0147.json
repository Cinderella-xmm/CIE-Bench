      "question": "Does the melted cheese appear with a natural texture and color, without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the melted cheese is drizzled over the hot dogs. Its texture appears smooth and consistent with how cheese typically melts, forming strings and curves over the sausages and buns. The color is a light yellow-orange which is typical for melted cheese, and no strange discoloration or pixelation is visible, which indicates there are no unnatural artifacts present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fried onions positioned naturally on the hot dog, avoiding any distortion or breakage of geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the fried onions visible on the hot dogs are scattered in small pieces, which follows their typical placement when sprinkled over food. They maintain irregular shapes that are consistent with fried onions' crispy texture without showing signs of distortion or unnatural geometric alignments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the melted cheese and fried onions blend seamlessly with the hot dog buns and sausages, preserving structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the melted cheese blends into the top surface of the sausages and buns. The drizzling of the cheese aligns smoothly with the contours of the hot dogs, and the fried onions are distributed casually and naturally over the sausages. The integration appears seamless, with no evident inconsistencies in structural alignment between these elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the melted cheese and fried onions preserved without losing clarity or introducing blurry textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon analyzing Image B, the melted cheese appears sharp and well-defined with clear linear patterns visible as it drips over the sausages, indicating good preservation of details. The fried onions similarly retain their crispy appearance without any blurred effect, completing well-defined textural representation.",

      "question": "Does the barbecue tong look naturally placed near the grill, maintaining its structural integrity and proportion with the rest of the image elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barbecue tong rests on the grill alongside the sausages. It is positioned at a realistic angle and proportion that corresponds to standard usage of grilling utensils. The tong's metallic texture and visual alignment with other grill elements are consistent, maintaining its structural integrity without distortion.",
