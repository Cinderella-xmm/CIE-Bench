    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the figure proportionally scaled and positioned within the globe such that her body parts (especially limbs and head) maintain natural anatomical alignment and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is seated and positioned naturally within the globe. Her arms are resting in a natural posture and are not stretched or compressed. The head is aligned appropriately with the body, maintaining the proportions seen in a seated figure. Natural anatomical alignment is preserved, suggesting that the scaling and positioning within the globe are handled properly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle clearly visible and free from blurring, aliasing, or loss of fine detail after conversion to a 3D model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the intricate patterns on the dress and the braided hairstyle are meticulously represented, without apparent blurring or loss of detail. The colors and definition of the patterns are clear, and the texture of the braids is visible, indicating attention to detail in maintaining these elements during conversion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wall patterns inside the globe accurately reflect the colors and shapes of the dress's pattern without warping, misalignment, or color deviation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns inside the globe reflect similar colors and shapes found on the dress worn by the figure. The geometric shapes and color combinations are consistent with those on the dress. There is no noticeable warping or color deviation, suggesting accurate reflection and alignment of these patterns within the globe.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature roots beneath the figure arranged in a way that follows natural growth patterns and does not intersect or distort the figureâ€™s legs or skirt?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature roots in Image B are arranged in a manner that appears natural, weaving around but not disrupting or intersecting the figure's skirt or legs. This careful placement provides the effect of roots emerging naturally without distorting the figure sitting above them.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the miniature animals positioned at ground level with proper shadowing and scale relative to the figure, and do they have natural textures and forms without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature animals are situated around the figure with a sense of scale that matches their environment. They appear appropriately sized relative to the figure, with consistent textures and lacking visible artifacts. The shadowing under the animals indicates a realistic positioning on the ground level.",
