    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is rendered as part of a marble sculpture, which typically displays natural variations in texture and depth, intrinsic to marble work. The curls appear consistent with this expectation, with detailed and coherent shading that gives the impression of depth without visible artifacts.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornamental carvings are seamlessly integrated with the anatomical structure of the chest and shoulders, matching the musculature's contour faithfully and maintaining coherent shape continuity, which suggests careful alignment and adherence to the underlying form.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The angelic figures in Image B appear to be sculpted into the backdrop with sufficient depth and relief that matches the central figure's three-dimensional feel. Their proportions are logical, maintaining their integrity without distortion or fragmentation, thus contributing to the spatial harmony of the image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is rendered using a monochrome marble texture, which displays smooth tonal gradients typical of marble sculptures. There are no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas, which confirms that the image's conversion from color to monochrome was uniformly executed without artifacting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both hands in Image B are depicted with five fingers each. The rendering of finger articulation demonstrates realistic anatomy, with appropriate joint positions and proportions, without any signs of fused digits, elongation, or unnatural bending.",
