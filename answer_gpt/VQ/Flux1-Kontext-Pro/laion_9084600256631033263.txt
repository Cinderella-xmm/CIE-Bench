    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass bottle form retain the original car’s side profile and curvature without visible warping or disproportionate scaling?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the edited car maintains its identifiable side profile and curvature similar to what would be expected of the original vehicle. There is no visible warping or disproportionate scaling that would distort the car's shape. The editing seems to preserve the dimensions and proportions that are typical of the car’s design. Hence, considering the continuity of the side profile and curvature without distortion, the conclusion is drawn.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the faceted glass stoppers aligned with the original headlight positions and do they show consistent lighting and reflection patterns with the surrounding glass?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not show faceted glass stoppers aligned with the original headlight positions. Instead, the image features a large glass ornament on top of the car that resembles a stopper. The lighting and reflection patterns are focused on this central ornate feature rather than being integrated with the headlight positions, indicating the headlight design remains unchanged.",

The reflections and highlights on the car are smooth, appearing to follow the contour without abrupt transitions or artificial sheen. This creates a consistent and realistic appearance reflecting natural lighting scenarios.",
