    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire cathedral structure appear uniformly rendered in warm stained wood with consistent grain patterns and realistic wood textures across all surfaces, including spires, arches, and tracery?",
    "explanation": "Analyze Image B, which depicts the cathedral model inside a shadow box. The cathedral appears to be constructed entirely out of wood, with distinct grain patterns visible throughout the surface. The wooden material is rendered uniformly, giving the structure a consistent appearance across all architectural elements such as spires, arches, and tracery. This matches the visual cues of warm stained wood with realistic textures. Combine this with world knowledge of shadow box displays that often use wood for visual consistency and tactile appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the edges of the shadow box clearly defined, structurally coherent, and proportionally sized relative to the cathedral model, with no visible gaps, misalignments, or floating components?",
    "explanation": "Based on Image B, the shadow box surrounding the cathedral model has well-defined edges. The frame appears structurally coherent, uniformly enclosing the model without visible gaps or misalignments. The scale of the shadow box is proportionate to the cathedral model, providing ample space while maintaining coherence in its proportions relative to the miniature structure within. There are no floating components in the image, demonstrating a realistic presentation typical in such displays.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the tiny pews and chandeliers positioned correctly within the interior of the cathedral model, maintaining proper scale and alignment with architectural features like columns and vaults, and do they cast consistent shadows?",
    "explanation": "Inspecting Image B, the tiny pews and chandeliers are part of the setup in front of the cathedral model. Their position reflects an exterior placement rather than an interior arrangement within the model itself, which questions alignment with architectural features inside the cathedral model. Shadows cast by these items do not affect the interior's architectural features. World knowledge suggests miniature models often focus less on interior furniture placement due to scale challenges.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the clock mechanism located at the back of the model, featuring visible gears and a moving path for small figures, with no distorted shapes, inconsistent materials, or implausible motion trajectories?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the clock mechanism is placed within the shadow box but lacks visible gears or a defined moving path for figures. It serves as a static decorative element rather than a mechanical system with functional components. The visual cues do not support an active clock mechanism with motion trajectories, indicating distorted shapes or implausible functionality. The world knowledge of decorative models within shadow boxes confirms this limitation in mechanical authenticity.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the intricate gothic carvings, including the rose window, flying buttresses, and sculptural elements, retain sharp detail and accurate geometry in the miniature model without visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the detailed gothic carvings of the cathedral model with considerable clarity. The rose window, flying buttresses, and intricate sculptural elements are depicted with sharp detail and accurate geometry, reflecting the precision typical in well-crafted miniature models. There is no visible blurring, pixelation, or deformation of these features, indicating high-quality craftsmanship and attention to detail consistent in such replicas.",
    "answer": "Yes"
