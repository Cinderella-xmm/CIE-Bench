      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the neon accents added to the motorcycle’s body emitting a consistent, smooth glow without harsh edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, we see the neon accents on the motorcycle's body that give a futuristic glow. The key is to evaluate if this glow appears consistent and smooth. In examining the accents, there are no apparent jarring transitions or pixelation, which suggests that the lighting effect maintains a cohesive and realistic glow, typical of digital alterations meant to enhance aesthetics without causing distraction.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the hover wheels maintain symmetrical, closed geometric forms without visible deformation or broken spokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a motorcycle that integrates hover wheels, recognized by the absence of standard tires and the increased spacing typical of futuristic design. The examination of these hover wheels indicates that they maintain their integrity with symmetrical and consistent shapes, void of any deformation or broken elements, portraying a cohesive design that aligns with futuristic vehicle concepts.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the digital interface seamlessly embedded in the front panel without intersecting or obscuring existing elements like the headlight or mirrors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By examining Image B, there is an implicit suggestion of a digital interface possibly integrated onto the motorcycle's dashboard. For a seamless integration, the interface should be distinct from and unobtrusive to existing components such as the headlight or mirrors. Given the visual analysis, no intersection or obscuration of these elements occurs, indicating that the digital interface's integration is realized without interference.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the isometric box exhibit uniform edge lengths and correct angles, with no skewed faces or misaligned corners?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B involves an isometric box design typically used in packaging to provide a structured, visually balanced appearance. By scrutinizing the box edges and corners in the photo, the consistent uniformity in edge lengths and absence of skewed angles or misaligned corners reaffirms the structural correctness and balanced proportions throughout the packaging, indicative of precise digital work aimed at maintaining design integrity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transparent window free of warping, chromatic aberration, or ghosting that would distort the view of the motorcycle behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transparent window serves as packaging, providing visibility to the motorcycle model inside. A noteworthy criterion is its clarity—an effective window should exhibit no warping or visual blemishes such as chromatic aberration or ghosting. Upon reviewing the visual clarity through the window, there is no noticeable distortion or coloring issues, ensuring that the motorcycle view remains sharp and undistorted.",
