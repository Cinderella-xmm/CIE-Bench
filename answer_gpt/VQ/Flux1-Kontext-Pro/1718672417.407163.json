      "question": "Are the braids on the alpaca’s neck and head seamlessly integrated with metallic ornaments and amulets without visible texture mismatches or broken strands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids on the alpaca’s neck and head are adorned with metallic ornaments and amulets. The integration of these elements appears smooth and well-blended, with no visible texture mismatches or broken strands where the ornaments are placed. The continuity of the hair strands and the seamless placement of the metallic pieces suggest a cohesive design. This indicates that the integration of ornaments is well-executed, leading to a realistic appearance.",

      "question": "Do the newly added Norse-style garments around the alpaca’s body show coherent patterns and visible runic inscriptions without jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Norse-style garments around the alpaca's body are detailed with intricate patterns and visible runic inscriptions.

      "question": "Are the standing stones in the background positioned naturally within the forest scene, with proper scale, shadowing, and mist effects that match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon observing the background in Image B, the standing stones are depicted within a forest setting. The scale of the stones appears proportional to the trees and other elements within the environment, contributing to a natural look. The shadowing on the stones aligns with the lighting conditions, and the presence of mist effects adds depth and coherence to the scene, allowing the stones to blend naturally into the backdrop.",

      "question": "Are the metallic components and amulets in the braids anchored realistically, with no floating elements or unnatural angles that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the metallic components and amulets within the braids in Image B, they appear to be anchored realistically. Each ornament and amulet is aligned in such a way that it seems to be naturally draped within the hair strands. There are no observable floating elements or angles that appear awkward or disjointed, indicating that the integration is handled effectively without disrupting the natural flow of the hair.",

      "question": "Are the alpaca’s facial features, including eyes, nose, and mouth, proportionally correct and aligned with the rest of the head despite added accessories and styling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Although the face is blurred and cannot be evaluated in this specific context, assumptions about facial feature alignment and proportions are based on how the rest of the image handles consistency. However, the question cannot be answered accurately due to the blurred modification obscuring these details.",
