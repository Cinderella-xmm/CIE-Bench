    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass finish on the ship's hull and superstructure appears smooth and consistent. The texture is uniform, and there are no visible signs of cracks or pixelation, which often occur in poor quality edits. Additionally, mismatched shading would typically result in uneven color distribution, none of which is present here. The shading follows the curvature of the ship's structure naturally.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures on the dock seem to resemble people more than automatons, but for the sake of analysis, assuming they are automatons, they appear to have properly articulated limbs and clothing that fits their bodies without visible issues. The hands appear to have the correct number of fingers, although the small scale used in the image may limit the ability to see fine details. There are no noticeable visual anomalies like unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric.",

      "question": "Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass lantern is clearly defined with a seamless transparent enclosure around the ship scene. The glass is cleanly rendered with visible reflections suggesting a smooth surface, and it is framed with visible metal elements around the top and bottom. There are no sections missing or overlapping that would disrupt the integrity of the enclosure.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam clouds within the lantern in Image B have smooth gradients, and the edges appear soft and well-integrated with the scene. They float naturally, without jagged borders or harsh lines that would indicate poor editing. The colors are uniform and natural without sudden shifts that would detract from the realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the flags are placed where they would be on an actual ship, for example at the top of the mast. Their orientation and size don’t seem to negatively affect or distort the spatial relationships within the scene, preserving a realistic scale. The compasses, or similar navigational elements, are not prominently visible but existing visual elements are logically placed.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, any mechanical components or gears appear to be well-integrated with the ship's structure. They are visibly supported and follow the contours of the ship correctly. There are no indications of components floating without attachment or intersecting the structure in a physically impossible way.",
