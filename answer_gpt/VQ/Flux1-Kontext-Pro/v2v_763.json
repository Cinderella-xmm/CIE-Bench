      "question": "Does the transition between the realistic baseball field and the chibi-themed environment appear smooth without any noticeable breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the portal acts as a transition between the realistic baseball field and the chibi-themed environment. The glowing portal is designed to blend the two settings, visually suggesting a passage between different worlds. It seamlessly integrates, contributing to a smooth transition without any abrupt visual breaks or distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the baseball player's uniform preserved naturally in the chibi-style depiction without any loss or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style depiction simplifies and stylizes the player's uniform, focusing on exaggerated proportions and a more cartoonish aesthetic. Details such as texture in the fabric or realistic shading can be reduced in favor of a more simplified appearance typical of chibi art style, so there might be a notable change from detailed realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the baseball player's body parts, such as arms and legs, remain consistent and credible in the chibi-style depiction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Chibi-style typically exaggerates body proportions, using shorter limbs and a larger head to create a playful and stylized look. In Image B, the proportions are altered to fit this art style, which may not remain consistent with realistic human anatomy, leading to credible disproportions.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the glowing portal integrate naturally with the surrounding environment without introducing any unnatural artifacts or disrupting the overall visual appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a glowing portal that creates a visual boundary between two realms. The portal is smoothly integrated, its glowing effect visually consistent with the chibi aesthetic without introducing any apparent artifacts or disruptions, effectively merging the different visual elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the depiction of the viewer's hand being drawn into the chibi baseball realm look authentic and plausible without any unnatural distortions or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the viewerâ€™s hand is shown reaching into the portal leading to the chibi baseball realm. This transition between realms maintains a consistent and coherent style, and despite the stylized setting, it convincingly depicts the interaction between different environments without unnatural distortions.",
