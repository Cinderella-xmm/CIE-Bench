      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard retains a visually convincing structure despite being rendered in a 3D cartoon style. The wheels, deck, and design are coherent and comparable to real-world skateboards. Using world knowledge, the skateboard aligns with commonly known skateboard designs and proportions, confirming its structural consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and details of the skater's clothing natural and free of artifacts in the 3D cartoon rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures and details of the skater's clothing, such as the jacket and shirt, appear smooth and consistent with a cartoon style. The absence of visual artifacts like glitches or distortions supports the cartoon's natural rendering. Using world knowledge, well-rendered clothing should maintain texture uniformity, which is evident here.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the skill stats and bars appear naturally integrated into the character card without disrupting the overall visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skill stats and bars are neatly embedded into the borders of the character card design. World knowledge about character cards suggests that well-integrated elements enhance the design rather than detract from it. Here, the stats and bars complement the card's structure and do not appear out of place, maintaining a harmonious visual flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the skater's pose and body proportions depicted naturally and without distortion in the 3D cartoon aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater maintains a natural pose with realistic body proportions, consistent with a cartoon style but avoiding exaggeration that could lead to distortions. Using world knowledge, skaters are often portrayed dynamically, and this image captures that energy without misrepresenting anatomical accuracy.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the urban scenery and clear sky background enhance the skater and skateboard's visual credibility without introducing structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the urban scenery and clear sky create a believable environment that complements the skater and skateboard. World knowledge associates skateboarding with urban settings, and the use of simplified yet accurate backgrounds supports the visual theme without causing structural inconsistencies.",
