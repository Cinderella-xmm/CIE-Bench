      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the curled horn-like structures on both armrests have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Based on Image B analysis, the horn-like structures on the armrests appear to be smoothly integrated into the armrest design, maintaining a consistent thickness and without displaying jagged edges. Visually, they seem crafted with continuity in mind, forming a uniform curve that maintains the original design flow of the sofa's armrest. This suggests a deliberate design choice to keep these structures visually appealing.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bark-textured scales on the backrest evenly distributed, with natural variations in shape and depth, and do they follow the original contour of the sofa without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the bark-textured scales appear to be evenly distributed across the backrest, displaying natural variations that imitate real bark, such as differing shapes and depths. They align well with the original contour of the sofa, seemingly respecting the natural curve and structure without exhibiting misalignment or tearing, contributing to a natural and coherent design.",

      "question": "Does the mossy, leafy mane extend continuously from the top of the cushions, showing layered depth and natural variation in green tones, without sharp seams or floating leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mossy, leafy mane in Image B extends seamlessly across the top of the cushions, demonstrating a layered depth that mimics organic growth. There are variations in the green tones, giving it a realistic appearance, and it flows naturally without the presence of sharp seams or floating leaves, integrating well into the sofa's design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald eyes positioned centrally above the middle cushion, emitting a soft, diffused glow that casts subtle shadows on the surrounding leather without harsh outlines or overexposure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the emerald eyes are centrally positioned above the middle cushion. They emit a glow, but upon closer inspection, it is not entirely soft or diffused, as it shows a somewhat intense brightness that creates more defined outlines rather than subtle shadows. This indicates a slight deviation from the intended effect of a soft and natural glow.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wooden limbs extend from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet, with vines wrapped around clawed ends that appear structurally sound and proportionate to the sofa's size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the wooden limbs extending from under the front edge of the sofa with clawed ends wrapping around the carpet. The proportion seems balanced relative to the sofa's dimensions, and the structure appears sound with attention to detail in the vine wrapping around the claws, suggesting they are securely integrated and designed with proportionate scale in mind.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, localized glows or energy effects near the limbs or eyes that blend into the environment without creating visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of Image B reveals that while the emerald eyes glow, this glow appears intense enough to potentially result in visible artifacts like harsher outlines, which might imply pixelation or a lack of seamless blending into the environment. There is no overt evidence of pixelation or unnatural color bleeding near the limbs, but the intensity of the glow from the eyes suggests a less integrated visual effect.",
