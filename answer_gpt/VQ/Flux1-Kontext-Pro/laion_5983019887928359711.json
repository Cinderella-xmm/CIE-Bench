    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the hair exhibit consistent curl patterns and volumetric continuity without visible distortions such as broken strands, unnatural bulges, or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair displays smooth, elegant curls that are consistent with typical 18th-century styled wigs, reflecting attention to continuity and volume in their flow. The curls maintain a similar thickness throughout, avoiding abrupt changes or distortions. This suggests careful digital rendering or a well-maintained physical replica. The analysis involves recognizing the styling patterns typical of the era and assessing the visual continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the golden embroidery patterns evenly spaced and continuous along the red coat, with no jagged edges or missing segments that suggest artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embroidery patterns on the red coat in Image B are intricate and uniformly spaced, illustrating a high level of detail usually seen in decorative garments of historical figures. The patterns do not show signs of irregularity or digital artifacting, signifying a well-executed design or digitally retouched image. Knowledge of embroidery and historical fashion assists in evaluating the precision and continuity of the pattern.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the blue sash follow a smooth, gravity-consistent drape from the shoulder to the waist without unnatural creases or overlapping inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blue sash descends naturally over the figure's shoulder to the waist. The folds and flow appear consistent with how such sashes would behave, influenced by gravity, with a smooth drape and no obvious unnatural folds or overlaps. This analysis involves understanding how fabric behaves under gravity and its appearance in paintings or sculptures.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the surfaces of the coat, sash, and skin show coherent shading and specular reflections that align with a single light source, avoiding inconsistent gloss or floating highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a coherent shading pattern for the coat, sash, and skin, indicating a single light source illuminating the figure. The gloss and highlights are consistently positioned across the surfaces, suggesting careful lighting judgments typical in both digital rendering and classical portraiture. This requires understanding light behavior and assessing visual coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the white lace cravat properly aligned with the neck and collar, with no distortion, clipping, or unnatural stretching of the lace pattern?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white lace cravat in Image B is smoothly aligned with the neck area, displaying intricate lace patterns without noticeable distortion or stretching. It conforms to the typical positioning and detail seen in historical attire, suggesting accuracy and attention to detail. The analysis applies understanding of garment design and expectations of form.",
