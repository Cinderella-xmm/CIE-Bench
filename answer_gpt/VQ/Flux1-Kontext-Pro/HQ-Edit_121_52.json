    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's limbs appear proportionally consistent with typical human anatomy. The joints, such as the elbows and knees, are depicted with smooth curves. There are no zig-zag motion lines in the image, and the positioning of the limbs reflects natural movement as one might expect in an illustration or cartoon context. The limbs portray a dynamic pose with a raised fist and the opposite foot stepping forward in a believable manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture and shading of the celestial motifs on the spacesuit in Image B are depicted consistently, blending seamlessly with the material of the spacesuit. The illustrations maintain uniformity in their shading, respecting the contours and form of the suit. There are no visible seams or artifacts that disrupt the representation of the spacesuit material, contributing to a unified visual appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moon surface is illustrated to match the scale relative to the astronaut, supporting a believable interaction between the figure and the ground. The shadows and outlines are consistent with light sources depicted in the scene, contributing to a cohesive visual of depth and scale. There are no visible gaps or misalignments that would detract from the image composition.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since the face is blurred, an analysis of facial proportions and feature alignment cannot be accurately conducted. Excluding the blurred face, the rest of the image elements reflect due attention to anatomical correctness and proportionality. Thus, the question cannot be meaningfully applied due to the blurred details of the face.",

      "model_answer": "Not applicable",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the space-themed border is consistently aligned around the edges, framing the image neatly without infringing on the astronaut or background. The border maintains a steady proportion throughout, providing a clean separation between the central illustration and the edge. The card stock texture is uniformly applied, contributing to a cohesive appearance without detectable repetition or inconsistencies.",
