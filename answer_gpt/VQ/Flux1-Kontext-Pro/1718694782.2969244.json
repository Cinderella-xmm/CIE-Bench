      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the motion lines are designed to visually represent movement in art. Here, they need to follow the trajectory of the character's jump closely for a coherent depiction of motion. Observing these lines, they appear smooth and uniformly spaced, aligning with the character's direction of motion without jagged or inconsistent elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The internal monologue bubble should be placed in a manner that maintains the integrity of the character's features. In Panel 1 of Image B, the monologue bubble is clearly positioned above the character, keeping an appropriate distance without overlapping or distorting any part of the character’s body.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A smooth gradient should transition elegantly between colors without abrupt shifts or bands. In Panel 1, the sky exhibits a well-blended gradient moving softly from warm hues towards cooler shades, achieving a natural look without visible bands or breaks.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parachute should be shaped as expected in a parachute configuration, proportionally matching the character to ensure realism. Panel 2 of Image B presents a well-proportioned parachute with cords that logically extend from the character, showing a clear visual link from parachute to the character's point of contact.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Clouds in animation should be detailed with a sense of volume and soft edges for realism. In both panels of Image B, the clouds are depicted with depth, soft edges, and appropriately positioned such that they do not interfere or clip into the character or mountains, maintaining clarity and separation.",
