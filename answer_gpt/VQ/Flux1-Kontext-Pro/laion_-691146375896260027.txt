    "Question": "Q1: Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brown surface of the dresser appears smooth and consistent. There are no obvious visual gaps or irregularities in the texture that would suggest misalignment of individual LEGO bricks. The smoothness indicates that the assembler likely took care to align the bricks evenly. Based on this observation coupled with the assumed precision of LEGO construction, the dresser body appears well-constructed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
    "explanation": "The herringbone pattern on Image B's dresser front is clear and well-defined, with no apparent interruptions in the pattern. The alignment and continuity of the pattern suggest precise placement of LEGO pieces. Given the close resemblance to typical marquetry work, it indicates an adept assembly process that did not disrupt the flow of the lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gold decorative borders maintain a continuous flow without apparent breaks or sharp angles. The curved contours appear smooth, with the borders accurately aligned to follow the original Bauwlesque design. This suggests precise arrangement of decorative elements, which would be expected in a carefully crafted reproduction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
    "explanation": "The curved side panels and cabriole legs in Image B show a smooth profile with no visible steps or angular breaks, suggesting careful construction. The use of sloped bricks is apparent, as the sides and legs maintain an elegant curve, characteristic of French-style furniture design. This continuous curvature indicates skilled assembly to achieve these seamless transitions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the gray LEGO tile top appears to sit flat and level on the dresser. The edges where the top meets the sides appear clean, and there are no visible gaps suggesting that the placement is precise and well-aligned. This levelness and precision are consistent with properly seated LEGO tiles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
