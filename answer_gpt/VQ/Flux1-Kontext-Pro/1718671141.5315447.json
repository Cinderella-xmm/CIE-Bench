      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess the material appearance of brass gears and copper funnels, we observe the metallic components for texture quality and reflectivity. Brass and copper typically exhibit a shiny, polished appearance with smooth surface reflections. In Image B, these metallic details show consistent reflective characteristics and realistic surface textures, without pixelation or visual distortion, mirroring the qualities of real metallic surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Clock faces on a spherical surface should be proportionally adjusted to ensure alignment without distortion. In Image B, the clock faces are integrated seamlessly with the domeâ€™s curvature. The numerals and hands exhibit no warping, maintaining clear visibility and correct proportion, suggesting careful attention to the spherical alignment in the design.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Steam typically appears volumetric and has a gradual dispersion as it rises, while remaining translucent. The steam in Image B emanates naturally, showing a soft, volumetric cloud-like form with smooth edges. It rises in a plausible manner from the vents, without abrupt or clumsy clustering, aligning with natural steam behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In well-rendered 3D environments, ornamental details must be continuous, and properly scaled to fit the structure. Image B displays the ornamental metal details in a coherent fashion; they show well-defined edges, proper scaling around the dome, and lack gaps or jagged edges, indicating a complete and well-rendered design.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Reflections in water should be symmetrical and accurate representations of the object mirrored. In Image B, the reflection of the observatory maintains symmetry, mirroring all added steampunk elements like gears, clock faces, and steam vents accurately. The reflection is undistorted, preserving a true-to-life image of the edited structure.",
