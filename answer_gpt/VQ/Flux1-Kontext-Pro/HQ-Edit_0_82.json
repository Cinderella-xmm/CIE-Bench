      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are depicted as part of the background, aligned with the overall theme of a misty landscape.

      "question": "Are the date grids placed in a way that respects the spatial boundaries of the scene, such as being anchored to the ground or wall without overlapping the manâ€™s body or distorting his silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the date grids are located towards the top right corner of the image and are not overlapping with the man's body. They do not interfere with the main visual elements or distort his silhouette. Instead, they occupy a place that respects the scene's boundaries, ensuring clear visibility and separation from the primary subjects of the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man's hand is forming the 'OK' gesture, which is visually evident.
