      "question": "Does the cake’s icing display bold, graphic patterns that are evenly distributed and free from distorted textures or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake's icing exhibits bold and graphic patterns, using a pop-art style characterized by evenly distributed dots. This style omits detailed textures, relying instead on flat patterns to create a uniform design. Compared to Image A where the icing is textured and appears natural, Image B transforms it into bold and stylized patterns that are not distorted, suggesting a deliberate design choice typical of pop art.",

      "question": "Are the balloons represented as uniform monochrome dots that maintain their original spherical form and clustered grouping without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The balloons in Image B are represented with a pop-art style consisting of uniform monochrome dots that form a raster pattern. They remain spherical and clustered, keeping their rounded shapes without geometric distortion. Image A's balloons are naturally colored and textured, whereas Image B employs a consistent dot matrix pattern to maintain spherical integrity, adhering to the stylistic choice of pop art.",

      "question": "Have the table and vase been converted into solid, contrasting color blocks with sharp, clean edges and no residual textures or blending artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the table and vase as solid color blocks, using a bright pop-art color palette that contrasts sharply with the surrounding elements. Their edges are clean and defined, intentionally eschewing textures or blending artifacts common in more natural representations, such as Image A, where textures and details define these objects. Image B prioritizes bold solid colors typical in pop-art to create dramatic contrast and structure.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the candle flame feature exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues while remaining attached to the wick and showing an upward directional flow without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flame in Image B is depicted using sharp lines and bright hues, consistent with pop-art's exaggerated yet defined style. It remains attached to the wick, showing an upward directional flow, which is coherent with the usual depiction of flames. This contrasts with Image A, where the flame appears natural and dynamic but still flows upward and attaches to the candle as expected.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements positioned consistently within the scene’s depth and perspective, with no floating or misplaced components relative to the table and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized pop-art conversion, all elements (cake, candle, tabletop items, balloons) maintain correct and consistent positioning within the scene's perspective, avoiding any irregular floating or misplacement. The editing preserves relative depth and placement, ensuring the scene remains coherent. Image A also presents the scene with depth and perspective, confirming Image B's integrity in these aspects.",
