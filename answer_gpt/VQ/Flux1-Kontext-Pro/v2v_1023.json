      "question": "Do the chibi-style 3D characters retain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortions in their facial features and body shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style characters have been placed inside a snow globe. A chibi-style character typically maintains exaggerated proportions with a large head and small body, designed to look cute. The characters in the snow globe appear to maintain a proportionate appearance similar to their portrayal in Image A, with their facial features and body shapes looking consistent and appropriately scaled within the globe. There are no noticeable distortions that deviate from what would be expected in a chibi style. This suggests a careful editing process to retain a natural and consistent proportion typical of chibi characters.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe, including its base and the table it rests on, integrate naturally with the living room setting without visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is situated on a table within a living room setting. The integration of the globe, its base, and the table looks seamless; they appear to be a cohesive part of the environment. There's a consistent application of lighting and shadows that matches the ambient light in the room, ensuring the snow globe doesn't appear out of place or artificially added. The absence of obvious edges, overlap artifacts, or mismatched lighting suggests a well-executed integration.",

      "question": "Are the miniature snowflakes and twinkling fairy lights inside the snow globe visually credible and free from unnatural textures or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe appears to contain miniature snowflakes and fairy lights that contribute to the visual aesthetic. Upon examination, these elements are executed with appropriate attention to scale and texture. The snowflakes are small and dispersed realistically, while the fairy lights twinkle evenly across the interior of the globe, showing no unusual lighting patterns or textural aberrations. The consistency in lighting supports a credible image that fits within the snow globe aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the game controllers held by the chibi-style characters retain their original shape and texture, appearing natural and functional?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the game controllers held by the characters inside the snow globe have been retained with their original shape and structure. The attention to detail in the design ensures the controllers look like standard video game controllers. They maintain a consistent texture and size that are in line with what one would expect from real controllers. This careful preservation of appearance implies that the characters are actively playing, adding to the scene's authenticity within the context of a snow globe.",

      "question": "Does the sunlight streaming through the glass create believable sparkles on the tabletop, contributing to the warm, inviting ambiance without causing unnatural glare or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunlight interaction with the snow globe and tabletop is carefully applied to create a warm and inviting ambiance. The light interacts with the glass to produce natural reflections and sparkles that enhance the realistic portrayal of a sunlit room. There are no distracting glares or excessive shadows which could result from improper integration. The result is a believable depiction that effectively adds atmosphere to the composition without detracting from its natural feel.",
