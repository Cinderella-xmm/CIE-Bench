      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the key maintain its original geometric shape and proportions when transformed into a bridge, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no direct depiction of a key being transformed into a bridge. However, there is a carved, miniature castle inside a box with an arched stone structure resembling a bridge. Based on the question phrasing and visual cues, this seems to refer to a conceptual transformation rather than a literal depiction. Therefore, any transformation concept is visually coherent with the design of the structure which does not show warping or stretching. Without explicit reference to Observable B of a literal key transformation into a bridge, the distinction focuses on structural integrity which appears maintained in the physical representation of miniatures depicted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tiny houses and trees positioned in a way that aligns with the wood grain’s depth and surface plane, without floating or appearing disconnected from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tiny houses and trees within the miniature scene are placed in a manner suggesting integration with a sculpted terrain that is part of the wooden base inside the open box. Their positioning appears stable and adheres to a logic consistent with miniature diorama construction, where objects relate contextually to their base surface. They do not visually float or appear detached from the platform they inhabit, which implies a connection and alignment with surface lines present.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the resin river emerge smoothly from the key’s bit and flow with consistent material properties, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river, part of the miniature landscape, flows seamlessly through the diorama, consistent in coloration and form, resembling a stream carved into the setup. The question posits a hypothetical connection to a key element, but the photo depicts only an imaginative landscape as seen. The river does not appear with unnatural breaks or color changes, conveying a steady presence as typical of realistic model scenes.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boundary of the key case clearly defined and consistent with the wood grain and metallic tones of the key, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a wooden box open with a miniature garden scene inside. There is no visible 'key case' as directly cited. However, the question could intend assessment of how the box texture integrates with contained miniatures. The scene is well within its assigned space; wood grain looks coherent, rooted within its decorative purpose without texture or light disparity suggesting incongruence against actual miniature dioramas.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the carved wooden hill seamlessly blended into the surrounding wood grain, with consistent texture and shading that suggests natural carving rather than digital patching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases the wooden box setup wherein the 'hill' on which the miniatures stand seems to be crafted meticulously to align and fit its boxed setting. The transition from base to the sculptured 'hill' happens without noticeable abrupt edges or digital irregularities, projecting continuous materiality indicative of thoughtful carving not differing in grain or shading often found distinctive with wooden products.",
