    "Question": "Q2: Are the replaced cups depicted with clear, detailed sustainable material textures (such as fibrous or layered patterns) that appear natural and integrated into the scene without visible artifacts or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cups are replaced with those featuring textures typical of sustainable materials. These textures are well-detailed and aligned with the natural aesthetics of the scene, without any visible artifacts or blurring that would make them appear out of place.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the tag with the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the sceneâ€™s aesthetic, and seamlessly integrated with proper lighting and shadow alignment to avoid appearing pasted on?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tag attached to the box lid reads 'Zen Autumn Tea'. The text is clear and legible, and the tag fits stylistically with the overall aesthetic. It is well integrated with the scene, showing appropriate lighting effects and shadows, making it appear naturally part of the composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the teapot reshaped into a leaf contour with smooth, continuous edges and natural-looking earthy textures that do not show distortion, clipping, or unnatural color gradients?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot is edited to have a more artistic shape that might resemble natural forms but it retains its typical form rather than specifically being reshaped into a leaf. The textures are consistent and do not show distortion, though the specific reshaping described is not present.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do all edited elements (tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, leaf-shaped teapot) align with the original lighting direction and cast consistent shadows, maintaining spatial harmony and depth without floating or misaligned components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, all edited elements are cohesively integrated, following the original lighting direction and casting shadows consistently. The tea box lid, cups, tag, and teapot are harmoniously placed within the scene's spatial context, enhancing depth and maintaining alignment without appearing misaligned or floating.",
    "answer": "Yes"
