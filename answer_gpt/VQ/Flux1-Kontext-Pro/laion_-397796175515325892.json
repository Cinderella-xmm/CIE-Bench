      "question": "Are the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines smooth and continuous without jagged breaks or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, based on visual cues, the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines appear smooth and continuous. Using the knowledge that architectural outlines in photographs are typically clean unless there is distortion, we can conclude that the lines are not jagged or warped. These visual cues suggest the editing process maintained the integrity of the church's outlines.",

      "question": "Do the left and right halves of the church’s façade mirror each other exactly, causing any misalignment in window positions or wall contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Image B displays three side-by-side depictions of the church. Observing the center structure, both halves of the church façade appear symmetrical with aligned window positions and wall contours. This indicates careful editing to preserve the visual symmetry of the church’s facade.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic accent on the church's spire in Image B maintains a consistent appearance, as seen by its seamless transition without noticeable glow or clashing textures. This suggests that the editing respected the natural reflective quality of metallic accents.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a proportionally balanced spire aligned with the dimensions of the church’s body. Understanding typical architectural proportions, especially for churches, the edited image maintains a balanced appearance without extreme distortion, affirming the proportional relationship between the spire and church.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B showcases clear visibility of windows, arches, and roof details. By comparing architectural elements with general expectations for edited photographs, these details remain well-defined indicating the editing process preserved the church’s intricate features.",
