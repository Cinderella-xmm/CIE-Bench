    "Question": "Q1: Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO representation of the avocado half has a discernible smooth and curved appearance. The bricks used are aligned consistently along the edge, and visual cues show that the alignment avoids jagged or broken geometric shapes. This consistent smoothness is part of how LEGO bricks are arranged to depict such shapes accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the blueberries and raspberries are depicted using round LEGO bricks. These bricks maintain a spherical form that reflects the natural rounded appearance of the fruits without flattening or merging, which indicates a good representation using LEGO's typical round pieces.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO broccoli does maintain a layered, tree-like structure. The distinct florets are visible, preserving the vegetable's characteristic shape. It avoids a simplified or collapsed geometry, demonstrating a careful assembly to reflect the complex structure of broccoli.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows that the LEGO red bell pepper has been assembled to reflect a smoothly curved surface. The LEGO bricks are tightly fitted, without visible gaps or abrupt angles, consistent with a careful assembly to replicate the shape of a bell pepper smoothly.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
    "explanation": "The outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board in Image B closely mimics the original wooden board's contour. The form is consistent and follows the contours well, with no breaks or irregularities evident from the visual cues.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the asparagus stalks appear aligned in parallel, mimicking the natural arrangement they have when bundled. There is also an indication of a LEGO representation of twine, maintaining the bundle's original structure and proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
    "explanation": "Image B presents the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base. The lighting appears consistent, with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that could imply mismatched lighting or depth, signaling a well-composed setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
