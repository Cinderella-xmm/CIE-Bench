      "question": "Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bell jar encases the robot, serving as a protector or display case. Upon examining the jar, the surfaces appear clear and smooth, allowing for undisturbed visibility of the robot inside. The reflections and refractions caused by the glass seem natural, as the robot maintains its structure without distortion. These visual cues indicate craftsmanship typical in display cases intended to present objects without altering their perception.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pedestal under the robot properly aligned, proportionally sized, and made of materials consistent with the steampunk theme (e.g., brass, copper) without visible seams or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pedestal on which the robot stands is structurally aligned and proportioned to accommodate the robot's weight and dimensions adequately. This base is crafted from materials like brass or copper, which align with the steampunk aesthetic characterized by industrial and Victorian-era design elements. There are no visible seams or deformities, suggesting consistent construction quality and coherence with the theme.",

      "question": "Are the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils positioned at a plausible scale and orientation around the robot, with natural textures and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils accompanying the robot. These elements are appropriately scaled and strategically placed, contributing to the visual narrative without causing imbalance or impracticality in the composition. Their textures are consistent with miniature models, adhering to realism, and there are no anomalies like floating parts, which enhances the plausibility within the scene.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In examining Image B, the glowing orbs attached to the robot emit a gentle and localized light, harmonizing seamlessly with the overall ambient lighting of the scene. The luminosity appears well-balanced, avoiding any overexposure or harsh light artifacts that would disrupt the visual consistency of the image. Such integration is crucial for maintaining a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing visual presentation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background displays a rusted metal appearance, providing an industrial backdrop. This texture and coloration complement the robot's materials, which embody a similar palette characteristic of aged metal finishes. The transition between these elements does not reveal any jarring edges or tonal shifts, thus achieving a harmonious blend that supports the thematic coherence between subject and setting.",
