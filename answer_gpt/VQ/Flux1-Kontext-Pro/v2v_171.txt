    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi Funko Pop-style figure maintain the structural coherence of the child's facial features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi Funko Pop-style figure depicts a stylized version of the child, which means it's expected to have characteristic exaggerations, such as a larger head and simplified features. This is typical of Funko Pop designs, where accuracy is not the main goal, but rather to achieve a distinctive look. Therefore, within the expectations of this style, the figure retains coherence without introducing distortions that are unusual for such figures.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the tech-related accessories added to the chibi figure free of unnatural textures and integrated smoothly with the figure's design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tech accessory, which is the tablet, is presented as simplistic yet coherent with the rest of the model. It doesn't display any out-of-place textures that clash with the figure's design. Given the stylization typical of Funko Pop figures, the tablet appears naturally integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the casual attire of the chibi figure retain its realistic texture and detail, avoiding any loss of fine details?",
    "explanation": "The attire on the chibi figure in Image B is simplified to match the stylized nature of such figurines. However, the color, form, and appropriate fold lines convey clothing in a coherent manner. Despite the simplification, no details feel overly lost given the style constraints.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the cross-legged sitting pose of the chibi figure with the tablet anatomically plausible and free of any unnatural deformations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi figure's cross-legged pose is consistent with what is possible within the boundary of a Funko Pop style. These figures typically have a limited and stylized range of movement, and this representation fits within that range. There are no noticeable deformations that break anatomical expectations within this context.",
    "answer": "Yes"
