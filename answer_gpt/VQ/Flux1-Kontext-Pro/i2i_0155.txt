    "Question": "Q1: Does the addition of 'Breathe' at the top left corner blend naturally with the image without introducing any visible artifacts or disrupting the plant's structural appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, 'Breathe' is positioned at the top left corner of the image over the background right above the plant. The text integration is visually coherent with no visible distortion to the plant or introduction of artifacts; therefore, the plant's structural appearance remains intact.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q2: Is the inclusion of 'Calm' at the bottom right corner naturally integrated into the scene, ensuring that the window frame's geometry remains intact and visually plausible?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows the text 'Calm' placed at the bottom left corner, overlapping the plant but not the window frame. Analyzing this, the geometry of the window frame remains unchanged and visually plausible, indicating the text is integrated naturally.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the light reflections and shadows on the leaves natural and consistent with the lighting source, unaffected by the added text 'Breathe' and 'Calm'?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text overlay does not intrude upon the actual plant and its reactions to the light are consistent with the natural lighting source seen through the window. The light reflections and shadows on the leaves appear untouched and remain natural and consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the texture details of the terracotta pot and its saucer remain authentic and detailed, with no degradation or introduction of unnatural textures due to the addition of text?",
    "explanation": "The text 'Breathe' and 'Calm' in Image B does not interfere with the terracotta pot and saucer in terms of space and detail, keeping them authentic and detailed. There is no introduction of unnatural textures or degradation visible on the pot or saucer.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Has the positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' preserved the plant's form and the window's symmetry, avoiding any distortion or disruption in proportions?",
    "explanation": "The positioning of 'Breathe' and 'Calm' in Image B adheres to the overall proportions and symmetry of the scene. The plant's form and the window's symmetry are intact, with no visible distortions or disruptions introduced by the text placement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
