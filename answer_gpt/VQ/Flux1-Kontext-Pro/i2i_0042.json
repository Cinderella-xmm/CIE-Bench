      "question": "Are the person's arms and hands in a raised position that looks natural and consistent with their chibi-style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arms and hands are portrayed with a characteristic chibi-style exaggeration, where features are often rounded, and proportions are smaller. The arms are slightly outstretched, consistent with the playful, expressive style typical of chibi figures. This position looks natural within the context of a chibi transformation, prioritizing the portrayal of an outgoing and inviting gesture typical to such designs.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the added text \"Level 6 Â· Mega Meal\" blend well with the background and does not introduce distracting artifacts or look unnaturally placed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B sits prominently at the top, placed against a relatively simple background characterized by a clear and bold presentation. This format mirrors the style used in packaging or standee designs for collectibles, and the text style, size, and placement all contribute to a cohesive appearance without clashing with or distracting from other visual elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the burgers and fries on the table retain their realistic texture, detail, and shape, appearing as if they were untouched by the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The food items in Image B maintain a visible degree of realistic details such as colors, textures, and general arrangement. They appear to be realistically preserved, without conversion into chibi style, which often affects human features and proportion rather than non-human elements like food. This suggests that the transformation focused on the person rather than the surrounding items.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the person been transformed into a chibi-style figure that maintains recognizable facial and body features without unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person is transformed following the chibi artistic style, characterized by exaggerated and simplified features such as a larger head and a smaller body. The transformation maintains recognizable proportions typical of the chibi style, and the textures and details seen are consistent with those common to such artistic renderings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall scene remain visually plausible, with the person now as a chibi-style collectible presented in a trendy acrylic standee character sheet format without any distorted elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the scene with a transformation that places the person into an acrylic standee format, resembling collectible packaging. This visual structure is well-aligned with the details typical to such collectibles, including the character fully enclosed within a defined space and the additional text providing context. The transformation and format appear coherent and deliberate without introducing unnatural distortions.",
