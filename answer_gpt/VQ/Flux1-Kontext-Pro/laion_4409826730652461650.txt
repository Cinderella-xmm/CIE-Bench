    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's eyes and mouth are stylized to fit a cartoon theme. The eyes are larger and more expressive than the ones in Image A, and the mouth appears more simplistic. These differences indicate a deliberate shift to cartoon aesthetics, adding charm and character. While the design does change, it maintains similar proportions relative to the face and head structure, respecting the original plush's placement, albeit in a stylized manner.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fur and plastic base are simplified due to the cartoon style, but intentionally so to align with the thematic image transformation.

The proportional changes serve to emphasize character and expression rather than mechanical accuracy, yet they are recognizable and maintain visual linkage to their original configuration.",
