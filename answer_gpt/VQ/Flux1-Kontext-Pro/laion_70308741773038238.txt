    "Question": "Q2: Are the glass bases at the wheel positions transparent with visible internal texture, evenly shaped, and grounded flush with the platform without floating or clipping issues?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the glass bases where wheels would typically be are transparent, allowing a clear view of the internal texture, which adds a decorative element to the base. They appear evenly shaped and are adequately grounded with the platform, indicating a stable and secure appearance without any floating or clipping inconsistencies.",

    "Question": "Q3: Is the silver cap centered on the roof area, with clean edges and reflective surface that matches the surrounding chrome elements?",
    "explanation": "The silver cap on the roof area in Image B is centrally positioned, maintaining symmetry in the design. It has clean edges and its surface reflects light in a manner that aligns aesthetically with other chrome elements on the body. This demonstrates a coherent integration of design elements characteristic of metallic finishes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the embossed text along the side panel clearly legible, aligned with the body's curvature, and rendered with subtle depth and shadow to match the material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text along the side panel is not visibly clear. It lacks legibility and does not demonstrate obvious integration with the bodyâ€™s curvature or material rendering. Unlike a typical automotive finish where text would be visible and incorporate natural depth and shadowing, this area appears plain.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the wave patterns flow continuously across the surface without repeating tiles, jagged edges, or mismatched lighting effects?",
    "explanation": "The wave patterns on the surface of the body in Image B show a continuous flow, enhancing the dynamic feel of the design. There are no obvious tile repeats, jagged edges, or mismatched lighting effects that would disrupt the visual integrity of the patterns, supporting a seamless aesthetic harmony with the overall design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
