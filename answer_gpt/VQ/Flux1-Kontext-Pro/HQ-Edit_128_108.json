      "question": "Does the transformed lantern maintain its original symmetrical shape and geometric proportions without visible distortion or broken lattice patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern remains symmetrical and maintains its geometric proportions. The intricate patterns are clearly visible and consistent with no signs of distortion. This observation is based on the visual cues of the lantern's design details matched with common symmetry in lantern structures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the metallic embossed flame logo on the lantern's surface consistent with the surrounding material, showing realistic depth and reflections without unnatural edges or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lantern shows consistent material characteristics, with realistic depth and reflections that integrate well without unnatural edges or mismatches. The visual consistency in metallic surfaces is used to assess this aspect based on knowledge of typical metallic rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the marketplace elements converted into side textures of the packaging clearly recognizable as derived from the original scene but stylized appropriately, without distortion or loss of fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B lacks direct marketplace elements derived from the original scene of Image A, and instead focuses more on detailed patterns and ornate design features representative of Moroccan styles. Hence, marketplace elements are not visibly converted or recognizable in terms of stylization in the second image.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the deep gold and amber tones applied to the packaging blend naturally with the existing lighting and material colors, avoiding harsh transitions or unnatural glow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a harmonious integration of deep gold and amber tones with the packaging, maintaining a natural blend with the ambient colors around the candle without harsh transitions. This observation is drawn from the visual symmetry and color blending aspects in decorative packaging design.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the scented candle silhouette positioned correctly on the packaging front, maintaining proper scale and alignment with the surrounding design elements without visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scented candle is centrally positioned within the packaging, showing correct alignment with surrounding design elements. This maintains a coherent presentation based on visual assessment from design symmetry and ergonomic positioning principles.",
