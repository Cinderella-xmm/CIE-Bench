    "Question": "Q1: Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armorâ€™s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tesserae on the chest and torso are arranged in a manner that follows the contours and curves of the armor. The tiles are uniformly sized and placed, maintaining a consistent pattern that mirrors the structural design of the armor. There are no visible breaks or misalignments present, indicating a well-executed mosaic arrangement. This observation leads to the conclusion that the tesserae are flawlessly integrated into the armor's design.",
