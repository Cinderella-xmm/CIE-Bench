      "question": "Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone screen depicts holographic widgets and 3D elements that appear to be floating above the screen, which suggests a futuristic interface technology. Normally, for these elements to appear seamlessly integrated, there should be consistent shadowing and depth cues that match the surface and dimensions of the smartphone. While the visual style might be advanced, the holographic rendering should not disrupt the perception that they are part of the phone. The image shows that these depth cues and shadowing are visually coherent and maintain the phone's form factor.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the forward-projection effect on the smartphone screen appears to maintain the integrity of the phone's frame and screen edges. The holographic design does not seem to introduce any distortion to the physical aspects of the phone. The spatial relationship between the holographic interface and the hand holding the phone is consistent, with the hand interacting naturally with the interface, which suggests a proper alignment without visual discrepancies.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the biometric overlay on the screen does not appear as a traditional biometric scanner. Though holographic technology is depicted, it is mostly displayed as futuristic interface elements rather than a detailed biometric scan of the hand. Moreover, there seems to be no inclusion of extra fingers or distortion to the natural anatomy in its depiction. Thus, the representation aligns with the hand's actual anatomy without any visual inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laptop screen portrays a futuristic skyline, which is rendered with a consistent blue-hued interface that is in line with the rest of the image's aesthetic. The perspective and geometry of the skyline are consistent, and there is no noticeable clipping or misalignment with the laptop's physical bezel and keyboard. This suggests that the digital content is properly aligned with the physical constraints of the laptop screen.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the smartphone and laptop displays exhibit a unified design language, characterized by a blue color palette and futuristic interface elements. The typography and holographic interface styling are consistent across both devices, contributing to a coherent and cohesive technological narrative without introducing conflicting styles. This creates an immersive and integrated depiction of future technology.",
