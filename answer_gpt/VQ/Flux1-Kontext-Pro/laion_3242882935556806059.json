    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes preserved with jagged crystal facets that follow the natural curvature of the original lily petals, without visible warping or geometric breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals are composed of crystal-like facets. These facets are intricately arranged to mimic the natural curvature found in real flower petals, similar to those in Image A, which are lily petals with smooth, continuous surfaces. The facets align well with the expected shapes, maintaining the floral structure without noticeable distortions. This suggests a high-quality editing process that successfully maintains the integrity of the original petal shapes, albeit in a different material.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glass rods extend naturally from the vase upward, matching the number and spacing of the original stems, without appearing disconnected or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows glass rods that extend from the vase's base upward. When examining the spacing and alignment, they match well with the stems in Image A, which are naturally grouped and straight. The editing process preserved the quantity and spatial arrangement accurately, maintaining the continuity and natural appearance as expected.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the black marble surface beneath the vase smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective, with shadows and highlights consistent with the light source and object placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a black marble surface with visible white veins typical of marble. The surface reflects light consistently, showing cohesion with the vase and flower reflections. The shadows and highlights adhere to logical light placement, matching the reflective property of marble and consistent lighting angles, indicating a realistic and high-quality editing process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the crystal petals exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency, with internal light refractions and depth cues that suggest volume and translucency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the petals have an amber-like crystal appearance. This includes varying shades, transparency, and the presence of internal reflections and refractions that mimic natural light interactions within gemstones. This suggests volume and translucency, demonstrating a sophisticated editing technique that provides an engaging visual depth.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the glass rods enter the water at angles consistent with refraction, showing slight bending at the waterline, and remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B reveals glass rods entering the water in a vase. Physics of refraction causes slight bending when objects enter or exit water, visible in the rods' interactions at the water surface. The rods remain consistently submerged, emphasizing continuity without visual breakage or misalignment with the water's refractive properties, representing accurate physical rendering.",
