      "question": "Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings are made of what appears to be structured feathers rather than crystal shards. These feathers are symmetrically aligned on each side of the character, following a natural arc that is common in artistic depictions of angelic wings. The feathers do not seem to have any visible gaps or distorted geometry, and they are properly attached to the shoulders. Based on this visual information, the alignment and structure are coherent and without noticeable flaws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the golden leafy strands follow the natural flow of the original hair and appear integrated without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no golden leafy strands present. The hair appears to be natural, with soft wave patterns that are consistent with natural hair. Given that there are no added strands or elements, integration or disconnection is not applicable, so the character's hairstyle seems to flow naturally and without additional adornments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the shirt display a uniform, soft velvet texture with natural shadowing and no repeating patterns or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shirt is a plain and smooth fabric, most likely cotton or a similar material, rather than velvet. It has a clean appearance with natural creases and shadows, which helps it look realistic and integrated with the character's pose. No digital artifacts or repeating patterns are visible, ensuring a seamless appearance of the shirt.",

      "question": "Is the background a consistent deep gray wall with no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or remnants of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears to be a uniform, deep gray wall. It provides a neutral backdrop that highlights the character and ensures no distractions. The lighting is consistent across the background, with no anomalies or visible edges that would suggest remnants of another scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements—crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt—properly aligned with the body and each other, without clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts angelic wings rather than crystal wings, natural hair without additional adornments, and a plain shirt rather than velvet. All these elements appear well-integrated with the character's posture, without any clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion. Each element seems to align perfectly with the body, ensuring a coherent presentation.",
