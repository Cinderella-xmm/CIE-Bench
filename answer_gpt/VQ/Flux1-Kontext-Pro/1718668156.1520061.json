      "question": "Does the tall glass on the right display consistent pixelated and circuit-like textures across its surface without visible cracks, jagged edges, or inconsistent rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tall glass is stylized with a digital neon aesthetic, characterized by consistent pixelated and circuit-like textures. The glass maintains a coherent and uniform design without visible inconsistencies, such as cracks or jagged edges. This effect is intentional to match the overall digital or holographic theme present in the image.",

      "question": "Are the outlines of the Sydney Opera House composed of continuous, evenly spaced neon lines that maintain the correct number and shape of the shell structures without misalignment or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Sydney Opera House is outlined with neon lines that create a clean and consistent look. These lines are intentionally even and continuous, capturing the iconic shape and number of shells of the Opera House. The neon lines are carefully rendered to avoid misalignment or missing segments, aligning with the artistic style of the edited image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns in the water consist of uniform, repeating geometric shapes that align horizontally and vertically without overlapping irregularly or creating gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water in Image B features wave patterns composed of geometric shapes that fit well with the overall digital theme. These patterns repeat uniformly and are organized in a grid-like manner, aligning both horizontally and vertically. The design avoids irregular overlaps or gaps, maintaining a consistent visual language throughout the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the beverage in the shorter glass show a consistent holographic effect with subtle layering and refraction, without distorting the shape of the ice cubes or causing unnatural transparency gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shorter glass in Image B displays a holographic effect, consistent with the digital theme. The layering and refraction effects are subtly integrated, preserving the realistic shapes of the ice cubes within the beverage. There are no apparent distortions or unnatural transparency issues that affect the appearance of the ice cubes, indicating a high-quality rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the two glasses aligned with the direction of the sunset lighting, and do they match the apparent position of the sun in the sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B has a digital night theme with neon lighting effects, which overrides the real-world expectations of sunset lighting and traditional shadow casting. The digital theme doesn't integrate traditional sunlight or source lighting and consequently doesn't model realistic shadows relative to a sun position. Instead, the neon lighting effects are more for artistic purposes and aren't expected to cast shadows in the same way as natural lighting.",
