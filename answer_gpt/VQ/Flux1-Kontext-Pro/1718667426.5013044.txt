    "Question": "Q2: Is the surface of the ogre’s body and clothing uniformly matte with no shiny reflections or residual skin texture?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts the ogre with a matte finish across both the skin and clothing. There's a uniform lack of shine, indicative of a material like plastic or painted surfaces typical in collectible figurines. This matte surface is consistent with the appearance of manufactured toys, which generally avoid glossy textures unless intentionally highlighted.",
