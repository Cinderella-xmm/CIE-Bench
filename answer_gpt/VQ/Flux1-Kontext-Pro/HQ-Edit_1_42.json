    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the cartoon version of the man have correctly proportioned limbs, five fingers per hand, and natural joint angles without bending or elongation errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon version of the man appears to have limbs that are simplified in style but correctly proportioned for a caricature. The hands, while possibly stylized, show a reasonable finger count and articulation typical of either four or five-finger cartoon hands, often simplified in cartoons. The joint angles are consistent with sitting poses seen in cartoonish renderings; they lack realistic detail but do not exhibit unnatural elongation or anatomical errors for this style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the swirling leaves positioned in a way that follows logical airflow paths and do not intersect or pass through the man’s body or bench?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image shows the leaves positioned around the man, some appearing on the bench and ground, giving a sense of natural deposition rather than mid-air suspension, which maintains a logical appearance without intersecting tangibly through the man’s body or bench.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the tree canopies and foliage display consistent color distribution and intact branching structures without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree canopies maintain a vibrant color palette consistent with autumn hues, seamlessly blending red, orange, and yellow tones. The foliage is visually integrated without visible breaks or misalignments, maintaining consistent branching structures that align with artistic representations of trees.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the cream-colored paper background uniformly textured and do the tree branch motifs lie flat without distortion, clipping, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B appears as a smooth, cream-colored texture, characteristic of paper. The tree branch motifs are printed flatly, with no visible distortion, clipping, or shadows that would indicate irregularities, maintaining the consistency expected in printed visuals.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the elements (man, leaves, bench, paper border) arranged within clear margins and aligned symmetrically or logically to suggest a bounded page layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a structured composition where each element fits within clear boundaries. The man and bench are centrally aligned, with margins visible around the edges, suggesting careful alignment typical in content meant to fit within page boundaries.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all surfaces (clothing, skin, leaves, paper) rendered with consistent sharpness and texture detail without jagged lines, smudging, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the rendering of surfaces like clothing, leaves, and paper maintains consistent sharpness and texture. The artwork employs smooth lines typical of print art, avoiding jagged edges, unnecessary smudging, or extreme smoothing, preserving detail appropriate for this style.",
