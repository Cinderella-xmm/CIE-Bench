      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the woman’s body posture while leaning against the hut appear physically plausible, with correct alignment of limbs and no unnatural bending or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image presents a woman leaning against a hut with her body posture appearing natural. The alignment of her arms, the position of her feet, and the way her clothing drapes all suggest a realistic posture. The visual cues and common knowledge about how bodies naturally rest against surfaces indicate physical plausibility.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the abstracted beaded jewelry elements rendered with smooth transitions and consistent geometric patterns, without visible artifacts such as blurring or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beaded jewelry, described with vivid geometric patterns, shows smooth transitions in color and shape in the edited image. This level of detailed rendering suggests there are no artifacts like blurring or distortion, which would disrupt the continuity of the patterns.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silhouette of the woman cleanly separated from the background with no jagged edges, ghosting, or misaligned contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the silhouette of the woman in the third postcard is distinctly separated from the background. The edges appear smooth and well-defined, without any signs of ghosting or jagged misalignments, suggesting a cleanly executed silhouette.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric borders applied consistently around each postcard without overlapping or distorting the main subject or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image displays geometric borders that are consistently applied around each postcard. There do not appear to be any overlaps or distortions of the subjects or backgrounds within these frames. This consistent application helps maintain the integrity and focus of the main visual elements.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman’s traditional clothing in the edited image maintains its pattern continuity and texture across all three versions portrayed. There are no abrupt highlights or material shifts that would suggest distortion, maintaining visual and thematic consistency throughout.",
