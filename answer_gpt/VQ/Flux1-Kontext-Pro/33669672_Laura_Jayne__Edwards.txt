    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the figure appear smooth and proportionally elongated, demonstrating a natural flow without any visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments. This judgment is based on the alignment and form of the limbs, suggesting that they maintain a consistent proportion typically found in statues or sculptures designed to emphasize elegance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
    "explanation": "The boots and leg areas in Image B exhibit a clean design, void of overlapping or fragmented sections. The patterns appear uniformly applied on the boots, corresponding to the smooth and clean texture of a metallic finish, which typically does not involve intricate geometric patterns unlike Image A, where added elements like flowers may cause complexity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure shows a consistent metallic sheen throughout the body, including the skin, dress, and boots. The surface reflects light evenly, suggesting a smooth gradient with no mismatched material. This consistency is typical in metallic statues or sculptures that are coated uniformly to maintain aesthetic appeal.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
    "explanation": "The color palette in Image B is confined to metallic tones and turquoise for the background, maintaining uniformity without any unexpected color bleed or desaturation. This controlled palette provides an emphasis on the metallic surface finish typically used to portray sophistication and beauty in sculptures against minimalist settings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's pose displays a natural weight distribution, with limbs positioned in a manner that portrays balance and grace typically associated with sculptural art. There are no indications of floating limbs or unnatural overlaps, as the pose mirrors a dynamic yet stable form aligned with classic artistic representations.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
    "explanation": "The extended hand in Image B possesses exactly five fingers with a natural spacing and curvature. The detail matches expectations for a well-crafted representation of human anatomy, where the articulation of joint movement reflects lifelike modeling compared to abstract or flawed depictions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
