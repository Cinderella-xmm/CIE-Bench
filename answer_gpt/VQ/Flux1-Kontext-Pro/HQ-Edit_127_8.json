    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the stone towers, archway, and knight proportionally scaled and positioned correctly within the glass orb without geometric distortion or unnatural perspective shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the stone towers, archway, and knight appear to be appropriately scaled and positioned within the glass orb. The proportions do not suggest any distortion or perspective anomalies when viewed as a cohesive scene. The positioning of elements like the towers and knight within the orb seems consistent and natural, suggesting intentional design without distortion.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the stone textures on the towers and gate retain fine detail and natural variation after being minified, without appearing overly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stone textures on the towers and gate exhibit detailed and varied surface characteristics despite their reduced size. The features maintain detail and avoid a pixelated appearance or excessive smoothing, providing a realistic texture consistent with natural stone.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the antique bronze finish applied uniformly to the knightâ€™s armor and the gate, with realistic tarnish, reflections, and surface depth that match physical metal properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knight's armor and gate in Image B show a consistent antique bronze finish. There are realistic effects of tarnish and reflections, and the surface depth mimics physical metal properties convincingly, lending the image a lifelike metallic sheen and texture.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the heraldic flags positioned correctly on the battlements, with natural folds and orientation suggesting movement in wind, and no clipping or floating artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On examining Image B, the flags atop the battlements are positioned realistically, with folds and movement indicating the presence of wind. There are no signs of any clipping, floating artifacts, or unnatural placement, contributing to the scene's dynamic realism.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tiny turrets and crenellated walls around the base of the orb evenly spaced, geometrically accurate, and stylistically consistent with the main castle structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B illustrates the turrets and crenellated walls around the orb's base, which are evenly spaced, geometrically harmonious, and stylistically cohesive with the main structure. This consistency aligns with architectural norms seen in castle designs.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the golden rays integrated into the glass surface with proper refraction and depth, creating a seamless illusion of light emanating from within the orb without visible layering or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden rays in Image B are adeptly integrated into the glass surface, producing a seamless illusion indicative of light's natural emanation and refraction. The depth effect and absence of edge artifacts or layering issues contribute to an aesthetically coherent and realistic visual impact.",
