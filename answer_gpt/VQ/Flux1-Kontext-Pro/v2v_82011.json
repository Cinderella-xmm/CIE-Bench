      "question": "Do the bold calligraphic outlines and flat planes of color on the dolls' clothing and hair maintain the original proportions and positions without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls are rendered with bold outlines and flat colors typical of the Ukiyo-e style. The proportions and positions of the clothing and hair appear consistent with the usual structure expected in such artworks, using stylization typical of that genre. This style naturally abstracts and alters proportions slightly for artistic effect but remains coherent with the design principles. Therefore, the transformation does not introduce unnatural distortions beyond those expected for this art style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the dolls' skin and hair free from unnatural artifacts and maintain a natural appearance after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Ukiyo-e art, textures are often simplified to broad areas of color, which is evident in Image B. The dolls’ skin and hair are depicted with flat shades without the detailed texture found in realistic or photographic styles. This simplification creates a different but stylized kind of natural appearance consistent with the art style. This transformation avoids unnatural artifacts by adhering closely to Ukiyo-e conventions.",

      "question": "Do the dolls' limbs and facial features retain their structural integrity and do not appear deformed after the style transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dolls’ limbs and facial features are depicted using the Ukiyo-e style, which simplifies and stylizes subjects. While the features are abstracted, they maintain a recognizable form that does not feel structurally compromised. The consistency with how form is handled in this artistic style ensures that there is no apparent deformation beyond the intended artistic abstraction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the subtly patterned, simplified background complement the dolls without disrupting the visual flow and maintaining the overall sense of reality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B uses soft colors and simple patterns typical of Ukiyo-e art. It serves as a complementary backdrop, enhancing the figures without distracting from the central subjects. This use of background aligns with traditional techniques in Ukiyo-e, maintaining visual balance and thematic coherence without disrupting the scene's reality within the bounds of artistic expression.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the dolls' poses and expressions remain coherent with the original scene and contribute to the visual credibility of the Ukiyo-e style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The poses and relative arrangement observed in Image B are consistent with dynamic yet static depictions characteristic of Ukiyo-e art. The dolls’ positioning replicates the intent and emotion of the original scene, transformed into the stylistic framework without losing interpretive coherence. Thus, the visual transformation maintains the intended narrative and emotional effect consistent with the Ukiyo-e style.",
