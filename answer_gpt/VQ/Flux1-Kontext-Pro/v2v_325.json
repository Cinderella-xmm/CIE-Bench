        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "First, by examining Image B, we can see that the chibi car mascots maintain their original vibrant colors such as red, yellow, green, and blue, matching the cars seen in the original truck setup. The shapes of the cars, including key features like contours and designs, are preserved from their normal-sized counterparts, as seen in Image A. This demonstrates that there has been no noticeable distortion or loss of detail in transferring this design. Therefore, the answer is supported by examining both images and confirming consistency in shape and color.",
