      "question": "Does the keychain version of the character maintain the same proportions and colors as the original image, without any visible distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain character appears to have the same proportions and colors as a typical depiction of the character, such as in Image A. The character retains the same yellow body, webbed feet, large bill, and black eyes. There is no distortion or unnatural texture in the representation of the keychain that deviates from depicting the original character accurately. Comparing it with Image A, it is evident that the keychain maintains consistent visual details akin to a traditional representation.",

      "question": "Does the keychain appear naturally placed on the desk with appropriate shadows and reflections, indicating a realistic interaction with the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the keychain character is placed on a desk, and there are visible shadows that suggest a light source, further enhancing the three-dimensionality of the setting. The shadows appear to be consistent with the lighting and add to the realism of the character's placement on the desk. The presence of a shadow under the keychain gives it a sense of weight and grounding, as would be expected for an object resting on a surface.",

      "question": "Are the books and glasses placed next to the keychain rendered with realistic textures and a consistent level of detail, without any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows books and glasses next to the keychain. The books have visible covers and pages that retain a natural and realistic appearance, including appropriate texture details. The glasses appear to be well-rendered with expected reflective surfaces. There are no obvious artifacts or inconsistencies that detract from the realism of these objects in the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the edges of the keychain and its neighboring objects (books, glasses, desk) crisp and well-defined, with no signs of blending or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outline and edges of the keychain, books, and glasses are sharp and clearly defined, showing no signs of blending or breaking apart. The boundaries between different elements in the image are distinct, ensuring clarity and differentiation between objects. This crispness in edges suggests a high-quality rendering of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the books and glasses exhibit proper orientation and placement on the desk, reflecting typical real-world scenarios where they would be found?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The books are stacked and the glasses rest naturally on the desk in Image B, displaying a common layout found in real-life scenarios. This arrangement enhances the believability of the scene, as it mimics typical behavior and placement in a real-world setting. The orientation and position are coherent, reflecting everyday use and placement of such items.",
