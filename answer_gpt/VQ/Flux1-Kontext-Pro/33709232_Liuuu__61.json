      "question": "Does the transformed building retain consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions, with no visible warping or broken edges in its armored body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been transformed into a giant robot. The analysis involves checking the geometric proportions of this robot's armor. The robot has consistent edges and smooth surface transitions without any visible warping or broken edges. The joints and connections between parts are coherent, indicating a well-crafted transformation that retains proportional integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stylized shoulder pads seamlessly integrated into the roofline, with clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robot in Image B has stylized shoulder pads, which are part of its design. These shoulder pads are well-defined with clean, sharp edges and coherent designs. They do not show any signs of being stretched or fragmented, suggesting they are seamlessly integrated into the robotâ€™s structure.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the replaced traffic signs display clear holographic effects (e.g., soft glow, transparency) without causing light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the environment includes elements like robotic pedestrians and a transformed building, the traffic signs do not show holographic effects. The signs appear standard and do not showcase features like soft glow or transparency. Thus, there are no light leaks or unnatural color shifts caused by holographic effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the robotic pedestrians have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, and do their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robotic pedestrians in Image B are examined for anatomical correctness in proportion and design. They have correctly proportioned limbs and display a logical shape for joints and overall body structure. Each hand is equipped with five fingers, and the joints do not show any unnatural bending or missing segments, reflecting proper robotic engineering.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building consistent with the direction of sunlight from the top-left, and do they align naturally with surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the shadows in Image B, the sunlight is coming from the top-left of the scene. The shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building are consistent with this light direction. The shadows align naturally with the street and buildings, adhering to the expected physics of light and shadow interaction in the environment.",
