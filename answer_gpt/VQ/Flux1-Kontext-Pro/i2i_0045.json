      "question": "Are the girl, stone platform, and frisbee free of unnatural distortions or artifacts, appearing structurally coherent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the visual elements included are a bus and a stone platform with a 'do not enter' sign. There is no presence of a girl, meaning that an analysis of artifacts or structural coherence regarding a girl cannot be performed. The visual inspection shows no apparent artifacts on the bus or platform with the visible elements in place. Thus, the question seems to be mismatched with the content of Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the grass and blue sky background integrate smoothly with the foreground elements, avoiding obvious seams or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background includes a field with grass and a blue sky with clouds, supporting typical outdoor lighting conditions. The bus and stone platform sit naturally in this setting without noticeable edges or unnatural texture differences, suggesting a seamless integration. Therefore, the transition between foreground and background visually is cohesive.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the girl, stone platform, and frisbee adhere to the golden ratio principles in their positioning, creating a balanced and visually credible composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a girl or a frisbee, only a bus and a stone platform with a sign, which alters the context. Considering the available objects, the arrangement is functional but not necessarily aligned with the golden ratio as this specific architectural principle isn't visually evident given the available components.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the fine details like the texture of the girl's clothing, the surface of the stone platform, and the frisbee preserved clearly without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the analysis is limited to the details present, which include the bus and stone platform. The textures on the bus paneling and the stone platform are clearly rendered without apparent degradation. The mention of the girl's clothing and frisbee doesn't apply as these elements are non-existent in the visual analysis of Image B.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the lighting on the girl, stone platform, and frisbee match the lighting conditions of the new grass and sky background, avoiding mismatched shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Since Image B lacks the presence of a girl and a frisbee, the analysis focuses on the bus and stone platform. The lighting across these elements appears consistent with the outdoor setting of a grassy field and clear sky, as there are no mismatched shadows or highlights visible on the bus or stone platform.",
