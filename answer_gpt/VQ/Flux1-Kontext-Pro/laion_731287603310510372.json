    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders sharp and unaltered by the added shadowy textures or angular lines, with no visible distortion or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders appear sharp and well-defined. The added shadowy textures and angular lines do not seem to have distorted these edges, as they remain distinct with no visible ghosting or blurring around them. The sepia effect overlays the entire image but does not particularly affect the sharpness of the edges. Thus, the image maintains clear boundaries and contours around these areas.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the title \"The Gray Mystery\" positioned outside the man’s face and cap area, and does it not partially cover or obscure any facial features or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the title 'The Gray Mystery' is clearly positioned below the man’s head and does not intrude upon or cover the cap area or other visible clothing. The title is prominently placed in the foreground against a section not overlapping any part of the man’s figure, ensuring that it does not obscure or distort any of the visible components of his attire.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass appear integrated into the background without intersecting or distorting the man’s head or shoulders, and do they maintain consistent depth relative to the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cityscape silhouettes and the magnifying glass are artfully integrated into the background. They are placed to one side of the man’s figure, ensuring they do not intersect or distort the head or shoulder area. The placement and design suggest a well-considered composition that maintains a consistent depth, allowing these elements to provide context without conflicting with the foreground elements of the man’s figure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skin tones, facial hair, and fabric textures of the cap and shirt still visible and consistent with their original appearance, without unnatural yellowing or fading due to the sepia effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sepia effect lends a uniform warm tint to the entire composition, which inherently alters the perception of colors. While this affects the original color tones, the fabric textures of the cap and shirt remain visible, with the weave patterns discernible. However, given the nature of sepia, the original appearance will naturally be influenced by this tint, and although the textures are preserved, the color consistency with the original may show variation due to the sepia overlay.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the gray cap and shirt display consistent fabric texture and weave pattern, with no visible artifacts such as blurring, noise, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the sepia effect overlaying the entire image, the fabric textures and weave patterns of the cap and shirt remain distinct and clear. There are no visible artifacts such as blurring, noise, or unnatural highlights that affect the perception of these fabric details. The sepia tint does not interfere with the visibility of the texture, ensuring a consistent depiction of the material’s quality.",
