        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the box hosting the figurine is visually intact, with clear, straight lines and angles that are characteristic of isometric projections.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image (Image B) shows the chibi cat figure having eyes with a glossy, reflective appearance. The reflections are smooth and uniform, closely resembling the effect of real glass or polished material, with no signs of pixelation or irregular light highlights, contributing to a realistic, high-quality finish.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's figurine, positioned next to the box, mimics the fur texture of a real cat, with detailed and consistent fur patterns which are designed to emulate the smooth, realistic flow seen in natural fur. Comparing to Image A, the fur on the original realistic cat is more intricate, while the figurine's fur, although highly detailed for a figure, doesn't reach the same level of realism and texture flow.",
