      "question": "Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's design is stylized in a chibi or cartoonish form, which often simplifies features. The helmet retains a rounded shape with recognizable details such as the reflective visor, and the suit segments appear smooth without apparent jagged or broken edges. This style uses exaggeration while maintaining consistent geometry to ensure clarity and recognizability. Thus, despite the simplification for artistic expressions, the geometric consistency is preserved.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B visually represents a cartoonish depiction where textures are typically minimized for stylistic simplicity. While realistic textures are often absent, the visual design does not show uneven or repetitive patterns suggesting artificial artifacts. The texture simplifies uniformly applied grey and white zones typical to space suit designs and avoids complex patterns to maintain a clean illustration suitable for the simplified art style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, noticeable areas with accent colors such as gold are used subtly. These colors are usually applied to emblems or small connectors. The art focuses on clear boundaries within defined illustrated components, thus avoiding color bleeding into adjacent areas. As a result, the use of color is controlled and intentional, fitting the overall design. The carefully applied colors maintain separation due to the illustration's style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronaut’s limbs or the station structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, directional arrows are used as part of the informational illustration. The arrows are placed thoughtfully around the astronaut figures to indicate movement and action but do not interfere with or distort the astronaut’s limbs or the space station elements. The directionality is clear, directing attention to movement in a way that complements rather than obstructs the visual messaging of the illustration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is legibly positioned at the top of the image 'Astronaut and Space Station Dynamics' and at the bottom for labeling phases like '1. Prepare,' '2. Navigate,' '3. Operate.' The arrangement of text does not interfere with the illustration objects, thanks to the placement and font choice, which ensures visibility and readability without distortion or unnecessary effects. This placement allows the illustrations to remain the focal point.",
