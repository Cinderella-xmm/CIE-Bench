    "Question": "Q1: Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the logo on the hammer handle appears to be integrated without visible mismatches. The texture of the logo matches the handle's surface, and the color contrast is consistent with surrounding elements, ensuring a natural appearance. This conclusion is based on visually assessing the hammer handle to inspect for potential anomalies in the integration of the logo.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
    "explanation": "Image B does not contain any wood shavings with lettering; thus, there are no letters to analyze for consistency with curvature and thickness on the shavings. In evaluating for context, the wood shavings in Image B have a natural form without inlaid lettering, which would appear flattened or floating if present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
    "explanation": "Image B features what appears to be textual content rather than a rustic banner. The lighting and shadows do align with the overall scene, offering consistency. The texture appears to match the material in the image, suggesting it is not merely a digitally pasted element. This is determined by comparing ambient lighting and how shadows fall relative to adjacent objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the copper accents are visible and are evenly lit without showing abrupt color shifts or unrealistic reflections. They match the grayscale tones of surrounding elements, providing uniformity. This determination is made by observing how light is distributed across these accents without apparent inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the business card is positioned accurately in terms of perspective and scale, relative to surrounding tools and the workbench. It casts a subtle shadow that appears consistent with the ambient light source, shallow enough to match the scene's lighting dynamics. Observation tools and the position of shadows suggest a thoughtful integration of the card.",
    "answer": "Yes"
