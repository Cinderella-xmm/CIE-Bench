      "question": "Has the removal of the second zebra and grassland resulted in a clean transition without visible artifacts or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is only one zebra visible on a bright green background. The absence of the second zebra from the background suggests successful removal, as there are no visible remnants or disruptions in the image. The transition appears clean because the green plane stretches uniformly without visible artifacts or mismatched edges, suggesting a skillful edit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the green gradient plane replacing the grass blend seamlessly with the zebra and ground, maintaining natural gradients and avoiding sharp contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green background in Image B has a smooth and uniform appearance with minimal variation in color, indicating a gradient effect. This gradient blends naturally with the zebra, as there is no significant contrast or sharp edges between the animal and the plane. The overall gradient is maintained without visible interruptions or displeasing contrasts.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the zebra on the left intact and proportionally correct, with no signs of distortion or unnatural texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is depicted with accurate proportions typical of its species. The body, stripes, and legs appear consistent with a real zebra, showing no distortions or alterations. The textures look natural, and its posture does not suggest any unnatural adjustments.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the details of the zebra's stripes and the ground's texture well-preserved, ensuring high-quality representation without loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are clear and distinct. The textures of the stripes are sharp, with no blurring or artifacting, preserving the contrast typical of zebra stripes. The green plane lacks specific texture but maintains a uniform look suitable for the composition, ensuring focus on the zebra without compromising visual quality.",

      "question": "Does the final composition effectively convey a calm and solitary atmosphere without any elements disrupting the visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image conveys a calm and solitary atmosphere achieved through the solitary zebra against the expansive and uniform green background. The lack of additional elements or distractions helps maintain visual harmony, resulting in a peaceful and serene composition.",
