      "question": "Are the fingers in the central panel positioned naturally over the book page, with no unnatural bending, extra joints, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the central panel of Image B, the fingers are shown pointing to the book in a realistic manner. The fingers appear naturally curved without any signs of distortion, unnatural bending, or extra joints, resembling a typical way someone might point to or follow text in a book. The shading and angles look realistic, based on visual cues and common understanding of hand and finger positions when people read.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the hand on the left panel transition into a tree branch with a smooth, continuous shape, maintaining five fingers and no abrupt geometric breaks or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the left panel of Image B, the illustration shows a hand that transitions into a tree branch. Despite the artistic rendering of this transition, the hand maintains a smooth connection to the branch. The fingers are clearly visible and intact, without abrupt breaks or missing parts. The visual theme follows a gentle transition from a hand into a branch, which is consistent with many stylized illustrations.",

      "question": "Are the floral embellishments on the right side of the bench attached to the wooden surface without floating or misalignment, and do they have consistent lighting and shadow direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral elements on the right side of the bench appear to be part of the scene without any indication of floating or misalignment. The lighting on these embellishments seems to be consistent with the rest of the image, aligning with the existing natural light and shadows in the scene, which suggests that they are convincingly integrated into the overall composition.",

      "question": "Do the edges of the card panels display a natural leaf pattern with soft texture and color blending, without pixelation or unnatural line work?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the card panels exhibit a nature-inspired theme with leaf patterns. The edges and overall surface show fine detailing with smooth textures and color blending. There is an absence of pixelation or roughness in the artwork, indicating a polished and deliberate presentation consistent with quality illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the three panels aligned horizontally across the image, with consistent size and spacing, and do they sit within the frame without overlapping or distorting the original subject or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The panels in Image B are positioned in a clear horizontal alignment across the image. Each panel is of consistent size and equally spaced, creating a balanced layout. They are integrated into the image without any overlapping or disrupting the continuity of the main subject or background, demonstrating a coherent arrangement suitable for the collage aesthetics.",
