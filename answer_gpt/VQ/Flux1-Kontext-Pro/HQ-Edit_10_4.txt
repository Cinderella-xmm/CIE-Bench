    "Question": "Q1: Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the facial area is meant to be evaluated based on its texture and proportions. Although the face is blurred, the rest of the image displays a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, suggesting that the intention for the face is similar. However, because of the blur, we cannot definitively assess the proportions and texture quality. Despite this, the other visible elements suggest that the intention was to maintain a consistent look.",
    "answer": "No"
