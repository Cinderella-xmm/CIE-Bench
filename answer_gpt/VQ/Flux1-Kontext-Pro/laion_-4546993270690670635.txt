    "Question": "Q5: Does the warm light source create soft gradients on the face, highlight the golden embroidery, and produce gentle shadows beneath the chin and arms, with no abrupt transitions or mismatched brightness levels?",
    "explanation": "The warm light, presumably from the candle, in Image B, creates soft highlights and gradients across the image. It accentuates the golden embroidery on the robe, gently illuminates areas that protrude more, like the shoulders, and equally casts soft, consistent shadows beneath the arms. The transition between lit and shadowed areas appears gradual and natural, without any abrupt changes or mismatched lighting levels.",
