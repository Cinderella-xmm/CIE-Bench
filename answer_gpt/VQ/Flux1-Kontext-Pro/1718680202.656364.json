        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the capybara's hand is depicted holding the drink with five fingers.

      "question": "Do the lighting and reflections on the capybara, the drink, and the water surface align consistently with the direction of the sunset in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting on the capybara and the drink appears to match the direction of the sunset, as inferred by the warm tones and shadows that are coherent with the background lighting conditions. The reflection on the water also complements this direction, with the lighting on the water surface suggestive of light coming from the sunset's position. These visual elements work together harmoniously, indicating a consistent alignment with the sunset.",
