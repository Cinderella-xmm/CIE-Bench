    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the snow-capped peak exhibit a consistent, non-uniform glittering texture that mimics natural snow while avoiding blocky or artificial sparkles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow-capped peak displays a texture that is smooth and consistent, and closely resembles natural snow. There are no noticeable blocky or artificial sparkles that would detract from the authenticity of a snowy mountain. This conclusion is drawn from the visual representation where the snow seamlessly blends into the mountain, showing variation in tone and shadow, typical of real snow-covered mountains.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the tree lines and grasslands along the base of the mountain rendered with natural variation in color and density, without repeating brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree lines and grasslands exhibit a range of colors and densities that appear natural. They do not show repetitive brush-like strokes or artificial line artifacts, which would make the scene look unnatural or computer-generated. The variation in green tones and the presence of different types of foliage convey a realistic landscape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the lake surface uniformly reflective with no visible distortion, warping, or artificial shine that breaks the continuity of the mountain's reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a lake surface that reflects the mountain's image smoothly and uniformly. There is no visible distortion or warping that disrupts the reflection. The lake is calm and clear, allowing the reflection of the sky and surrounding landscape to appear intact, which is typical for a flat and reflective water surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the chalet figurines positioned at ground level along the shoreline with proper scale and shadow alignment, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, chalet figurines and other structures are positioned along the shoreline in a manner that respects the scale of the landscape. They cast subtle shadows that align with a consistent lighting direction, indicating attention to detail in maintaining realism within the miniaturized scene. The shadow alignment suggests that the scene's lighting is coherent and natural.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there any visible seams, distortions, or artificial reflections around the perimeter of the scene that suggest an unnatural glass boundary?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a boundary consistent with a glass enclosure, such as a terrarium. While the boundary encloses the scene, it appears clean with no visible seams or distortions that mar the scene's authenticity. The reflections are subtle and natural, consistent with light bouncing off transparent surfaces like glass, supporting the conclusion that the glass boundary does not introduce unnatural elements.",
