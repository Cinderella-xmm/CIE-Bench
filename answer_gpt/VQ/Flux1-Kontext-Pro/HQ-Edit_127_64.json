      "question": "Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seating icons are depicted as silhouettes of people sitting on benches in a simplified and stylized form. These figures do not overlap with any actual people or objects, as the style of Image B is entirely graphic, using vector-style silhouettes rather than depicting real objects or people. Since the icons in Image B are not in a realistic setting like in photography, there is no consideration for shadows as Image B maintains a consistent graphic style without realistic lighting details or shadow casting.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles are placed above the human figure silhouettes. They maintain a proportional size to the human figures, ensuring that they do not intersect with limbs or clothing of these silhouettes, which reflects a careful arrangement typical of clean graphic designs intended to convey information without clutter.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera icon is inserted as an additional graphic element. However, it doesn't feature an outline that overlaps the Eiffel Tower silhouette. Instead, it seems to be an annotation on engaging or capturing moments in the park. The use of icons and graphics is more symbolic and conceptual, with the icons scaled and positioned consistently within the design's stylized aesthetic but not necessarily meant to architecturally align with the Eiffel Tower.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there isn't a literal vertical split line in terms of a contrasting path division. Instead, the pathway portrayed is aligned centrally towards the Eiffel Tower in the distant background, commonly seen in layout and graphic design to guide viewer focus. This pathway runs straight and consistently from foreground to background, respecting key structures like the Eiffel Tower, indicating symmetry without a physical split line.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a stylized green hue universally across the illustration, providing a consistent aesthetic that represents a conceptual depiction rather than a realistic one. This style maintains uniformity without visible color banding or shading issues, as the entire image forms part of an infographic-style presentation. The choice of color is more symbolic across the scene, emphasizing a cohesive artistic presentation.",
