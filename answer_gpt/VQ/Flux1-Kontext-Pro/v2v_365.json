      "question": "Does the shell maintain its original pattern and texture without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shell is partially hidden because it is incorporated into a fashion ensemble. The remaining visible part of the shell seems integrated into the tortoise's new design, providing a base for the character. While not a direct depiction of a real shell's texture and pattern like in Image A, it does fit the design style of the edited image. Hence, considering the purpose of the edit, fine details are not lost in a way that disturbs the aesthetic coherence.",

        "No"
