      "question": "Are the gullwing doors reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures symmetrically placed on both sides of the car, with smooth transitions from the body and no visible warping or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gullwing doors appear in their original form, hinged at the roof and open upwards, resembling traditional gullwing doors rather than any button-like structures. These doors appear symmetrical, but they do not exhibit any characteristics of being reshaped into raised, rounded button-like structures. Additionally, there is no visible warping or clipping; they look natural as car doors. Through world knowledge, we understand gullwing doors and can see these retain that design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the front grille redesigned into a four-segment cross-shaped directional pad with evenly spaced and aligned sections, centered beneath the Mercedes emblem, and free from overlapping or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front grille maintains the original three-segment design typical of Mercedes cars, with a large circular emblem in the middle and horizontal bars. It does not exhibit the qualities of a cross-shaped directional pad; there is no redesign indicating a segmented cross shape. The grille is typical for the vehicle class and the segments are consistent with traditional grille designs.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the entire exterior surface exhibit consistent metallic red coloring with smooth gloss highlights that follow the curvature of the body and reflect ambient light realistically without abrupt transitions or flat areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the car with a smooth, metallic red finish. The highlights on the car's body follow its curves and reflect ambient light evenly, which suggests the surface is consistent in its coloration. The gloss highlights do not have abrupt transitions or appear flat; aiming realistic reflection consistent with a well-maintained vehicle. This blends with expectations of luxury car finishes, allowing for a realistic and consistent appearance.",

      "question": "Is there a detailed emblem located on the dashboard area, resembling a central control button, with clear lines and shading that match the surrounding interior materials and do not appear displaced or blurry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the car focuses mainly on the door and seats, with no specific focus on the dashboard area or clear visibility of an emblem resembling a central control button. Since no specific emblem is visible within the dashboard region, and the visible interior does not suggest the presence of such a feature, we conclude no such emblem is detailed in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is a branded logo placed centrally on the hood, shaped like a circular control element with defined edges and consistent depth, and aligned with the car’s longitudinal axis without tilting or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Mercedes-Benz emblem is visible and centrally placed on the car’s hood. It appears to have defined edges, a consistent depth, and aligns with the car’s longitudinal axis. There is no noticeable tilt or stretch, suggesting it has not been altered from the manufacturer’s standard appearance of the logo being a circular element typically found on Mercedes vehicles.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all edited components (shoulder buttons, D-pad grille, hood logo) fully attached to the car body with no floating parts, misaligned joints, or unnatural bends in the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains the original design features without any visible edits suggesting shoulder buttons or D-pad grille. The hood logo (Mercedes-Benz emblem) is properly fitted and does not show any indication of floating or misalignment. Considering these observations, all visible components appear attached and part of the original car's design, hence being fully integrated without visualization of edits.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the analysis of Image B, focusing on potential edited regions, there are no visible visual artifacts such as jagged lines, repeated patterns, or unnatural reflections. The car's exterior and features, including door edges, grille perimeter, and hood logo, present smooth transitions and realistic reflections typical of a clean automotive image, indicating no evident editing artifacts.",
