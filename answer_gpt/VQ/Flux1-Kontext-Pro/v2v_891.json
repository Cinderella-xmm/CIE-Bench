      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style renditions of the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse free from any unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monitor, computer tower, speaker, keyboard, and mouse are miniature versions but retain their geometric integrity without any distortions or broken shapes. They are consistent in shape and form with what one would expect from smaller, stylized versions of these objects. Therefore, they appear to be chibi-style renditions, which typically involve scaling down to a more compact form while maintaining the essential shape characteristics.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, based on visual analysis, the materials used for the miniatures have a consistent and realistic texture, similar to what their full-sized counterparts would have, albeit more polished. The surfaces of the computer tower casing, keyboard keys, and mouse appear smooth and are plastic-like, while the speaker mesh has a subtle texture typical of such objects, indicating they look natural without any unusual textures.",
