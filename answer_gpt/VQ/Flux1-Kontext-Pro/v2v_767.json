      "question": "Does the creature added to the image appear naturally integrated with the temple and surrounding jungle, without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the creature does not appear naturally integrated with the temple and surrounding jungle. Image B features a stylized drawing of a mythical creature accompanied by text and a spherical object, which is a departure from the realistic depiction of a temple in a jungle setting found in Image A. The artistic style of the creature and its background is illustrative rather than photographic, rendering a fantastical and artificial representation as opposed to a realistic integration. Therefore, the creature does not blend naturally with the environment seen in Image A, marked by its explicit drawing style and fanciful elements.",

      "question": "Does the creature's design reflect the temple's shape and textures accurately, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature is a distinctly different element from the temple and the surrounding jungle in Image A. It has a stylized, fantastical design that does not mimic the temple's shape or textures. The architectural detail of the temple, characterized by rectangular steps and stone textures, is not reflected in the creature's design, which features organic, exaggerated features such as spikes and a curled tail. The difference in style implies that the creature and temple are not structurally coherent and do not share congruent textures or shapes, as the temple presents realistic geometric shapes while the creature does not.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature's feet visually consistent with the temple's architectural details and natural elements, without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb in Image B is a stylized, decorative object that does not share visual consistency with the temple's architectural details or the natural elements in Image A. The temple in Image A is characterized by realistic stone textures and a natural jungle setting, while the orb has fantasy-inspired markings and smooth, round geometry, which are not typical of the temple architecture. This discrepancy highlights an inconsistency in texture and detail, reinforcing the orb as an independent artistic element rather than one integrated into the temple's natural setting.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the creature and the custom-designed orb maintain the scene's overall authenticity and natural appearance, without disrupting the harmony of the jungle and temple setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the creature and orb in Image B creates a distinctly fantastical scene that diverges from the authenticity and natural appearance of the temple and jungle in Image A. While Image A presents a realistic depiction of the jungle with a temple embedded within, Image B relies on a drawn, imaginative style to introduce new elements. This shift away from realism disrupts the harmony seen in the original setting, creating a scene focused on mythical and illustrated content. Thus, while visually engaging, it does not maintain authenticity or natural harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the creature's invented name and elemental type displayed clearly beside or beneath it, without interfering with the visual quality or introducing any distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature's name and elemental type are displayed clearly beside it, utilizing simple typography that fits well within the framed design of the illustration. The text does not interfere with the visual quality of the scene as it complements the illustrative style and adds context without overwhelming it. The placement is moderate and ensures clarity without becoming a distracting element, thus maintaining the aesthetic integrity of the image.",
