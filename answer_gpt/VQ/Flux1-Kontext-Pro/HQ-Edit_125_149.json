      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the vertical towers now resemble tree limbs with natural bark texture and leaf coverage, without visible seams or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vertical towers of the structure have been transformed to resemble tree-like forms, complete with a bark texture and extensions that mimic tree limbs. These new structures are seamlessly integrated into the scene, without any visible seams or geometric distortions, which gives them a natural appearance consistent with tree growth. This change contrasts with Image A, where the towers were originally more industrial and structured. The change has made the towers look like organic parts of the forest environment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arches now formed into a continuous ribcage structure with natural curvature and spacing, free from broken or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the arches appear to have been reimagined as a continuous ribcage structure. They possess a natural curvature and spacing between each rib that is regular and smooth, presenting a harmonious flow similar to skeletal structures in nature. This cohesive design lacks broken or misaligned segments, maintaining an organic and intact appearance, which differs from the uniform and geometric arches in Image A.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the suspension cables been replaced with vine-like tendrils that show natural growth patterns, such as twisting or clinging, and do they blend with the forest environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows that the suspension cables are no longer uniform metal lines; instead, they have been replaced by vine-like tendrils. These tendrils exhibit features typical of natural growth, such as twisting forms and clingings to other structures like trees, something not possible with rigid cables. The tendrils harmonize with the greenery of the forest environment, making them appear as an organic part of the surroundings, contrasting with the more engineered cables observed in Image A.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bridgeâ€™s foundations now consist of moss-covered roots extending into the stream, with natural branching and tapering, rather than solid stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foundation of the bridge has visually transformed into a natural root system. These roots are covered with moss, enhancing the organic feel, and they extend into the water with natural branching and tapering, which is characteristic of how roots grow. This contrasts with Image A, where the foundation was solid and constructed as typical for a man-made structure. The new design integrates seamlessly with the natural environment, contributing to the illusion that the bridge is part of the forest's natural ecosystem.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is there a bark-textured head structure with two glowing emerald eyes positioned at the top of the bridge, with the glow confined and not causing light bleed or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a head-like structure at the top of the bridge that resembles a creature made out of bark. It is equipped with two prominently glowing emerald eyes. The glow of these eyes is contained within their eye sockets, without bleeding into surrounding areas or creating unnatural highlights, which suggests the luminous effect is deliberately focused. In comparison, Image A does not feature any such head structure; thus, this is a new addition with a distinct aesthetic impact.",
