    "Question": "Q1: Does the character’s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s face has been converted into a half-cartoon style, which typically involves simplified features yet maintains an essence of natural proportion. Although specific details like contours are blurred, the remaining elements such as ear size and neck alignment appear consistent with natural human anatomy in a stylized form, lacking obvious distortions common in poorly done cartoon transformations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the book in front of the character remains largely rectangular and aligns with the traditional shape of a book, exhibiting consistent thickness of pages and properly aligned edges, which is in alignment with how a typical book is structured. There are no visible warping or stretching artifacts that suggest a discrepancy in geometry.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character's sleeves are depicted in a way that conveys the natural flow of fabric. The lighting and shadows indicate a decent understanding of how fabric folds and drapes under gravity, with shadow depth adding to the dimensional perception of the sleeve texture, similar to real clothing behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the buttons show a clear depiction of golden filigree details which appear smoothly integrated into the button surfaces. The transformation to a cartoon style maintains clean lines and, despite the style shift, avoids any jagged edges or mismatched reflections, indicating attention to detail in rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformation of library shelves into a wooden frame-like background is done while retaining the expected characteristics of wood, such as grain and tone consistency. The edge alignment in the frame suggests proper spatial logic, and the overall image avoids broken geometry, creating a structured and logically consistent space.",
    "answer": "Yes"
