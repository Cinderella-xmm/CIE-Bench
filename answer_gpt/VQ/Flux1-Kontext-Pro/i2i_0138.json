      "correct_answer": "Yes",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, although the aesthetic is a sketch, the details such as the outlines and forms of the scissors are clear and consistent with the sketch style. The placement of the texts does not hinder these details, as they are positioned around, rather than on, the scissor edges.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a well-balanced composition where the scissors and the texts 'Sharp' and 'Clean' are placed in a manner that complements each other. The texts are strategically placed to avoid overcrowding, maintaining the visual plausibility and thematic unity of this sketch-styled image.",
