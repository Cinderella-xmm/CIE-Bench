    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the cogwheel joints clearly defined, aligned with the frame's geometry, and rendered with consistent metallic texture and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bicycle's cogwheel joints should show clear definition and align seamlessly with the frame, maintaining coherent geometry. The metallic texture and shading should reflect light consistently across the surface, displaying well-defined edges and particulars typical of metal. Upon examining the image, these elements appear well-integrated, with consistent shading and alignment crucial for mechanical integrity, suggesting a high level of render quality and detail orientation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the carapace-shaped seat have detailed surface textures, proper curvature, and seamless attachment to the seat post without visible seams or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the seat appears smoothly contoured with a homogeneous texture present across its surface. It should exhibit a continuous appearance from the seat post without artifacts like seams or spatial warping that could disrupt visual harmony. The detailed textures contribute to realistic material depiction, maintaining its form regardless of perspective viewed, indicating meticulous attention given in its portrayal.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mechanical legs have realistic hinge mechanisms, correct proportions, and no overlapping or misplaced segments that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within Image B, the mechanical legs should demonstrate functionality through realistic hinge placements and correct proportional relationships, supporting feasible operations without overlapping or misplaced components. Their presence should merge seamlessly with the overall design and not disrupt the space it occupies, affirming adherence to practical geometry and spatial coherence. The evaluation finds that these elements contribute effectively to the intended mechanical theme without spatial inconsistencies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wingtips smoothly attached to the top tube, showing consistent copper coloring, reflective properties, and no jagged edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining the wingtips in Image B involves checking attachment points on the top tube, ensuring smooth transitions suggesting durability and elegance inherent in design. The consistent copper coloring matched with reflective properties delivers an authentic look devoid of jagged edges or noticeable texture repetitions, which would undermine material realism. The smoothness and continuation confirm well-managed material properties and design execution.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the clock faces clearly visible, properly embedded in the handlebars, and free from texture artifacts, incorrect lighting, or distorted numerals/runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Focusing on Image B, clock faces on the handlebars require discernibility and correct orientation, embedded seamlessly without disorienting texture artifacts or flawed lighting conditions that interfere with numeral clarity. The clocks should appear distinctly integrated within design intention, embodying clarity and purpose unperturbed by distortions or lighting missteps. The visible coherence of clock details fosters their reliability and ease of understanding.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do all newly added mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) share consistent material properties, such as metallic sheen, color tone, and surface imperfections, without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The evaluation of Image B highlights the importance of material consistency across various mechanical elements. They should share a unified metallic sheen, similar color tones, and subtle imperfections that signify realism and craftsmanship. Any abrupt breaks would hinder visual continuity crucial for cohesive design implementation. The observed harmony across these components confirms the careful alignment of material aspects, enhancing the cohesive aesthetic appeal.",
