    "Question": "Q1: Is the text 'flyaway' added below the painting seamlessly integrated into the image without disrupting its authentic appearance?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'flyaway' is added below the painting on the wooden furniture. The font and style of 'flyaway' blend naturally with the decor, simulating a handwritten note that naturally fits into the scene. The position and scale do not detract from any element in the composition, and thus the text seems as intentionally placed as any other decor. This integration gives the feeling that it is a part of the entire setup, not feeling out of place or forced.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the handwriting of 'flyaway' appear natural and consistent with what one would expect on a postcard-style image?",
    "explanation": "The text 'flyaway' in Image B is rendered in a cursive, script-like font which is commonly seen in casual, handwritten-style notes, similar to calligraphy that could be found on a postcard. This style does not clash with the existing decor and complements the artistic nature depicted in the painting above, suggesting that it is fitting for an artistic or personal message setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the text 'flyaway' maintain proper proportion and not cover any significant part of the painting or adjacent objects?",
    "explanation": "The text 'flyaway' is proportionally scaled and positioned on the wooden surface under the painting. It does not overlay or obscure any part of the painting nor any significant features of the furniture or decor items, like the plant and vase. This careful placement ensures the functionality and aesthetic integrity of every component in the image is preserved.",
