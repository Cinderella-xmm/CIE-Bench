      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the ogre's body have simplified yet coherent proportions with no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre's proportions are simplified, resembling a stylized figurine rather than a realistic rendition. The limbs are smooth and rounded, with distinct joints and muscle definition. The angles look natural within the context of a stylized figurine, lacking any distortion that would suggest unnatural bending or misalignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the surface of the ogre’s body and clothing uniformly matte with no shiny reflections or residual skin texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the ogre with a matte finish across both the skin and clothing. There's a uniform lack of shine, indicative of a material like plastic or painted surfaces typical in collectible figurines. This matte surface is consistent with the appearance of manufactured toys, which generally avoid glossy textures unless intentionally highlighted.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the foam club visibly softer in edge definition, larger in scale, and held securely in the ogre’s right hand without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foam club is characterized by its exaggerated size and rounded edges, hinting at a playful design choice typical in toy figures. The club is held securely, with no visual distortion at the point of grip, reflecting the added stability you'd expect from a figurine created to hold accessories rigidly.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the fur-trimmed cape attached at the shoulders, extending downward without clipping into the body or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cape appears firmly attached at the shoulders, exhibiting a natural flow down the back of the figure. There is no evidence of the cape clipping through other body parts or appearing detached—it maintains its integrity and attachment points, reflecting craftsmanship common in figurine drop detail.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the rocky base fully grounded, with the plaque clearly engraved and readable, and no floating or shadow inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocky base in Image B is grounded effectively, with shadows consistent with what you would expect under stable lighting. The plaque is clearly engraved with the text 'MIGHTY OGRE,' avoiding any semblance of floating or edge misalignments that would suggest rendering errors. This setup is typical of orderly product displays where every element is meant to enhance readability and coherence.",
