      "question": "Does the kitten's body appear structurally consistent without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kitten's body is shown nestled within a blue blanket. The body seems proportionate and natural relative to the kitten's head and facial features. The paws are positioned naturally at the front of the body. There are no visible irregularities suggesting structural inconsistency or artifact presence. The appearance aligns with realistic images of kittens curled in a cozy position.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fur details around the kittenâ€™s face natural and free from any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur on the kitten's face appears to be detailed and well-defined, with smooth and natural textures. The stripes and color variations in the fur resemble the typical appearance of a kitten. There is no noticeable loss of detail or presence of any unnatural textures that would imply editing flaws.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the kitten's position and perspective accurately simulate a 3D jumps-out effect without breaking its geometric shapes or distorting its proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the kitten in a way that it seems to slightly emerge from the blanket, contributing to a subtle 3D effect. The perspective does not distort the natural proportions of the kitten. The head, ears, and body segments maintain a coherent geometric structure without any apparent distortion, successfully simulating depth without breaking proportion.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the material properties of the blue blanket around the kitten look natural, supporting the 3D illusion without introducing any artificial artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blanket in Image B appears soft and textured, with realistic fur-like protrusions typical of a cozy material. Its interaction with lighting creates a natural appearance without any evident artifacts. The blanket's folds and how it cradles the kitten support a believable 3D environment and do not exhibit any digital manipulation signs that could break the illusion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the kitten's paws shaped naturally, consistently placed, and free from any distortion or unrealistic deformations after applying the 3D effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the paws are correctly positioned and aligned with the kitten's body. They exhibit the expected rounded shape and distinguishable claw markings, commensurate with their place at the front, aiding a cohesive natural appearance. The image does not indicate any distortion or strange deformation that would suggest a flaw in the editing process.",
