      "question": "Does the plastic figurine maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the character's body, avoiding distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plastic figurine represents the character Thor and appears to maintain proportionate body structure typical of an action figure model. The musculature and armor design supports the character's superhero identity, reflecting physical rationality without any evident distortion or broken geometric shapes. By comparing with common superhero figures which typically follow certain standards of proportions for aesthetic value, this figurine fits into those conventions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added lighting effects around the plastic figurine seamlessly integrated with its surface and the surrounding desk, avoiding unnatural highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting effects around the figurine, especially near the hammer, create a glow which integrates well with the scene. The light does not produce any conspicuous disconnect with the figurine's surface or create uneven shadows on the desk, maintaining plausibility and visual consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the hands of the plastic figurine holding the hammer retain natural textures and shapes, with no more than five fingers and no signs of ergonomic distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine's hands holding the hammer appear to have a realistic texture that imitates skin. The number of fingers is consistent with human anatomy, showing five fingers, and the hand position efficiently grips the hammer without any visible ergonomic distortion or abnormal appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Has the plastic figurine retained a structurally sound head and face consistent with the character's identity, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B's figurine displays a structurally sound head with facial details adequately represented, corresponding to the character Thor's iconic features, like long blonde hair. Although blurred, the overall shaping and sculpting of the head and hair is consistent with superhero figures, retaining identity without unnatural textures.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor and cape of the figurine in Image B are designed to be cohesive elements that match the overall look of the figurine. The materials used simulate the realistic textures of fabric and metal without showing any disturbing discrepancies that might affect visual plausibility, remaining consistent with the overall model design.",
