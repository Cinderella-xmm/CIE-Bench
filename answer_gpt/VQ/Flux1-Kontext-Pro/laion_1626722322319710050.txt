    "Question": "Q1: Does the metallic statue have five fingers on each hand, with natural joint angles and smooth surface transitions, and no visible seams or distorted geometry?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic statue appears to have distinct hands that are well-crafted with five fingers each. The fingers are naturally jointed, and transitions between different parts of the hand appear smooth, indicating a high level of craftsmanship. There's no indication of visible seams or distorted geometry, suggesting the design is coherent and realistic in its depiction of human anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the leaves of the miniature trees semi-transparent, allowing light to pass through them, and positioned at a distance from the statue that matches their reduced scale without overlapping the figure unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the leaves of the miniature trees exhibit a fine level of detail, and their positioning suggests an intention to model natural growth. The small tree branches do not appear to overlap with the statue itself, maintaining a proportional distance that matches their scaled-down size. The leaves do not give an impression of semi-transparency as they appear opaque.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the engraved plaques flush with the base surface, with readable text and consistent depth, and do they follow the contour of the pedestal without appearing detached or warped?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plaque on the dome stand is visible and appears integral to the design. The text is legible, indicating good embossing quality and attention to detail. The plaque seems to follow the contour of the dome stand and does not appear detached or warped, suggesting precise and accurate instillation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the glass dome fully transparent with smooth, continuous curvature, showing accurate reflections of nearby objects and sky, and free from jagged edges or internal distortions?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B exhibits high transparency and has a smooth, continuous curvature. It reflects light effectively, showing nearby objects and sky reflections without distortions that would suggest jagged edges or internal imperfections. This indicates a well-crafted glass dome.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the dome stand feature a polished stone surface with subtle texture variation, and are the vine patterns clearly defined, following natural growth patterns without breaking or repeating unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the dome stand showcases a polished stone finish with intricate vine patterns decorating the surface. These patterns appear naturally flowing without abrupt breaks or unnatural repetitions, attributing to a realistic and artistic design pattern on the base.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Is the glass dome positioned above the statue and base without clipping through any part of the figure or pedestal, and does it rest securely on the dome stand without floating or tilting?",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B sits securely atop the dome stand, encapsulating the statue and base without clipping through any parts. Its position appears stable and aligned, with no signs of tilting or floating, indicating a well-aligned and stable setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"
