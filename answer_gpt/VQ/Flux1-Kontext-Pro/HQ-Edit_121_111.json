      "question": "Are the brushstroke effects and color transitions throughout the image smooth and consistent, without visible jagged edges or unnatural smudging in the fur, grass, or sky?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke effects and the quality of the color transitions play a crucial role in the overall aesthetic appeal. Observing the fur, grass, and sky, we see smooth transitions and consistent brushstrokes. The fur appears well blended with soft transitions between colors, maintaining a natural look without jagged edges or smudging. Comparison to Image A is not necessary as we independently observe the smooth quality of the transitions in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the light pink and pale yellow accents on the squirrel’s fur blend seamlessly with the surrounding gray and orange fur, maintaining natural texture and avoiding isolated patches or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining Image B, the squirrel's fur displays accents of light pink and pale yellow that blend into the gray and orange fur. These accents enhance the texture without creating isolated patches or overly bright spots, suggesting an intentional blending for artistic effect. Without needing to compare to Image A, the seamless integration and natural look are evident.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the wings attached to the squirrel’s back in a position that follows natural shoulder anatomy, with appropriate size and curvature, and do they show consistent shading and transparency matching the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wings on the squirrel appear anatomically positioned, aligning with the shoulder area naturally. The size and curvature complement the body proportions, avoiding any disproportionate appearance. The shading and transparency are consistent with the watercolor style, blending well with the surrounding features. Inspection of Image B alone confirms the appropriateness and artistic continuity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the jewels replacing the acorns have defined facets and reflective surfaces that respond realistically to light, casting appropriate shadows on the grass, and are they sized consistently with the squirrel’s hand and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows jewels in place of acorns that possess defined facets and reflective surfaces. These jewels interact realistically with light, casting shadows that correspond logically to their surroundings, such as the grass. They are appropriately sized relative to the squirrel’s hand and mouth, indicating an intentional and coherent design choice. This observation can be conclusively made from Image B alone.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the blurred background a gradual transition from the foreground grass to a soft-focus forest, with no abrupt edges or repeated patterns that suggest artificial blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B demonstrates a gradual transition from the detailed grass in the foreground to a soft-focus depiction of the forest. This transition lacks abrupt edges or repetition, implying a natural blurring effect typical in artistic renderings. Such an effect is evident when focusing solely on Image B, confirming an intention to create depth without artificial patterns.",

      "question": "Is the text \"The Jewel Gatherer of Whispering Woods\" placed in the sky such that it appears softly integrated with the clouds, with no harsh outlines or unnatural glow, and is it legible without disrupting the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text is neat and integrated into the sky, blending softly with the clouds without harsh outlines or an unnatural glow. It maintains legibility and does not disrupt the continuity of the background. These observations from Image B confirm the appropriateness of text placement and style.",
