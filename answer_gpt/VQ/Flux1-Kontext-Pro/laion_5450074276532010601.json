      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red helmet and blue cap are depicted on the paddles in a cartoon style with exaggerated poses. The elements maintain a scaled size proportional to the paddles, fitting onto the paddle heads appropriately without significant distortion. The helmets and caps appear integrated into the image without signs of stretching or warping on the paddles. The visualization suggests a seamless integration consistent with cartoon stylistic choices.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon elements are designed to be a seamless part of the paddles, corresponding with the overall artistic style. The facial features and accessories show smooth integration with consistent shading. There are no visible stitching or sharp edges, typical for cartoon artwork that emphasizes exaggeration and simplicity over photorealistic precision.",

      "question": "Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the depiction of the box features golden edges that seem to adhere to the schematic of confining to the perimeter of the box lid and base. The edges do not appear to extend into the interior nor form disconnected segments. The intent is a traditional treasure chest design, where gold serves as an ornamental boundary.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubbles are designed with tails that aim towards relevant objects, such as the paddles, ensuring visual clarity without overlapping other elements like the box or paddle handles, which could obscure the intended communication in the storyline or distract from the visual flow.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B displays a background styled like a treasure map with lines that appear consistent and uniform based on cartoon art standards. The lines do not exhibit pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths. The intention is a clean illustrative style that maintains a smooth and cohesive appearance typical of cartoon depictions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, assuming the paddles are part of the animated storyline, they appear tilted upward slightly as part of the exaggerated action depiction in the cartoon, yet there's no evidence of unrealistic support loss, suggesting continued plausibility of the positioning based on stylistic cues. The animated box design suggests structural support within a cartoon context.",
