    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the crown-like head formed from the lid free of distorted edges or broken geometry, and does it maintain a consistent metallic surface with the original teapot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second image, the crown-like head appears well-defined without any distorted edges or broken geometry. The surface exhibits consistent metallic detailing similar to the original teapot design shown in Image A, maintaining uniformity in material and texture. The smoothness and intricate detailing reflect the original teapot's qualities, suggesting accurate transformation without loss of consistency.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the spout-to-beak transformation maintain a smooth, continuous metallic surface without cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beak in Image B, which is an evolution of the spout from Image A, shows a smooth and continuous metallic surface. Through world knowledge, the transformation is logical with no visible cracks, unnatural bends, or texture discontinuities affecting the continuity from the original teapot spout. The detailing and shape are consistent, indicating a well-executed transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tail formed from the handle smoothly curved and proportionally aligned with the body, without abrupt angles or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tail is derived from the handle of the teapot in Image A. The transformation exhibits a smoothly curved form, proportionally integrated with the owl body. There are no abrupt angles or discrepancies in material, maintaining a smooth transition from the teapot handle. The consistent metallic surface further supports the logical progression.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mechanical eyes positioned symmetrically on the head, with visible cogs and soft glow that do not cause halos, color bleeding, or texture mismatch with surrounding metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical eyes are evenly positioned on the owl's head and exhibit symmetric alignment. There are visible cogs, and the eyes feature a soft glow that blends harmoniously with the metallic texture without causing halos or color bleeding. The integration of the glow with the metal surface maintains consistency and depth.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden branch beneath the owl well-integrated into the scene, with consistent wood texture, shadowing, and depth relative to the original table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden branch in Image B is analyzed independently as not related directly to the original table surface shown in Image A, but it is well-integrated into its scene. The wood texture is consistent, with realistic shadowing and depth. It complements the owlâ€™s placement effectively, demonstrating artistic coherence and scene integration.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the engraved patterns across the body now resemble metallic feathers with consistent layering and directionality, without pixelation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, engraved patterns are transformed into metallic feathers. The detailing shows consistent layering and directionality, mimicking feather patterns while maintaining a high level of detail. There is no visible pixelation or loss of intricacy compared to the original engravings in Image A, supporting an effective transformation.",
