    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges and contours of the LEGO car body aligned with the original vehicle’s shape, with no visible gaps, overlapping blocks, or warped sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO car is constructed with a clean and precise alignment of bricks that closely mimics the original car shape seen in Image A. There are no visible gaps, overlaps, or warped areas. The contours follow the vehicle’s body consistently, suggesting a careful and accurate build that respects the original proportions and design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the red and blue translucent LEGO pieces positioned exactly where the original emergency lights were, and do they appear transparent rather than solid or discolored?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the red and blue LEGO pieces are situated on the roof, in the same position as the emergency lights on the original car in Image A. These bricks are translucent, allowing light to pass through in a manner that replicates real lights, avoiding any solid or discolored appearance, thus maintaining transparency similar to Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the window areas of the LEGO car consist of solid beige bricks without any transparent or see-through elements, making them visually inconsistent with real-world windows?",
    "explanation": "The window areas on Image B’s LEGO car appear to use solid bricks rather than transparent ones. This design choice deviates from real-world window materials, indicating non-transparency and creating inconsistency compared to the transparent windows seen in the original vehicle in Image A.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the grille and wheel components built from small LEGO blocks that maintain the original patterns and shapes, with no missing, misaligned, or distorted pieces?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a LEGO car with grille and wheel components carefully assembled from small LEGO pieces that replicate the patterns and shapes seen in the original vehicle from Image A. The construction appears precise, without any missing, misaligned, or distorted parts, indicating a faithful representation of the original design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO car resting on a flat, uniform matte gray surface with no visible seams, texture mismatches, or lighting inconsistencies compared to the car’s shadow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the car is on a matte gray surface devoid of seams or texture mismatches, with lighting consistent with the car’s shadow. This contrasts with the more textured street surface seen in Image A, creating a uniform and error-free base in the LEGO image for the car to rest upon.",
    "answer": "Yes"
