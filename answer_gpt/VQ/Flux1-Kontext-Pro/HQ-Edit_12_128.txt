    "Question": "Q3: Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
    "explanation": "The pendulum in Image B is depicted as a faceted crystal that appears symmetrical, with clarity and proper suspension by chains. It does not show signs of floating or misalignment, indicating a careful and precise integration with the rest of the clock.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wall shows a continuous and uniform marble texture without visible stitching or artificial boundaries, suggesting a natural appearance. The shadows beneath the clock are soft and consistent with what would be expected from a real light source interaction with the marble, indicating an authentic depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
    "explanation": "The crystal components in Image B are visually cohesive. The integration between the frame, face, and pendulum is seamless, with no visible gaps or material inconsistencies. Reflections on the crystal appear natural and consistent, without any unnatural artifacts or discrepancies, indicating a well-executed design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
