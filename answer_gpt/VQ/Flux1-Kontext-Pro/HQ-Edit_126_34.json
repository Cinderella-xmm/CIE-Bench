      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the edges of the cabinâ€™s roof, walls, and windows clearly defined and geometrically consistent, even with visible brushstrokes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin's structure has been rendered using distinct brushstrokes, giving it a painted appearance. The edges of the roof, walls, and windows are distinct and follow a geometric shape consistent with a traditional cabin. Despite the painterly style, the fundamental geometric integrity is maintained, allowing recognition of the architectural form. Therefore, the edges are indeed clearly defined and geometrically consistent, despite the loose brushwork.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the surrounding fir trees maintain their vertical orientation and layered foliage structure despite the use of loose brushwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features fir trees painted with broad brushstrokes, which achieve a more impressionistic style. However, the vertical orientation typical of such trees is maintained, along with a semblance of the layered foliage structure. The brushwork conveys the idea of tree shape effectively while keeping a sense of structure, despite the looser artistic interpretation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the smoke rise straight upward from the chimney and gradually blur outward, mimicking natural dispersion in cold air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smoke is depicted rising from the chimney and slightly spreading as it ascends, resembling the natural dispersion seen on a cold day. The brushstrokes represent this effect well, with the smoke becoming less defined as it moves higher into the sky, imitating how smoke naturally behaves in the atmosphere.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the snow covering the roof, ground, and tree branches uniformly distributed and textured in a way that suggests natural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B represents snow with thick brushstrokes that convey the texture of accumulated snow on the roof, ground, and tree branches. The distribution looks deliberate and follows where snow would naturally fall and stay, even given the painterly approach. The visual consistency indicates a natural accumulation, aligning with world knowledge of snow behavior.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the illuminated windows and string lights along the eaves softly blended into the scene, without harsh outlines or glowing halos that break the stylistic consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illumination from the windows and string lights is portrayed with a softness that blends into the surrounding painted environment. Harsh outlines or exaggerated halos are absent, allowing the lighting to integrate with the overall stylistic expression without disrupting the painterly consistency.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the foreground elements (small trees, fence) appear closer than the midground cabin and background trees, preserving depth and spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the edited image, the foreground elements such as the small trees and fence are positioned to create depth, using a smaller scale compared to the midground cabin and background trees. This effective use of scale maintains spatial logic, helping the viewer perceive these items as being closer to the observer.",
