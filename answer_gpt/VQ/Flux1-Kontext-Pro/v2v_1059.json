      "question": "Do the zebras maintain their signature striped coats with no unnatural texture or loss of detail in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras retain a realistic and detailed striped pattern that appears consistent with what one would expect in nature. The stripes are clear, distinct, and there is no indication of a chibi-style or overly stylized texture that would detract from the natural appearance. By analyzing the detailed presentation of the stripes against common representations of zebras, it is evident that their signature coats remain visually intact without unnatural alterations.",

      "question": "Are the lush green field and fencing preserved in a photorealistic manner without any visible distortion or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a green field that appears consistent in color and texture with what is typically observed in natural grassy areas. The fence is similarly detailed and intact, without distortion. By considering the typical appearance of fields and fences, and observing that all elements are visually coherent and appropriate in the scene, it is clear that the environment maintains a photorealistic quality without visible artifacts.",

      "question": "Do the zebras retain their realistic grazing stances without any distortion or deformation in the chibi-style 3D recreation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras are positioned in natural grazing stances, with their heads lowered to the ground in a way typical of grazing animals. These postures align with natural movements and do not show any signs of distortion that would suggest a chibi-style recreation. Thus, the zebras appear realistically posed without abnormal modifications.",

      "question": "Does the ornate decorative photo frame integrate seamlessly with the scene without disrupting the visual coherence or introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The photo frame in Image B is a distinct element added around the scene. While it is ornate and decorative, it outlines the scene without overlapping or causing visual artifacts within the scene itself. Although the frame is a distinctly non-natural element, it does not disrupt the coherence of the zebras and field scene inside it. By analyzing how frames generally separate from the internal image, it integrates without issues or inconsistencies.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the chibi-style 3D zebras and the photorealistic background smooth and believable without any noticeable artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebras appear as a seamless part of the overall scene, with no noticeable boundary or mismatch between them and the green field. Such continuity is expected in a natural setting where animals are part of their environment. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistencies detected where the zebras interact with the background. Hence, the transition is smooth and believable based on visual analysis.",
