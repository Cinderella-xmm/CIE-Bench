    "Question": "Q1: Does the silhouette of the rider maintain correct limb proportions and joint alignment without unnatural elongation or compression?",
    "explanation": "The silhouette of the rider on the can in Image B is a stylized, simplified representation. It appears to be a black outline of a motocross rider leaning forward on a motorcycle. From a visual analysis, the limbs—arms, legs, and torso—are proportionally aligned with typical human anatomy for a rider in motion. The arms are bent at the elbows, gripping the handlebars, and the legs are positioned naturally over the bike's foot pegs, consistent with standard riding posture. There is no visible elongation or compression of limbs that would suggest distortion. The silhouette maintains anatomical plausibility, even though it is not photorealistic. Given that silhouettes are inherently abstract, the proportions appear intentional and correctly scaled relative to the motorcycle.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the sand streaks in the background smoothly blended with the motion blur and do they follow the direction of travel without sharp, unnatural breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features dynamic sand streaks that simulate motion blur, suggesting high-speed movement across a desert track. These streaks are curved and radiate outward from the center of motion, following the expected trajectory of dust kicked up by a speeding motorcycle. The blending of the sand streaks into the background appears smooth, with gradual transitions between tones of orange and brown, mimicking natural wind dispersal. There are no abrupt edges or jagged lines that would indicate digital artifacts or unnatural breaks. The flow of the streaks aligns with the direction of travel implied by the rider’s lean and the positioning of the motorcycle, reinforcing a sense of speed and continuity. This suggests careful design to ensure realism in motion depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the 'RaceFuel' text clearly legible and positioned without obscuring key parts of the rider or motorcycle, and does it blend cohesively with the overall design?",
    "explanation": "The 'RaceFuel' text is prominently displayed in bold white lettering across the lower half of the can, with a colorful racing line graphic flowing beneath it. The font is large, clean, and easily readable against the dark background of the can. The placement of the text avoids overlapping with the silhouette of the rider or motorcycle, which is located higher on the can. Instead, the text sits below the rider, leaving the central figure unobstructed. The design integrates well with the theme—using a racing motif and dynamic typography—creating a cohesive branding effect. The color contrast ensures legibility, and the layout supports both aesthetic appeal and functional communication. Therefore, the text is both legible and strategically placed without interfering with other visual elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the track outline in the upper-right corner form a continuous, closed loop without self-intersections or broken segments?",
    "explanation": "The track outline in the upper-right corner of Image B is a stylized representation of a racetrack, depicted as a thin, dashed line with colored dots indicating turns. Visually inspecting the shape, it forms a continuous path that loops back on itself, creating a closed circuit. There are no visible gaps or breaks in the line, and the segments connect smoothly at each turn. Additionally, there are no self-intersections—no part of the track crosses over another section in a way that would make it non-planar. The design resembles typical race track schematics seen in video games or event maps, where such outlines are meant to represent a complete course. Thus, based on visual cues and common design standards for track diagrams, the outline is continuous and properly formed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the speedometer icon positioned correctly at the bottom of the image with a clear, non-deformed dial and needle pointing to maximum speed?",
    "explanation": "The speedometer icon is located at the bottom of the can in Image B, beneath the 'RaceFuel' text. It features a circular dial with tick marks and a red needle pointing toward the far right, indicating maximum speed. The dial is symmetrical and well-defined, with no visible warping or deformation. The needle is straight and aligned properly within the gauge, suggesting peak performance. The design is consistent with typical speedometer aesthetics, using color coding (red for high speed) and a clear scale. While the exact numerical values are not labeled, the visual cue of the needle at the extreme end implies maximum output, which aligns with the energetic theme of the product. Therefore, the speedometer is correctly positioned, visually intact, and functionally coherent within the context of the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
