    "Question": "Q1: Have the brushstrokes added to the sofa preserved its structural integrity without causing distortion or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa has been rendered with thick, expressive brushstrokes characteristic of Van Gogh's style, particularly evident in the swirling patterns and visible impasto texture. Despite this stylistic transformation, the fundamental structure of the sofa — including its armrests, back cushions, seat cushions, and legs — remains clearly identifiable. The brushstrokes follow the contours of the sofa, maintaining its three-dimensional form and proportions. While the texture is highly stylized, there is no evidence of geometric distortion or unnatural warping; instead, the strokes enhance the visual depth and volume. This suggests that the artistic treatment respects the object’s original shape while applying a painterly effect. Therefore, based on visual analysis combined with knowledge of how impressionistic techniques can preserve form through directional brushwork, the structural integrity is maintained.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the wall, including the framed painting, appear naturally integrated with the rest of the room after the style conversion, without any broken geometric shapes or lost fine details?",
    "explanation": "The wall in Image B has been transformed using Van Gogh-style brushstrokes, with dynamic swirls and vivid color contrasts typical of his post-impressionist technique. The framed painting retains its rectangular shape and position relative to the sofa, suggesting careful alignment during the style transfer. The frame itself appears intact, with consistent thickness and corners preserved. The surrounding wall features energetic, swirling patterns that extend seamlessly around the frame, indicating no abrupt breaks or misalignments. Furthermore, the lighting and shadows are reinterpreted in a painterly manner but still suggest spatial coherence. There is no visible loss of fine details such as the edges of the frame or the subtle gradations within the painting. The integration between the painted wall and the artwork feels cohesive, as if both were part of the same canvas. This indicates that the style conversion was applied uniformly without disrupting geometric continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the plant's leaves depicted with Van Gogh-style brushstrokes while still retaining a recognizable and plausible appearance without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The plant in Image B exhibits broad, textured strokes consistent with Van Gogh’s use of thick paint and directional lines. The leaves maintain their general shape and arrangement — elongated, pointed, and layered — which aligns with the real-world morphology of a tropical plant like a bird-of-paradise or similar species. Although the edges are softened by brushwork, the overall silhouette and internal structure (such as veins) remain discernible. The green hues vary in intensity and direction, mimicking natural light and shadow, but without creating illogical forms or floating fragments. No unnatural artifacts such as disjointed leaf sections or impossible overlaps are present. The stylization enhances rather than obscures the plant’s identity. Given that Van Gogh often exaggerated nature’s forms while preserving recognizability, this depiction fits within expected artistic conventions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Has the side table and lamp been converted to fit the Van Gogh style while preserving their realistic proportions and physical logic, avoiding any distortion or loss of fine details?",
    "explanation": "The side table and lamp in Image B have undergone a stylistic transformation into Van Gogh’s signature brushstroke pattern. The table maintains its circular top and tripod legs, with clear delineation between components despite the textured rendering. The lamp base, stem, and shade retain their respective shapes and relative sizes, suggesting proportional accuracy. The brushstrokes flow along the surfaces, following the curvature of the objects, which helps preserve their three-dimensionality. There is no evidence of stretching, flattening, or misalignment that would compromise physical logic. Fine details such as the small metallic accent on the lamp base are still visible, albeit stylized. The interplay of light and shadow on the lampshade is represented through swirling yellows and whites, consistent with Van Gogh’s treatment of light sources. Thus, the conversion respects both artistic expression and structural fidelity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do all elements in the room maintain a harmonious and plausible arrangement in Van Gogh style, ensuring no disruption in the spatial relationships among objects?",
    "explanation": "All elements in Image B — the sofa, plant, side table, lamp, rug, and wall art — are arranged in a way that mirrors the original composition from Image A, indicating intentional preservation of spatial relationships. The sofa remains centered beneath the painting, the plant is positioned to the left, and the table is placed to the right, forming a balanced layout. The perspective appears consistent: the floor recedes naturally, and the height of objects corresponds to realistic proportions. Even though every surface is covered in Van Gogh-style brushwork, the relative positions and scale of objects remain unchanged. The artistic style unifies the entire scene without altering depth cues or object placement. There are no floating items, overlapping inconsistencies, or misplaced shadows that would suggest spatial disruption. The harmony stems from applying the same stylistic filter across all elements, thereby maintaining coherence in both form and function.",
    "answer": "Yes"
