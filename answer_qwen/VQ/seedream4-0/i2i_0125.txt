    "Question": "Q1: Does the area around the apples show any unnatural textures or artifacts after adding the text 'Fresh' at the bottom left and 'Sweet' at the top right?",
    "explanation": "The area around the apples in Image B, particularly near the text placements, shows no visible signs of unnatural textures or digital artifacts. The wooden surface beneath the apples maintains consistent grain patterns and lighting, with no pixelation, blurring, or distortion that would suggest manipulation interference. The addition of the text appears to be overlaid cleanly without altering the underlying texture of the wood or the shadows cast by the apples. This suggests that the text was added using a non-destructive method, such as layering with transparency, preserving the original image quality. Based on visual inspection and common image editing practices, if artifacts were present, they would likely appear as jagged edges, color bleeding, or inconsistent lighting—none of which are observed here.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the fonts for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' appear visually consistent with the background image, avoiding any visual disruption or inconsistency?",
    "explanation": "The fonts used for 'Fresh' and 'Sweet' are clean, sans-serif, and white with a subtle drop shadow or slight opacity, which helps them blend into the image without overwhelming it. The placement of the text is strategic: 'Fresh' at the bottom left and 'Sweet' at the top right balances the composition. The font size is proportionate to the image scale and does not dominate the scene. Moreover, the white color contrasts well against the darker background areas (like the shadowed parts of the table and wall), ensuring readability while maintaining harmony with the natural tones of the apples and wooden surface. There is no visual clash or distraction; instead, the text complements the image’s theme of freshness and sweetness. From a design perspective, this choice reflects good typographic integration with photographic content.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the shapes of the apples preserved without distortion after incorporating the text 'Fresh' at the bottom left and 'Sweet' at the top right?",
    "explanation": "The shapes of the apples remain intact and undistorted in Image B. The contours of both apples are smooth, symmetrical, and naturally rounded, consistent with real apples. The text overlays do not intersect with or alter the apple surfaces—there is no warping, stretching, or clipping that would indicate shape manipulation. The lighting and shadows on the apples continue to follow natural gradients, reinforcing their three-dimensional form. Since the text is placed outside the primary body of the apples (bottom left and top right), it does not interfere with the structural integrity of the fruit's depiction. This preservation aligns with standard image editing techniques where text is added externally to avoid object deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the alignment of the text 'Fresh' at the bottom left and 'Sweet' at the top right properly aligned so that it doesn't alter the apples' structure or visual balance?",
    "explanation": "The alignment of the text is well-executed. 'Fresh' is positioned in the lower-left corner, where there is ample negative space, and 'Sweet' is placed in the upper-right, creating a balanced diagonal composition. Neither piece of text overlaps the apples or intrudes into their spatial domain, thus preserving the central focus on the fruit. The alignment respects the natural flow of light and shadow in the image—'Sweet' is near the brighter window area, subtly reinforcing its association with brightness and flavor, while 'Fresh' anchors the bottom left, grounding the image. This layout enhances rather than disrupts the visual balance. There is no indication that the text has caused any forced repositioning or visual imbalance in the apples’ placement or appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the apples, including their speckles and light reflections, remained clear and undamaged after adding the text 'Fresh' and 'Sweet'?",
    "explanation": "The fine details of the apples—such as the small white speckles on the skin, the subtle gradient from red to yellow, and the glossy highlights indicating light reflection—are fully preserved in Image B. These features are clearly visible and unobscured by the text. The text is placed in regions away from the apples themselves, meaning the high-resolution detail of the fruit remains untouched. Additionally, the text appears to have been layered with transparency or anti-aliasing to prevent sharp edges from interfering with nearby elements. There is no evidence of blurring, masking, or overlay effects that would degrade the apple's texture. Therefore, the integrity of the apples’ surface details is maintained, consistent with professional image editing standards.",
    "answer": "Yes"
