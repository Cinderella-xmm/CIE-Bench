      "question": "Are the facial features of the scientist proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes such as elongated eyes, misaligned nose, or uneven lip contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scientist's facial features appear to be proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes. The eyes are not elongated, the nose is aligned correctly with the face, and the lips have even contours. This conclusion is drawn by observing the symmetry and natural proportions of the face in relation to common human facial anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lab coat exhibit natural fabric folds and subtle shading consistent with real-world draping, without appearing uniformly flat or lacking depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lab coat in Image B does not exhibit natural fabric folds or subtle shading consistent with real-world draping. Instead, it appears uniformly flat and lacks depth, which suggests a lack of realistic texture and shadowing that would typically be present on a real lab coat. This analysis is based on comparing the visual cues of the lab coat with expected characteristics of fabric in a three-dimensional space.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the pipette have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are the joints and knuckles positioned realistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the pipette in Image B has exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing. The joints and knuckles are positioned realistically, suggesting an anatomically correct representation of a human hand. This conclusion is reached by examining the hand's structure and comparing it to typical human hand anatomy.",

      "question": "Do the test tubes display uniform liquid levels and clear glass surfaces with coherent reflections and refractions, without visible texture distortions or broken geometric outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The test tubes in Image B display uniform liquid levels and clear glass surfaces with coherent reflections and refractions. There are no visible texture distortions or broken geometric outlines, indicating a realistic depiction of glassware. This assessment is made by analyzing the visual consistency and clarity of the test tubes in relation to how glass and liquids behave in reality.",

      "question": "Are the components of the microscope and adjacent control panel correctly aligned and proportionally scaled, with no misplaced parts or floating elements that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The components of the microscope and adjacent control panel in Image B are correctly aligned and proportionally scaled. There are no misplaced parts or floating elements that violate physical logic. This conclusion is derived from observing the structural integrity and alignment of the microscope and control panel, ensuring they conform to realistic scientific equipment design.",
