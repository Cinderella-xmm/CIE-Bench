      "question": "Does the table appear transformed into a tea box lid with consistent geometry and engraved leaf patterns that follow natural contours without warping or breaking the surface structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central wooden tray from the original scene has been replaced by a large, rectangular tea box lid. The surface of this lid features an engraved design of a teapot within a stylized leaf outline, along with additional leaf motifs on the side. The geometry of the lid appears consistent with the perspective of the room—its edges are straight and aligned with the floor mat's grid, suggesting a coherent 3D form. The engraved patterns follow smooth, natural contours typical of botanical illustrations and do not exhibit warping or structural breaks. The texture of the engraving is subtle and integrated into the material, resembling wood grain or embossed paper, which maintains the integrity of the surface. Given the absence of visual distortions and the alignment with the surrounding environment, it can be concluded that the transformation into a tea box lid is geometrically sound and visually plausible.",

      "question": "Are the replaced cups depicted with clear, detailed sustainable material textures (such as fibrous or layered patterns) that appear natural and integrated into the scene without visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual tea cups seen in Image A have been removed entirely and are not present in the scene. Instead, the focus is on the tea box lid and its decorative elements. There are no cups visible in Image B, so there are no replaced cups to evaluate for texture, material detail, or integration. Since the question assumes the presence of replaced cups, but none exist in the edited image, the premise does not hold. Therefore, based on the visual evidence, the answer must reflect that the condition described in the question cannot be met due to the absence of the objects in question.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the tag with the text \"Zen Autumn Tea\" clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the scene’s aesthetic, and seamlessly integrated with proper lighting and shadow alignment to avoid appearing pasted on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tag attached to the tea box lid in Image B displays the text 'Zen Autumn Tea' in a handwritten-style font. The text is clearly legible, with clean lettering and appropriate contrast against the white background of the tag. The style of the script aligns well with the traditional, serene aesthetic of the scene—evoking handcrafted, artisanal branding commonly associated with tea products. The tag is tied with a thin string, and its placement on the box is natural and balanced. Furthermore, the lighting on the tag matches the ambient light source from the window, casting soft shadows that suggest depth and physical presence. There are no signs of digital artifacts, sharp edges, or unnatural highlights that would indicate it was poorly superimposed. The overall integration is seamless, contributing to the authenticity of the composition.",

      "question": "Is the teapot reshaped into a leaf contour with smooth, continuous edges and natural-looking earthy textures that do not show distortion, clipping, or unnatural color gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teapot in Image B is not physically present as a standalone object; instead, it is depicted as part of an engraving on the tea box lid. Within this engraving, the teapot is stylized to fit inside the shape of a large leaf, with its form adapted to follow the leaf’s natural curvature. The edges of the teapot within the engraving are smooth and continuous, conforming to the organic shape of the leaf without sharp breaks or distortions. The texture applied to the teapot illustration mimics aged ceramic or earthenware, using earthy tones and subtle grain patterns that match the autumnal theme. There are no visible clipping artifacts, jagged lines, or unnatural color shifts. The artistic representation respects both the silhouette of a teapot and the organic form of a leaf, achieving a harmonious blend. While it is not a 3D object but a 2D illustration, it is rendered with high fidelity and consistency in style.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all edited elements (tea box lid, sustainable cups, brand tag, leaf-shaped teapot) align with the original lighting direction and cast consistent shadows, maintaining spatial harmony and depth without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the scene originates from the left-side shoji screen, casting warm, diffused light across the room and creating soft shadows to the right of objects. In Image B, the tea box lid casts a shadow consistent with this directional lighting—slightly angled to the right and slightly behind, indicating correct depth and position relative to the light source. The tag attached to the box also shows a subtle shadow beneath it, reinforcing its physical presence. The engraved teapot and leaf design on the lid are flat illustrations and do not cast shadows, which is acceptable since they are part of the surface. However, the 'sustainable cups' mentioned in the query are not present in Image B—there are no cups at all. This omission means one of the listed edited elements does not exist, making full alignment impossible. Despite this, the visible elements (box lid, tag) are well-integrated with lighting and shadow. However, because the question requires evaluation of all listed elements, and one key component (cups) is missing or absent, the overall spatial harmony cannot be fully confirmed. Thus, while most elements are well-aligned, the absence of the cups introduces a discrepancy in the expected composition.",
