      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the brass gears and copper funnels added to the building's exterior consistent in material appearance, showing realistic metallic reflections and surface details without artificial or pixelated textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass gears and copper funnels on the building's exterior exhibit a consistent material appearance with realistic metallic reflections and surface details. The lighting highlights the metallic sheen, and there are no visible pixelated textures or artificial artifacts that would suggest otherwise. The analysis is based on observing the smooth gradients and reflective properties typical of polished metal surfaces.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the clock faces on the observatory dome maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape, with no visible warping or bending of clock numerals or hands?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock faces on the observatory dome appear to maintain correct proportions and alignment with the spherical shape. There is no visible warping or bending of the clock numerals or hands; they seem to be properly integrated into the dome's curvature. This conclusion is drawn from examining the uniformity and clarity of the clock features against the dome's surface.",

      "question": "Does the steam emanating from the structure appear volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam emanating from the structure appears volumetric and translucent, rising naturally from vents without abrupt edges or unnatural clustering. It blends smoothly with the background, suggesting a realistic depiction of steam behavior in air. The analysis considers the softness and diffusion of the steam as it rises, which aligns with real-world observations of steam dynamics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the ornamental metal details on the observatory dome continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornamental metal details on the observatory dome are continuous and properly scaled, with no gaps, overlapping errors, or jagged edges suggesting incomplete rendering. Each element, such as gears and pipes, connects seamlessly with adjacent parts, maintaining a cohesive design. The reasoning involves assessing the uniformity and integration of these elements within the overall structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the reflection of the building in the water a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflection of the building in the water is a symmetrical and undistorted mirror image of the edited structure, including all added steampunk elements such as gears, clock faces, and steam vents. The reflection accurately replicates the details of the building above, showing consistency in proportions and placement. This assessment is based on comparing the reflected image with the actual structure, ensuring that all elements are mirrored correctly.",
