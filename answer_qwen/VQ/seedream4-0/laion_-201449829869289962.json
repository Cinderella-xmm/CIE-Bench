      "question": "Does the dome glass case show smooth transparency with realistic light interaction and no visible stitching or warping around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome glass case in Image B appears highly polished and transparent, with subtle reflections and refractions that mimic real glass behavior. Light interacts naturally with the surface—there are soft highlights and faint distortions consistent with how light bends through curved glass. The edges of the dome are smooth, without any visible seams, jagged lines, or digital artifacts that would suggest stitching or poor rendering. The curvature is consistent, and there is no warping or unnatural stretching of the background elements behind the dome. This suggests a high-quality 3D rendering where physical properties of glass were simulated accurately. Based on visual cues and knowledge of photorealistic rendering techniques, this dome exhibits realistic optical behavior.",

      "question": "Are the dimensions of the church tower, roof, and adjacent buildings proportionally consistent with one another as if reduced uniformly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church tower, main building, and surrounding structures appear to be scaled down uniformly, maintaining their relative proportions. The height of the tower compared to the width of the church body remains consistent with typical architectural scaling. Adjacent buildings, including smaller houses, maintain proportional relationships in height and footprint relative to the main church. There is no evident distortion such as elongation or compression, which could occur if parts were resized independently. The overall scene maintains a coherent sense of scale, suggesting that the entire structure was uniformly downsized for inclusion in the diorama. This uniformity supports the idea of a carefully modeled miniature version of the original scene.",

      "question": "Are the newly added small houses aligned with the original architectural style and do they have correctly shaped roofs, windows, and textures without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small houses added in the diorama exhibit architectural features consistent with the Alpine style seen in the original church and surrounding buildings—such as sloped tiled roofs, wooden shutters, and stucco walls. Their roof shapes are symmetrical and appropriately angled for snow runoff, typical of mountainous regions. Windows are evenly spaced and proportionate, with no signs of warping or texture misalignment. Textures appear seamless and natural, without pixelation or tiling artifacts. These details indicate that the new structures were designed with attention to stylistic continuity and realism, matching the aesthetic of the region depicted. Given the consistency in design language, it's clear these additions were crafted to harmonize with the original architecture.",

      "question": "Does the copper roof on the church tower display realistic texture variations, oxidation effects, and lighting response consistent with real copper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The copper roof on the church tower in Image B has a rich, warm metallic sheen with subtle gradients that suggest depth and surface variation. It shows darker areas near the base and lighter highlights at the top, consistent with how light reflects off curved metal surfaces. There are slight mottled patterns resembling patina or oxidation, which develop over time on copper. These effects contribute to a realistic appearance, mimicking the natural aging process of copper exposed to weather. The way shadows fall across the dome and the reflection of ambient light further support authenticity. While not every microscopic detail may be present, the overall visual impression aligns with known characteristics of aged copper roofing.",

      "question": "Is the mist along the distant mountains smoothly diffused with gradual opacity changes and no abrupt edges or blocky patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mist in the background of Image B is rendered with soft, flowing transitions between dense and translucent areas. It wraps around mountain ridges naturally, creating a sense of depth and atmospheric perspective. There are no sharp boundaries or pixelated edges; instead, the fog blends seamlessly into the sky and terrain. The opacity varies gradually, becoming denser in valleys and thinner at higher elevations, which matches real-world meteorological behavior. This smooth diffusion indicates advanced rendering techniques like volumetric fog simulation, which avoids artificial-looking blocks or banding often seen in lower-quality digital art.",

      "question": "Is the gold pedestal positioned directly under the base of the diorama and does it have a solid, grounded appearance with no floating or misaligned parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold pedestal in Image B is clearly centered beneath the circular base of the glass dome, providing stable support. Its position aligns perfectly with the center of mass of the diorama, and there is no indication of floating or offset placement. The base of the dome rests firmly on the platform, and the shadow cast below reinforces the grounded appearance. The pedestal itself has a polished, reflective surface with a tapered design that tapers down to a wider foot, enhancing stability. No gaps or misalignments are visible, suggesting careful modeling and rendering to ensure physical plausibility.",

      "question": "Do the terraced vineyards show consistent spacing and natural curvature without visible grid lines or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terraced vineyards in Image B follow a natural, undulating pattern that conforms to the slope of the hillside. The rows are evenly spaced and curve gently, reflecting real agricultural practices in hilly terrain. There are no visible grid lines, repetitive patterns, or pixelation that would suggest digital artifacts. The vegetation appears lush and continuous, with soft transitions between terraces. The shading and lighting enhance the three-dimensional feel, making the terraces look organically formed rather than artificially generated. This level of detail suggests high-resolution modeling and attention to environmental realism.",
