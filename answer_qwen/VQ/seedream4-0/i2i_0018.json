      "question": "Does the exaggerated and elongated clock tower retain its structural consistency and does it appear logically consistent with the original proportions of the clock tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clock tower is depicted in a highly stylized and exaggerated manner. The structure is elongated significantly compared to typical clock towers, which usually have more balanced proportions between height and width. The elongation creates an unrealistic appearance as it deviates from common architectural norms where structures need to maintain certain proportions for stability and aesthetic appeal. This suggests that the proportions are not logically consistent with real-world clock towers.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colorful geometric flowerbed rings natural in appearance, lacking any unnatural textures or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowerbed rings in Image B are composed of bright, geometric shapes and patterns, which are clearly artificial and stylized. They lack the organic texture and detailed appearance of real flowers. This design choice makes them unnatural in appearance, as they prioritize artistic abstraction over realistic representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the transition from the chibi-style illustration elements to the glossy enamel coloring look smooth and free of visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image appears to be a digital rendering designed to mimic the look of a glossy enamel badge. The transition between the chibi-style illustration and the glossy finish seems seamless, without noticeable artifacts such as pixelation or distortion. The edges are clean, and the colors blend well, suggesting a smooth transition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the clock tower and flowerbed badge maintain a vertical, metallic structure consistent with a city souvenir badge, without any structural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the badge maintains a vertical orientation, the structure of the clock tower is heavily distorted through exaggeration and elongation, which is inconsistent with typical souvenir badges that aim to represent landmarks accurately. The badge's purpose is likely decorative rather than a precise representation.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the chibi-style transformation of the clock tower and flowerbed retain a natural and authentic appearance, avoiding any obvious distortions or unrealistic elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style transformation introduces significant distortions and unrealistic elements, such as the exaggerated proportions of the clock tower and the abstract, geometric flowerbed. These features do not align with a natural or authentic appearance but instead emphasize a playful and stylized aesthetic.",
