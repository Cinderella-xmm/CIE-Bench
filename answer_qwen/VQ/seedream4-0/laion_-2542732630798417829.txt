    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and smile drawn on the glass surface without causing visible distortion or blocking of the internal filament structure?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon-style light bulb has a face drawn directly onto its glass surface. The eyes and smile are stylized and appear as simple white outlines with black pupils and a curved line for the mouth. These features are positioned on the front-facing side of the bulb and are drawn in such a way that they do not obscure the intricate filament structure inside. The filament remains clearly visible through the glass, indicating that the facial features are either translucent or applied in a manner that does not block light or distort the internal components. This is consistent with common artistic techniques used in cartoons where faces are added to objects without physically interfering with their internal mechanics. There is no visible warping or shadowing caused by the drawing, suggesting it was digitally layered without altering the transparency or clarity of the glass.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms extend from the bulb body in a way that follows the curvature of the glass and metal cage without appearing detached or geometrically broken?",
    "explanation": "The arms of the animated light bulb in Image B originate from the sides of the glass bulb, just above the base, and extend outward in a smooth, curved fashion. They follow the natural contour of the bulb’s shape, which is teardrop-like and symmetrical. The arms connect seamlessly to the bulb's body and are proportionally scaled to match the size of the bulb. Importantly, the arms do not intersect with the metal cage in a way that suggests physical impossibility—instead, they appear to pass through or emerge from behind the cage, maintaining visual continuity. While the cage itself is solid, the cartoon style allows for artistic liberty where limbs can be depicted as extending from within or behind structures without violating real-world physics. The overall design preserves spatial logic for animation purposes, making the arms appear integrated rather than detached or geometrically broken.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the metal cage fully intact with all loops connected and symmetrically arranged around the bulb, showing no missing or distorted sections?",
    "explanation": "The metal cage surrounding the light bulb in Image B is designed in a classic industrial style, composed of multiple curved metal rods forming a protective lattice. Upon close inspection, the cage appears complete and symmetrical, with each loop properly aligned and connected at both top and bottom junctions. The structure maintains uniform spacing between the rods, and there are no visible gaps, breaks, or misalignments. Even though the image is stylized and part of a comic panel, the cage retains structural integrity consistent with real-world designs. The symmetry is preserved across both horizontal and vertical axes, reinforcing the impression of a well-crafted, unbroken frame. No section appears stretched, compressed, or missing, which would otherwise suggest digital distortion or incomplete rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the background elements cast shadows and reflect light in a manner consistent with the direction and intensity of the bulb’s glow?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the light bulb emits a warm, yellow-orange glow that illuminates the surrounding environment. In the upper panel, the lab setting includes various equipment such as flasks, machines, and gears. These objects cast soft shadows toward the back and left side, indicating that the primary light source (the bulb) is positioned centrally and facing forward. The lighting on surfaces like the workbench and machinery shows subtle highlights consistent with a directional light source. In the lower panel, the intense red and orange background suggests a dramatic increase in brightness, with spark effects and radiating lines emphasizing the bulb’s energy. However, the reflections and shadows on nearby objects (e.g., the machine on the right) are not fully coherent with the bulb’s position—some areas are over-lit while others remain dark despite proximity. Additionally, the absence of realistic specular reflections or gradient falloff suggests that lighting is more stylized than physically accurate. Therefore, while the general illumination theme aligns with the bulb’s glow, the consistency of shadows and reflections is compromised by the exaggerated comic art style.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the colors applied evenly across all surfaces (glass, metal, background) without visible banding, oversaturation, or texture degradation?",
    "explanation": "The color application in Image B is generally vibrant and consistent with a comic book aesthetic. The glass of the bulb has a translucent yellow-orange tint that matches the filament’s glow, with no visible banding or pixelation. The metal cage exhibits a dark metallic finish with subtle shading to suggest depth, but there are no signs of texture degradation or unnatural gradients. The background elements—such as the lab equipment and walls—are rendered with smooth gradients and solid fills typical of vector-based illustrations. However, in the lower panel, the fiery red-orange backdrop contains halftone dot patterns and sharp transitions that may be interpreted as stylized noise rather than actual artifacts. These are intentional stylistic choices in comic art, not indicators of poor rendering. Overall, there is no evidence of oversaturation (e.g., blown-out highlights) or visible banding (striped color artifacts), especially when considering the medium. Thus, the colors are applied evenly within the context of the artwork’s intended style.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the text box and speech bubble positioned so that they do not overlap with the bulb’s internal structure or metal cage, and are they clearly readable?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the speech bubbles are placed strategically to avoid overlapping with critical parts of the bulb. The top speech bubble is located to the upper right of the bulb, floating away from the metal cage and glass surface, ensuring no interference with the bulb’s structure. Similarly, the lower speech bubble is positioned to the right of the running bulb character, avoiding any contact with the glass or cage. Both bubbles are large enough and use bold, legible font with high contrast against their backgrounds (light beige with red text), making them easily readable. The placement respects the spatial layout of the scene and does not obstruct key visual elements like the filament or cage. This demonstrates careful composition typical of comic book design, where text must be readable without disrupting the main subject.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are the arms positioned in a way that follows natural joint angles and does not intersect with the bulb’s glass or metal cage in an impossible manner?",
    "explanation": "The arms of the animated light bulb in Image B are attached near the middle of the bulb’s body and bend at what appear to be elbow joints. The positioning of the arms—especially in the lower panel where one arm is raised and sparking—is anatomically plausible for a cartoon character. The elbows are bent naturally, and the hands are placed in a dynamic pose that conveys motion. Crucially, the arms do not penetrate the glass or metal cage; instead, they seem to emerge from behind the cage, which is a common artistic convention in animation to allow characters to interact with enclosed objects without violating physical laws. Although the cage is solid, the perspective and layering suggest that the arms are outside the cage or passing through it invisibly, which is acceptable within the context of stylized illustration. There is no intersection that defies spatial logic, and the joint angles are consistent with typical human-like limb movement.",
    "answer": "Yes"
