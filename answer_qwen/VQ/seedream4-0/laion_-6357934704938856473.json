      "question": "Are the brushed metal and matte finishes applied consistently across the robot’s body without visible texture artifacts or inconsistent sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's surface exhibits a combination of brushed metal and matte finishes. The brushed metal effect is most prominent on the base and certain armor panels, particularly around the legs and lower torso, where fine linear textures simulate metal grain. These areas maintain consistent directional brush strokes and reflect light uniformly, suggesting a high-quality application. The matte sections, primarily on the upper body and head, show no specular highlights, indicating a non-reflective finish that contrasts with the metallic parts. There are no visible texture seams, pixelation, or unnatural transitions between materials. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of 3D rendering standards, such consistency in material application—especially in professional CG work from design data—is indicative of careful texturing. No artifacts like banding, muddiness, or inconsistent gloss are present. Therefore, the finishes appear to be applied uniformly.",

      "question": "Is the hexagonal box fully enclosed around the robot with clean edges, proper proportions, and a clearly legible \"MECHA VANGUARD\" label without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hexagonal display base in Image B appears structurally sound, with sharp, well-defined edges and symmetrical geometry. It encloses the robot securely, with cutouts precisely matching the robot's limbs and weapon placement. The proportions align logically with the scale of the robot, maintaining a realistic relationship between the figure and its platform. The 'MECHA VANGUARD' label is positioned on the front face of the base, rendered in a clean, sans-serif font with clear contrast against the metallic background. There is no visible warping, blurring, or perspective distortion in the text, and it remains legible even at a slight angle. Given the context of promotional CGI for a model kit (as indicated by the copyright and design notes), such attention to detail in branding and presentation is expected. Thus, the base meets all criteria for structural integrity and labeling clarity.",

      "question": "Are the engraved details on the armor plates and weapon surfaces clear and non-blurry, and do the joint areas (elbows, knees) show no signs of geometric distortion or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the armor plates exhibit fine engraved lines, panel lines, and mechanical detailing—such as rivets, hinges, and access ports—that are sharp and well-defined. These features are consistent with high-resolution 3D modeling and rendering practices. The weapons, including the rifle and sword, also feature precise engravings and markings (e.g., serial numbers, logos) that remain crisp and readable. Joint areas, particularly the elbows and knees, show articulated mechanical structures with correct topology—no overlapping polygons, missing geometry, or mesh deformation. The articulation points have defined pivot mechanisms and connecting rods, which are typical in mecha designs. This level of fidelity suggests a robust 3D model with properly subdivided meshes. There is no evidence of aliasing, blur, or clipping, indicating that the render quality is high and the model was carefully constructed.",

      "question": "Does the cityscape background extend behind the robot without clipping through its limbs or body, and does it match the lighting direction and scale of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B depicts a futuristic cityscape with tall skyscrapers, neon lights, and dynamic water splashes. The environment is projected onto a curved screen behind the robot, creating an immersive setting. Crucially, the background elements do not intersect or clip through any part of the robot’s body or limbs. The robot is clearly in the foreground, with depth separation maintained throughout. The lighting in the scene—particularly the ambient glow and reflections on the robot—matches the direction of the light sources in the background (e.g., blue and white highlights from the sky and buildings). Additionally, the scale of the cityscape is consistent with the size of the robot, suggesting it is meant to represent a large-scale mecha in an urban environment. The use of a curved backdrop avoids perspective distortion and enhances realism. This integration of background and subject adheres to standard cinematic composition principles in product visualization.",

      "question": "Are the robot’s limbs, weapons, and armor pieces correctly aligned and positioned without overlapping or floating elements that violate spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robot's limbs are posed dynamically, with the right arm raised holding a rifle and the left arm extended downward gripping a sword. All joints—shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees—are articulated naturally, with no visible gaps or misalignments. The weapons are firmly attached to the hands, and their positioning respects anatomical and mechanical plausibility. Armor pieces, such as shoulder pauldrons and thigh guards, fit seamlessly into the overall structure without floating or clipping. Notably, the backpack-mounted wing-like component and the thrusters on the legs are anchored correctly and do not appear detached or misplaced. The spatial relationships between components are coherent, and there are no instances of objects passing through each other or appearing suspended in mid-air. This alignment reflects accurate rigging and posing in 3D space, consistent with professional mecha design standards.",
