      "question": "Do the bananas retain a natural curvature and texture, avoiding any obvious distortion or unnatural shapes after being redrawn?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bananas are depicted with a smooth and consistent curvature that aligns with their natural shape. The texture is simplified but still conveys the typical yellow peel of bananas. There are no obvious distortions or unnatural shapes present in the bananas. The analysis is based on visual cues such as the outline and shading which suggest a natural form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the wooden base and metal stand preserve their material properties and structural coherence, without introducing unnatural textures or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base and metal stand in Image B maintain their structural coherence with clean lines and appropriate geometric shapes. The material properties are stylized but recognizable, with the wood appearing flat yet distinct from the metallic sheen of the stand. This assessment is made by observing the consistency in design and the logical representation of materials.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines around the bananas and stand clear and consistent, contributing to the chibi-style aesthetic without being overly thick or uneven?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold outlines around the bananas and stand in Image B are clear and consistent, contributing to a chibi-style aesthetic. They are neither overly thick nor uneven, providing a uniform look that enhances the cartoonish appearance. This conclusion is drawn from examining the uniformity and clarity of the outlines against the background and other elements.",

      "question": "Does the green hill background integrate seamlessly with the foreground elements, maintaining proportional logic and visual coherence without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green hill background in Image B integrates well with the foreground elements. It maintains proportional logic and visual coherence, complementing the scene without appearing out of place. The background's simplicity ensures it does not clash with the main subject, which is a common practice in cartoon illustrations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details on the bananas, such as the tips and edges, been preserved in the cartoon redraw, avoiding any loss or distortion that affects the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details on the bananas, such as the tips and edges, have been preserved in the cartoon redraw of Image B. While the style is simplified, the essential features like the banana ends and overall shape are accurately represented, avoiding any significant loss or distortion that would affect the natural appearance. This is assessed by comparing these details with what one would expect from a natural banana depiction.",
