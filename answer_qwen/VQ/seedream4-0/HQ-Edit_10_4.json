      "question": "Does the facial area exhibit a consistent dark wood texture with natural grain patterns, maintaining accurate facial proportions and avoiding distortions such as warped features or inconsistent surface depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial area is rendered with a highly detailed dark wood texture that mimics the appearance of carved wood. The grain patterns are visible and follow natural wood flow directions, particularly along the forehead, cheeks, and jawline, suggesting a deliberate artistic choice to emulate real wood carving. The facial proportions appear balanced and anatomically accurate—eyes, nose, and lips are symmetrically placed and proportionate to each other, which is consistent with traditional sculptural standards. There is no visible warping or distortion; features like the eyelids and lips maintain smooth curvature without unnatural sharpness or flattening. The surface depth is consistent, with subtle shading indicating three-dimensionality, especially around the cheekbones and chin. This suggests that the artist or rendering process preserved realistic spatial relationships. Combined with world knowledge of wooden sculpture techniques (e.g., African tribal carvings), this level of detail and proportionality supports the conclusion that the facial area is accurately represented as a carved wooden figure.",

      "question": "Are the patterns on the clothing rendered as deeply incised carvings with visible relief depth, and do they preserve the original arrangement of colors and shapes without blurring or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clothing in Image B displays intricate patterns that are clearly modeled as carved reliefs. The lines and geometric designs—such as vertical stripes, zigzags, and rectangular motifs—are deeply etched into the wooden surface, creating a sense of physical depth through shadowing and contour variation. These patterns are not flat but show raised and recessed areas, consistent with hand-carved or machine-carved wood art. The coloration remains vibrant and follows the same layout seen in traditional African textiles, such as Kente or Adinkra patterns. However, due to the medium being wood, the 'colors' appear painted onto the carved surface rather than woven fabric. Despite this, the alignment of shapes is precise, with no visible blurring or misalignment. Each pattern element maintains its intended position and symmetry, indicating careful digital or physical craftsmanship. Based on knowledge of both African art and digital sculpting, this representation aligns well with how such garments would be interpreted in a wooden sculpture format.",

      "question": "Are the beads on the crown and earrings clearly defined with vibrant, non-blended colors, appearing as painted details on the wooden surface rather than merged or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beads on the crown and earrings in Image B are distinctly rendered as individual elements with sharp edges and vivid colors—red, blue, yellow, green, and orange—arranged in repeating sequences. These colors do not bleed into one another, indicating high-resolution rendering or painting precision. The beads appear to be applied as surface-level paint details rather than 3D objects, consistent with how decorative elements are often added to wooden sculptures. Their placement follows a logical pattern, matching traditional African beadwork aesthetics. There is no evidence of texture blending or distortion; each bead retains its shape and hue. The contrast between the dark wood background and the bright colors enhances their clarity. Given that real wooden carvings sometimes feature painted embellishments, this depiction is plausible and stylistically coherent. Therefore, the beads are clearly defined and properly rendered as painted details.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of low-relief carved plant forms that maintain spatial depth and botanical structure, without flattening or losing the sense of layered vegetation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of stylized plant forms—leaves, fronds, and tree silhouettes—that are carved in low relief. These elements are integrated into the same wooden texture as the figure, suggesting they are part of a single sculptural piece. The depth is maintained through subtle shading and varying thicknesses of the carved surfaces, giving a sense of layering. For example, some leaves appear closer to the viewer while others recede, creating a shallow but perceptible spatial hierarchy. The botanical structures are recognizable—palm-like fronds, ferns, and branching trees—indicating intentional design based on natural forms. Although the relief is low, there is no flattening; the contours remain distinct and contribute to a cohesive jungle-like environment. This technique mirrors traditional African wooden panel carvings where background scenes are intricately detailed yet subordinate to the main subject. Thus, the background preserves both depth and botanical accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the entire sculpture surface display a consistent polished finish with no visible rendering artifacts, such as edge halos, texture repetition, or missing fine details in the hair, beads, or clothing carvings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the sculpture in Image B exhibits a uniform, glossy finish that reflects light smoothly, indicative of a polished wooden texture. There are no visible edge halos (a common artifact in digital rendering when transparency or alpha channels are poorly handled), nor any signs of texture tiling or repetition. The fine details—such as individual strands in the coiled hair, the tiny beads in the headpiece, and the intricate line work on the clothing—are sharply defined and consistently rendered across the entire figure. The hair, though stylized, shows clear separation between curls and includes embedded beads with precise placement. The transition between different parts of the sculpture (face, neck, shoulders) is seamless, with no abrupt changes in texture or resolution. This level of consistency suggests either high-quality digital sculpting or a photograph of a finely crafted physical object. In both cases, the absence of artifacts supports a clean, professional execution.",
