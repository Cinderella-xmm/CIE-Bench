    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed object maintain a tall, rectangular silhouette with smooth, continuous vertical sides and no visible warping or collapsed edges?",
    "explanation": "The object in Image B is a tall, rectangular vessel with straight, vertical sides that appear consistent and uniform from top to bottom. The glass material forms clean, uninterrupted edges, and there are no signs of distortion, bending, or collapse in the structure. The overall silhouette is symmetrical and maintains a rigid, box-like shape typical of a well-crafted container. This aligns with the description of a tall, rectangular form with smooth, continuous sides. Based on visual inspection and common design principles for such objects (e.g., soap dispensers), this shape is both structurally sound and aesthetically intended to be pristine. There is no indication of warping or edge failure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the retractable handle replaced by a metallic spray nozzle that appears seamlessly attached to the top of the vessel, with no visible seams or material discontinuities?",
    "explanation": "The top of the object in Image B features a metallic pump dispenser, not a spray nozzle. A spray nozzle typically has a trigger mechanism and a misting tip, whereas this is a standard liquid-dispensing pump with a lever arm and cylindrical body. It is made of polished metal and is securely mounted at the top of the vessel. While it is attached smoothly and without obvious gaps, it is not a spray nozzle but rather a pump dispenser. Therefore, the replacement is not a spray nozzle as stated in the question. The absence of visible seams suggests high-quality integration, but the functional component does not match the described 'spray nozzle'.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the fabric panels replaced with translucent purple-tinted glass that shows uniform translucency and clearly defined embossed linear patterns matching the original seam locations?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the surface of the object is made of translucent purple-tinted glass, which exhibits uniform translucency throughout. The glass features a grid-like pattern of raised lines forming square sections, resembling a panelled design. These embossed linear patterns are evenly spaced and geometrically precise, suggesting intentional design. While the original suitcase (Image A) had stitched fabric panels with visible seams, the glass version mimics those seam locations through the embossed lines. This transformation preserves the structural layout of the original while replacing the material. The clarity and consistency of the patterns indicate a deliberate replication of the original's segmentation in a new medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the logo positioned near the top center of the front face and rendered as a clean, subtle etching on the glass surface without any visible digital artifacts or blurring?",
    "explanation": "The logo on the front face of the object in Image B is located near the top center, just below the pump mechanism. It consists of an elegant cursive 'C' with a small subscript '2', etched into the glass. The etching is subtle and integrated into the surface, appearing smooth and clear without pixelation, jagged edges, or blurring. The craftsmanship suggests a high-resolution engraving process, likely laser-etched, which produces clean results. There are no visible digital artifacts such as noise or distortion, indicating a professional finish. Given the nature of glass etching and the quality of the image, the logo appears to be accurately rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the four wheels replaced with identical decorative caps at each corner of the base, appearing as solid, polished elements without exposed mechanical parts or asymmetry?",
    "explanation": "At the base of the object in Image B, there are four small, round, translucent purple caps positioned at each corner. These caps resemble ornamental feet or stoppers and are identical in shape, size, and finish. They are solid and polished, with no visible mechanical components such as axles or bearings. Their placement is symmetrical, and they serve a purely aesthetic function, contrasting with the functional wheels seen in Image A. The absence of moving parts or exposed mechanisms confirms their role as decorative elements. This transformation replaces the utilitarian wheels with static, stylistic supports, maintaining symmetry and visual harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"
