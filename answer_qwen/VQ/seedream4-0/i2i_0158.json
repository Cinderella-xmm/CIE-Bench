      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three views of the car (front, side, and rear) are presented in a stacked format against a plain white background. Each view is clearly separated and individually rendered with high fidelity. The transitions between the views are not physical or spatial but rather visual separations in layout. There are no visible seams, distortions, or artifacts at the edges of each image segment. The car's design elements—such as the grille, headlights, wheels, and taillights—are consistent across views, suggesting that these images were likely generated from a 3D model or carefully composited renders. Since there is no blending or overlap between the views, and each one is cleanly isolated, the 'transition' between them is purely conceptual. Given that the individual views are sharp, coherent, and lack any visible digital anomalies, the overall presentation appears smooth and artifact-free.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the car parts consistent and logical across the three views without showing any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the three views in Image B, we observe that the car's proportions remain consistent across the front, side, and rear perspectives. In the front view, the grille, headlights, and bumper align symmetrically and proportionally with the body. The side view shows a balanced profile with correct wheel placement, door length, and roofline curvature, typical of a Ford Mustang. The rear view displays properly aligned taillights, trunk, and exhaust system. The angles of the car’s surfaces—such as the slope of the hood, the curve of the fenders, and the position of the wheels—match expected automotive design principles. There is no evidence of stretching, squashing, or misalignment that would suggest distortion. These views appear to be derived from a single 3D model, which inherently maintains consistent proportions across different angles. Thus, the car parts are logically proportioned and correctly angled.",

      "question": "Does the car's surface texture and material properties, like reflections and shine, appear uniform and realistic across all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red paint finish on the Mustang in Image B exhibits a glossy, reflective surface in all three views. The reflections on the hood, doors, and roof are consistent with a polished metallic paint, showing subtle highlights and ambient light interaction. The lighting appears directional, creating specular highlights that follow the curvature of the car’s body. In the front view, the reflection on the hood mirrors the light source above; in the side view, the reflections along the side panels are smooth and continuous; and in the rear view, the taillight reflections and trunk surface maintain this consistency. There are no abrupt changes in texture, such as matte patches or overly shiny spots, nor are there inconsistencies in gloss level across views. The material properties are uniformly applied, suggesting a professional rendering process. This uniformity supports the realism of the car’s surface across all views.",

      "question": "Are the lighting and shadow effects consistent and correctly aligned across all three views of the car?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each view of the car features soft shadows beneath it, indicating a light source positioned above and slightly in front of the vehicle. The shadows are cast directly below the car in all three views, with minimal variation in shape or intensity, suggesting a consistent overhead lighting setup. However, the direction of the light appears slightly inconsistent when comparing the front and rear views: the front view shows bright highlights on the upper part of the hood and windshield, while the rear view has similar highlights on the trunk lid and roof, but the angle of incidence seems slightly off for a single light source. Moreover, the side view shows a shadow that is more elongated than in the other views, possibly due to slight differences in camera angle or rendering settings. While the shadows are present and plausible, their alignment and direction do not perfectly match across all views, hinting at minor discrepancies in lighting simulation. Therefore, the lighting and shadow effects are mostly consistent but not perfectly aligned.",

      "question": "Does the background seamlessly integrate with the car without introducing any jarring inconsistencies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the car against a plain white background in all three views. The background is uniform and devoid of texture, objects, or environmental elements. The car is cleanly cut out, with no visible edges, halos, or pixelation around its perimeter. This suggests a professional masking or alpha channel extraction process. The absence of shadows or environmental context means there is no integration to evaluate in terms of realism or continuity with a scene. However, since the background is intentionally neutral and consistent across all views, it does not introduce any jarring inconsistencies. The clean separation between the car and the background ensures a seamless presentation within the context of a studio-style render. Therefore, despite the artificial nature of the background, it integrates smoothly with the car without artifacts.",
