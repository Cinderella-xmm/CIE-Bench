    "Question": "Q1: Do the chibi-style 3D characters retain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortions in their facial features and body shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the characters inside the snow globe are stylized in a chibi (super-deformed) art style, which is characterized by exaggerated features such as large heads, small bodies, and simplified facial expressions. While these proportions are intentionally cartoonish and not anatomically accurate, they are consistent with the aesthetic of chibi design. The facial features—such as large eyes, small noses, and simple mouths—are typical of this style and do not exhibit unnatural distortions within the context of their artistic genre. Their body shapes, though simplified, maintain recognizable human forms with limbs and torsos proportioned to fit the chibi aesthetic. Therefore, while not 'natural' in a realistic sense, they are coherent and stylistically appropriate without visual anomalies.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the snow globe, including its base and the table it rests on, integrate naturally with the living room setting without visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe in Image B is placed on a wooden surface that appears to be a coffee table or side table in a warmly lit living room. The base of the globe is dark and matte, matching typical snow globe designs, and casts a soft shadow beneath it, suggesting proper lighting interaction. The reflection and refraction on the glass dome appear smooth and consistent with real-world physics. The surrounding environment—featuring furniture, warm tones, and ambient light—blends seamlessly with the globe, and there are no visible seams, clipping errors, or digital artifacts. The scale of the globe relative to the background elements is plausible, and the overall composition feels cohesive. This suggests a high level of integration between the object and its environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the miniature snowflakes and twinkling fairy lights inside the snow globe visually credible and free from unnatural textures or lighting anomalies?",
    "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, white snowflake patterns are evenly distributed across the inner surface of the glass dome, resembling etched or printed designs commonly found on decorative snow globes. These snowflakes are symmetrical and have clean edges, consistent with manufactured patterns rather than randomly falling snow. The fairy lights form a string that loops around the interior, emitting a soft, warm glow. The lights are rendered with subtle lens flare effects and gentle glows, contributing to a magical ambiance. There are no pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts in the lighting. The illumination appears diffuse and consistent with indoor lighting conditions, enhancing realism without introducing visual artifacts. Thus, both elements are visually credible within the context of a stylized decorative item.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the game controllers held by the chibi-style characters retain their original shape and texture, appearing natural and functional?",
    "explanation": "Each character in the snow globe holds a black game controller that closely resembles a standard dual-analog joystick, such as those used for PlayStation or Xbox consoles. Despite the chibi styling, the controllers maintain recognizable features: two analog sticks, directional buttons, and button layouts. The texture appears smooth and consistent with plastic materials, and the size is proportionally scaled to match the characters’ hands. While slightly simplified due to the cartoonish style, the controllers are clearly identifiable and functionally plausible. There are no distortions, missing parts, or inconsistent shading that would suggest malfunction or poor rendering. Hence, they appear natural and functional within the stylized context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the sunlight streaming through the glass create believable sparkles on the tabletop, contributing to the warm, inviting ambiance without causing unnatural glare or shadows?",
    "explanation": "Sunlight enters the scene from the right side, casting a soft golden glow across the tabletop and creating scattered sparkles that mimic light reflections off a glossy surface. These sparkles are rendered with varying sizes and brightness, simulating dust particles or micro-reflections, which adds depth and warmth to the scene. The lighting gradient transitions smoothly from bright to dim, and the shadows cast by the snow globe are soft and consistent with the direction of the light source. There are no harsh glares, overexposed areas, or artificial-looking highlights that would break immersion. The effect enhances the cozy, festive atmosphere without introducing visual inconsistencies. Therefore, the lighting is both believable and aesthetically pleasing.",
    "answer": "Yes"
