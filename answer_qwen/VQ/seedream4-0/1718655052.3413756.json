      "question": "Are the wood-carved hat and scarf clearly distinguishable from the original fabric textures, with consistent grain patterns and engraved details that follow natural wood structure without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hat and scarf are constructed from LEGO bricks designed to mimic wood. The hat features a brown band with a wood-grain texture and engraved patterns resembling traditional carvings, which are consistent across its surface. These engravings follow a logical, symmetrical design that aligns with typical decorative motifs found in hand-carved wooden items. The texture is not actual wood but a printed or textured plastic representation. However, the pattern is coherent and repeats in a way that mimics natural wood grain directionality, especially around the brim and top of the hat. The scarf also includes a similar wood-textured section with an engraved pattern and fringe made of small LEGO pieces, suggesting deliberate attention to detail. While not real wood, the visual cues (texture, engraving style, color gradient) are crafted to simulate wood realistically within the constraints of LEGO materials. There is no visible distortion or inconsistency in the grain or carving patterns. Therefore, the wood-like appearance is convincingly rendered despite being artificial.",

      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks form a continuous, anatomically plausible layer over the dog’s body without gaps, overlapping inconsistencies, or floating pieces that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B depicts a stylized dog composed entirely of interlocking bricks. Observing the structure, the bricks are arranged in a layered fashion that follows the general contours of a dog's body—head, torso, limbs, and tail. The placement appears intentional, with each brick connected to adjacent ones, forming a solid, cohesive figure. There are no visible gaps between major sections, and all parts seem physically supported by underlying structures. For example, the legs are built with vertical stacks of bricks that taper appropriately, and the torso connects seamlessly to the head and limbs. The arms and legs end in flat brick surfaces that suggest paws, maintaining structural integrity. While some areas, like the sides of the body, show slight geometric simplification due to LEGO construction limitations, there are no floating pieces or unattached elements. The overall assembly adheres to physical logic for a stable LEGO build. Thus, the construction is anatomically plausible within the medium of LEGO bricks.",

      "question": "Is the light-colored wooden tabletop background evenly lit and seamlessly integrated with the subject, without abrupt transitions or shadow mismatches that suggest poor compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a light-colored wooden surface that appears smooth and uniform in tone and texture. The lighting on the tabletop is soft and even, with subtle gradations that suggest ambient illumination from above. The shadows cast by the LEGO dog are soft-edged and fall naturally beneath it, consistent with the direction of light coming from slightly above and in front. There are no harsh lines or sudden changes in brightness at the edge of the subject, indicating a seamless integration between the dog and the surface. Additionally, the reflection and diffusion of light across the tabletop match the material properties of polished wood. The absence of digital artifacts such as haloing, clipping, or misaligned shadows suggests high-quality rendering or photography. Given these observations, the background is well-integrated and does not exhibit signs of poor compositing.",

      "question": "Are the ear flaps of the wood-carved hat properly shaped and positioned symmetrically on both sides of the dog’s head, without deformation or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ear flaps of the hat in Image B are attached to either side of the dog’s head. They are made of white LEGO bricks and have a rounded, downward-pointing shape typical of earmuffs or ear flaps on winter hats. Both flaps appear identical in size, shape, and orientation, indicating symmetry. Their positioning relative to the centerline of the dog’s face is balanced, with equal spacing from the central axis. There is no visible warping, stretching, or asymmetry in their form. The scale of the flaps is proportionate to the rest of the head, neither oversized nor undersized. Although the construction is blocky due to the nature of LEGO bricks, the overall design maintains a realistic impression of ear flaps. Therefore, based on visual inspection and common sense about symmetry and proportion in object design, the ear flaps are correctly formed and positioned.",

      "question": "Do the LEGO bricks exhibit consistent edge definition, proper shading, and logical placement across the dog’s body, avoiding blocky artifacts or color clumps that break visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B displays a high level of detail in terms of brick placement and visual coherence. Each brick has sharp, well-defined edges, and the shading varies subtly across surfaces to create depth and dimensionality, suggesting directional lighting. The colors transition logically—white for the fur, brown for the hat and scarf, black for the collar, and multicolored accents on the body—without random or clustered patches that would suggest poor design. While the inherent blockiness of LEGO bricks is present, it is expected and does not constitute an artifact; rather, it contributes to the stylized aesthetic. There are no isolated color blobs or misplaced bricks that disrupt the flow of the figure. The arrangement of bricks follows a logical pattern that respects the dog’s anatomy, such as curved lines for the face and segmented limbs. This careful construction ensures visual continuity despite the modular nature of the medium. Hence, the model avoids problematic artifacts and maintains a cohesive appearance.",
