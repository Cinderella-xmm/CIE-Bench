      "question": "Is the logo on the hammer handle seamlessly integrated with no visible texture mismatch, jagged edges, or unnatural color contrast compared to the surrounding wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the hammer in Image B, a small logo is visible near the junction of the wooden handle and the metal head. The logo appears as an embossed or engraved mark with a light-colored outline that matches the grain pattern of the wood. The texture of the logo blends well with the surrounding wood grain, showing no obvious jagged edges or abrupt transitions. The color contrast is minimal and consistent with natural variations in wood tone, suggesting it was either carved or printed with high fidelity. There are no signs of digital artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural sharpness. Based on visual cues and knowledge of woodworking tools, where logos or maker marks are often subtly branded into handles, this integration appears realistic and seamless.",

      "question": "Do the letters on the wood shavings follow the natural curvature and thickness of each shaving without appearing flattened, stretched, or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the word 'Debtrow' is superimposed over the workbench and wood shavings in a cursive script. However, the letters do not appear to be physically inscribed or carved into any individual shaving. Instead, they are rendered as a translucent overlay that passes through the shavings, creating an effect where parts of the text appear to float above or behind the physical objects. This creates a sense of depth inconsistency—since real lettering on shavings would need to conform to their curved, thin surfaces, but here the letters maintain uniform thickness and opacity regardless of the shaving's shape. Additionally, there is no shadowing or distortion that would suggest three-dimensional embedding. Therefore, the letters do not follow the natural curvature or thickness of the shavings and appear artificially layered rather than integrated.",

      "question": "Does the rustic banner at the top align with the lighting and shadows of the scene, and does its texture appear consistent with natural aged wood or fabric rather than digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The banner at the top of Image B has a parchment-like appearance with torn edges and a central emblem. Its texture resembles aged paper or cloth, with mottled tones and subtle imperfections that mimic natural aging. However, upon closer analysis, the banner casts no discernible shadow onto the pegboard below it, which contradicts the directional lighting evident in the rest of the scene (e.g., the shadows under the hammer and shavings). Furthermore, the banner’s edge appears uniformly sharp and lacks soft diffusion or interaction with ambient light, which would be expected if it were a physical object suspended in the environment. While the texture itself is convincing, the lack of shadow and inconsistent lighting suggests it was digitally added post-production without proper depth integration. Thus, despite its realistic texture, the banner fails to align with the scene’s lighting dynamics.",

      "question": "Are the copper accents on the pegboard evenly lit and shaded, matching the surrounding grayscale tones without creating unrealistic reflections or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pegboard in Image B features several metallic elements, including hooks and tool attachments. Among these, some components exhibit a warm, reddish-brown hue suggestive of copper. These copper elements are illuminated consistently with the overall lighting direction—from the upper left—casting soft shadows and reflecting highlights. However, the color shift from the dark gray pegboard to the copper is relatively abrupt in certain areas, particularly around the edges of the tools and fasteners. In real-world conditions, copper would show more gradual tonal transitions due to oxidation and ambient reflection. Moreover, the copper accents lack the typical specular highlights seen on polished metal, and instead appear somewhat flat and matte. This suggests that while the lighting direction is consistent, the material rendering is not fully realistic, resulting in unnatural color contrast and subdued reflectivity. Therefore, the copper accents do not integrate smoothly with the grayscale environment.",

      "question": "Is the business card positioned with correct perspective and scale relative to the tools and workbench, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the ambient light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The business card in Image B is placed against the pegboard, partially obscured by a metal clamp. Its size appears proportional to standard business cards (~3.5 x 2 inches), and its placement seems plausible within the context of a workshop setting. The card is angled slightly toward the viewer, maintaining consistent perspective with other objects like the hammer and chisels. Importantly, it casts a faint, soft shadow beneath it that aligns with the direction of light coming from the upper left—matching the shadows cast by the hammer and wood shavings. This indicates careful attention to lighting consistency. There are no signs of distortion, scaling errors, or unnatural positioning. Given that business cards are commonly left in workshops for branding or identification, this placement is both logical and visually coherent. The integration respects both scale and environmental lighting.",
