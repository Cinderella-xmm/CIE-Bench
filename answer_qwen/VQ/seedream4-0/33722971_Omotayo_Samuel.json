      "question": "Do the facial features on each suitcase align naturally with the object’s shape without distorting its geometry or creating unnatural protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features on each suitcase are designed to fit within the contours of the luggage. The eyes and mouths appear as if they are part of the suitcase's surface without causing any distortion or unnatural protrusions. This is achieved by placing the features in areas that naturally align with the suitcase's shape, such as near the edges or corners where they can be perceived as integrated elements rather than separate additions.",
