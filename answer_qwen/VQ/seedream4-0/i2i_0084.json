      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the dog and its blue mat appear consistent with the lighting of a snowy mountain setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog and its blue mat are situated in a snowy mountain setting. The lighting appears to be natural daylight with shadows cast by the tent and surrounding objects. The highlights on the dog's fur and the mat seem consistent with the bright, reflective surface of snow, which typically creates high contrast between light and shadow. The shadows under the dog and the mat align with the direction of sunlight, suggesting that the lighting is consistent with the environment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the dog's fur retain its natural texture and detail without showing any unnatural artifacts after being placed in the snowy environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's fur in Image B shows fine details and texture, resembling the natural appearance of a golden retriever's coat. There are no visible artifacts or distortions that would suggest digital manipulation. The fur's sheen and individual strands are clear, indicating that the image editing has preserved the natural look of the fur.",

      "question": "Are the size and proportions of the dog and its blue mat appropriately scaled in relation to the tent and other elements of the snowy campsite?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog and its blue mat in Image B appear appropriately sized relative to the tent and other elements in the campsite. The proportions seem realistic; the dog is not disproportionately large or small compared to the tent, and the mat fits naturally within the scene. This scaling suggests careful attention to maintaining realistic proportions during the editing process.",

    {

      "question": "Are the edges of the dog and its blue mat smoothly integrated into the snowy mountain campsite without any visible jagged or unnatural lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the dog and its blue mat in Image B blend smoothly into the snowy background. There are no jagged lines or unnatural borders that would indicate poor integration. The transition from the dog and mat to the snow looks seamless, suggesting that the editing was done with care to ensure a natural appearance.",

      "question": "Does the dog's posture and the overall layout of the snowy campsite appear natural and free from distortion or unnatural positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog's posture in Image B is relaxed and natural, as if it is resting comfortably on the mat. The overall layout of the campsite, including the placement of the tent and other camping gear, appears undistorted and logically arranged for a snowy environment. There are no signs of unnatural positioning or distortion that would detract from the realism of the scene.",
