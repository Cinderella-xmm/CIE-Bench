      "question": "Does the miniature beach and surfer figure inside the snow globe appear structurally consistent and visually credible compared to the original beach scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature scene inside the snow globe replicates the original beach setting with a sunset, ocean waves, and a surfer. The lighting and color palette—golden hues of the sunset, reflections on water, and warm tones—are consistent with the original image. However, the scale is drastically reduced, and the elements are stylized in a chibi or cartoonish manner. Despite this stylistic shift, the core components (sun, sea, sand, and surfer) maintain structural coherence with the original scene. The composition within the globe preserves the spatial relationship between the surfer and the environment, albeit in a simplified form. While not photorealistic, it remains visually credible as a symbolic representation of the original scene. The transformation from real-life to miniature is plausible given the context of a snow globe, which inherently abstracts reality into a decorative format.",

      "question": "Are the hands of the chibi-style 3D surfer figure free of unnatural textures and maintain the correct number of fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure has simplified proportions typical of such character designs. Upon close inspection, the hands appear smooth and lack any visible texture anomalies like pixelation, rough edges, or irregular shading. The figure's right hand is shown holding a wax block, and the left hand rests on the surfboard. Both hands display five fingers, consistent with human anatomy. While the fingers are stylized and slightly rounded due to the chibi aesthetic, they are correctly proportioned and countable. There are no signs of distortion, extra digits, or missing fingers. Given that chibi art often exaggerates features while maintaining basic anatomical correctness, the hands appear natural within the artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the soft golden light and sparkles scattered around the snow globe create a natural and plausible warm atmosphere without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the snow globe is dominated by a warm, golden glow emanating from the internal sunset scene, which mirrors the ambient light of the fireplace in the background. This creates a cohesive and inviting atmosphere. The sparkles are distributed subtly throughout the globe, resembling glitter or magical particles, enhancing the whimsical feel. These effects are common in decorative snow globes and do not appear overdone or digitally intrusive. There are no harsh edges, unnatural glows, or repetitive patterns that would suggest digital artifacts. Instead, the sparkles blend smoothly with the light, contributing to a dreamy, festive ambiance. The interplay between the internal glow and external firelight enhances realism without breaking immersion.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the miniature surfer figure and surfboard remain intact and undistorted within the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfer figure and surfboard are rendered in a stylized but geometrically coherent manner. The surfboard maintains its classic elongated oval shape with a defined nose and tail, and the surface appears flat and uniform. The surfer figure, though chibi-styled, retains symmetrical limbs, a rounded head, and proportional body parts. There are no visible warping, stretching, or compression effects that would indicate distortion. The perspective within the snow globe is consistent, and the objects are not affected by lens-like distortions or refraction errors. The glass sphere does not visibly alter the geometry of the figures, suggesting careful rendering to preserve shape integrity. Thus, despite the small scale and artistic style, the geometric forms remain intact.",

      "question": "Is the placement of the snow globe on the wooden shelf near the fireplace visually credible and proportionally realistic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe is placed on a wooden shelf that appears sturdy and appropriately sized for such an object. The shelf's depth and width are sufficient to support the globe securely. In the background, a lit fireplace provides a warm, ambient light source that complements the glow from within the globe. The relative size of the snow globe compared to the shelf and surrounding elements (like the fireplace frame and wall) suggests a realistic scale. The positioning allows the globe to be clearly visible and centered, indicating intentional placement for display purposes. There is no disproportion or imbalance; the shadowing and lighting further enhance the sense of depth and realism. Overall, the scene feels natural and thoughtfully composed, consistent with how one might place a decorative item in a home setting.",
