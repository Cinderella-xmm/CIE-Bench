    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style representation of the bandage inside the packaging maintain structural coherence without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
    "explanation": "The chibi-style bandage within the packaging appears to be a stylized, cartoonish version of a bandage. It maintains a recognizable shape and structure consistent with a bandage, including the central pad and adhesive strips. The texture is simplified but coherent with the style, avoiding any unnatural distortions that would disrupt its appearance as a playful, toy-like version of a bandage.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the fabric texture and adhesive surface of the realistic bandage outside the packaging depicted with high detail and free from artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The realistic bandage outside the packaging shows detailed textures on both the fabric and the adhesive surface. The fabric has a woven pattern that is clearly visible, and the adhesive area looks smooth and consistent. There are no visible artifacts or distortions that would detract from the realism of the depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the packaging design, including the isometric perspective and the label 'HEALING ESSENTIALS,' integrate naturally into the scene without disrupting visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "The packaging design uses an isometric perspective which adds depth and dimensionality to the scene. The label 'HEALING ESSENTIALS' is clear and legible, fitting well with the theme of the product. The overall design complements the scene by providing context for the items displayed, enhancing rather than disrupting the visual credibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are the proportions and placement of the chibi-style bandage within the packaging logically consistent with the realistic bandage outside, avoiding any distortion?",
    "explanation": "The chibi-style bandage inside the packaging is proportionally smaller and placed in a way that mimics the realistic bandage outside. Both share similar structural elements like the central pad and adhesive strips, ensuring consistency. The difference in style (chibi vs. realistic) is intentional and does not introduce logical inconsistencies or distortions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Do the materials used for the packaging and the realistic bandage appear natural and consistent with their intended purpose, without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The materials of the packaging and the realistic bandage look appropriate for their purposes. The packaging material seems like typical cardboard with printed graphics, while the bandage displays a fabric texture and adhesive surface that are consistent with real-world bandages. There are no noticeable artifacts that would suggest unnatural qualities.",
    "answer": "Yes"
