      "question": "Do the holographic widgets and 3D elements on the smartphone screen appear seamlessly integrated with the device's surface, maintaining consistent depth cues and shadowing that match the phone's form factor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the smartphone displays several holographic elements such as floating data boxes, a biometric hand scan, and translucent UI components that extend beyond the physical screen. These elements are rendered in a bright cyan-blue hue with glow effects, suggesting a futuristic interface. However, they lack realistic depth integration with the phone’s surface—there is no visible shadowing or occlusion where these elements overlap the edges of the device. The holograms appear to float independently without interacting with the phone’s physical contours, such as the rounded corners or bezels. In real-world rendering, proper depth cues would include soft shadows cast by the holograms onto the phone’s surface or subtle refraction effects near the edges. Here, the holograms seem digitally superimposed rather than physically integrated, violating consistent depth perception. This suggests a lack of seamless integration.",

      "question": "Is the forward-projection effect of the smartphone screen visually coherent, with no distortion of the phone’s frame or screen edges, and does it maintain proper spatial relationship with the hand holding it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The smartphone in Image B appears to have a forward-projection effect where digital elements seem to emanate from the screen into space. However, this projection introduces visual inconsistencies. The holographic elements (like the hand scan and data cubes) extend outward but do not interact realistically with the hand holding the phone. For example, the fingers partially overlap these projections without casting shadows or being obscured by them, which breaks the spatial logic. Additionally, the phone’s frame remains unaltered despite the apparent projection, suggesting the effect is applied post-production without regard for perspective or occlusion. A coherent forward-projection would show the hand interacting naturally with the projected elements—e.g., fingers blocking parts of the hologram or casting shadows on it. Since none of these cues are present, the spatial relationship is compromised.",

      "question": "Does the biometric hand scanning overlay align precisely with the hand’s natural anatomy, showing accurate finger positions and skin texture, without introducing extra fingers or distorted proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The biometric hand scan in Image B is a translucent blue holographic representation of a hand overlaid on the actual hand. While the general shape matches the user’s hand, there are noticeable discrepancies. The holographic fingers appear slightly elongated and misaligned with the real fingers—especially the thumb and index finger—suggesting poor registration between the real anatomy and the digital model. Moreover, the scan lacks detailed skin texture, pores, or realistic lighting interaction with the underlying hand, making it look like a generic template rather than a precise scan. There is no indication of additional fingers, but the proportional mismatch and lack of anatomical fidelity undermine its accuracy. In a real biometric system, such overlays would require high-precision alignment and realistic rendering to be effective.",

      "question": "Is the futuristic skyline displayed on the laptop screen rendered with consistent geometry and perspective, and does it align naturally with the laptop’s bezel and keyboard without clipping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laptop screen in Image B displays a vibrant, futuristic cityscape with skyscrapers and glowing lines, suggesting a digital dashboard or augmented reality view. However, the skyline image extends beyond the physical boundaries of the laptop screen, particularly at the top-right corner, where buildings appear to 'float' above the bezel. This creates an unnatural visual effect, as if the display content is not confined within the screen’s limits. Furthermore, the perspective of the skyline does not align with the laptop’s viewing angle—the horizon line is tilted inconsistently relative to the keyboard and base of the device. In reality, a screen image should respect the device’s frame and maintain correct perspective based on the viewer’s position. The presence of clipping and incorrect scaling indicates that the skyline was composited without proper spatial awareness.",

      "question": "Do the smartphone and laptop displays share consistent visual design elements (e.g., blue color palette, futuristic typography, and interface style) that create a cohesive technological narrative without conflicting styles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both the smartphone and laptop screens in Image B utilize a dominant blue color scheme, featuring glowing lines, circular gauges, and digital text—hallmarks of a futuristic tech aesthetic. The smartphone shows stock tickers and performance graphs with clean, minimalist typography, while the laptop displays a cityscape with similar blue-hued UI elements, including progress bars and data readouts. The overall design language is unified: both use neon-blue highlights, geometric shapes, and a sci-fi-inspired interface style. Although the content differs (financial data vs. urban landscape), the visual motifs—such as transparency, layered data, and glowing outlines—are consistent across devices. This shared design vocabulary reinforces a cohesive narrative of advanced technology, suggesting a synchronized ecosystem. Therefore, despite different content, the stylistic coherence is maintained.",
