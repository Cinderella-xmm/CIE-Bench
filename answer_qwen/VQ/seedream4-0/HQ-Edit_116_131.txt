    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral patterns on the qipao clearly defined with consistent outlines and no broken or distorted petals?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the qipao are rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner typical of anime or digital art. The petals are outlined clearly with smooth, continuous lines, and each flower maintains a symmetrical and coherent shape. There are no visible breaks, distortions, or irregularities in the petal forms. The shading and color gradients within the flowers are consistent, reinforcing their structural integrity. Given that this is a digital illustration, the design adheres to artistic conventions where clarity and consistency are prioritized. Therefore, based on visual analysis and understanding of digital art standards, the floral patterns appear well-defined and undistorted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the jade-patterned clasps align correctly along the central seam and display consistent shape and size without deformation?",
    "explanation": "The jade-patterned clasps in Image B are depicted as decorative elements running vertically along the central front of the qipao. They follow a traditional Chinese knot motif, which is common in qipao designs. Each clasp is uniformly shaped, with consistent proportions and spacing between them. There is no visible stretching, warping, or misalignment; they form a straight, symmetrical line down the center. In digital illustrations, such symmetry is often emphasized for aesthetic balance. The rendering shows no deformation, and the repetition of the clasp pattern is regular, indicating careful design execution. Thus, the clasps align properly and maintain consistent form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the color distribution across the qipao uniform, with no visible banding or abrupt transitions between hues?",
    "explanation": "The red fabric of the qipao in Image B exhibits a smooth gradient that simulates satin-like sheen, typical in digital illustrations aiming for realism within an artistic style. The color transitions from darker to lighter shades are gradual and blend seamlessly, especially noticeable on the curved areas like the shoulder and chest. There are no visible horizontal bands or sharp edges that would suggest compression artifacts or poor rendering. The lighting appears consistent, enhancing the fabric's texture without introducing unnatural hue shifts. This suggests a high-quality digital painting technique where color diffusion is carefully controlled. Therefore, the color distribution is uniform and free from banding.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the detachable writing sections placed with clean edges and consistent lighting, and do they appear anchored to the garment rather than floating?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, two rectangular pieces resembling handwritten notes or envelopes are held by the character’s hand. These elements have clean, sharp edges and are shaded with soft gradients that match the overall lighting direction of the scene (from the upper left). The shadows beneath the paper and the way light reflects off their surfaces suggest they are physically resting against the qipao. Furthermore, the positioning of the hands around the papers implies a natural grip, and the papers are not overlapping or suspended without support. Their placement aligns with the folds of the garment, and there is no visual indication of floating or improper anchoring. This demonstrates attention to spatial coherence in digital composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the hand show five fingers with normal spacing, natural curvature, and no extra or missing digits?",
    "explanation": "The hand in Image B displays five distinct fingers—thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky—with appropriate spacing and curvature. The fingers are proportionally spaced, and their bending follows anatomical plausibility, particularly in how the index finger curves slightly over the other fingers while holding the papers. The knuckles and joints are subtly indicated, contributing to a realistic appearance within the stylized art form. There are no extra fingers or missing digits, and the overall structure matches human hand anatomy. While stylized, the hand retains functional proportions and natural pose, consistent with standard digital character design practices.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are all elements of the qipao and added components proportionally balanced and spatially coherent without stretching or compression?",
    "explanation": "The qipao in Image B is proportionally accurate to traditional designs, with balanced sleeve length, collar height, and body fit. The floral patterns scale consistently across the garment, and the jade clasps follow a symmetrical layout. The added elements—such as the handheld papers—are positioned naturally within the character’s grasp and do not disrupt the garment’s silhouette. There is no visible distortion in limb or clothing proportions; the torso, arms, and head maintain harmonious scaling. Lighting and shadows reinforce depth and volume without suggesting compression or stretching. Overall, the composition adheres to principles of visual harmony and spatial logic in digital illustration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
