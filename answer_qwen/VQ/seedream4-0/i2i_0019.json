      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine of the elephant retain the natural grass-eating pose without introducing unnatural distortions or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style elephant figurine is depicted in a grass-eating pose, which is natural for elephants. The trunk is curled around the grass, and the body posture is consistent with an animal feeding. There are no visible distortions or deformations that would make this pose unnatural for an elephant. The analysis is based on observing the figurine's posture and comparing it to known behaviors of real elephants.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures of the elephant's skin in the figurine realistic, showing natural details without appearing overly smooth or artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures on the elephant's skin in the figurine appear smooth and lack detailed wrinkles or roughness typically seen on real elephant skin. This suggests that the texture is more artificial and stylized rather than realistic. Comparing this to Image A, where the actual elephant has detailed and rough skin texture, the figurine's skin lacks these natural details.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the base design mimic a muddy terrain naturally and complement the elephant figurine without creating visible gaps or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base design includes small patches of greenery and brown terrain that mimic a muddy environment. It complements the elephant figurine well without any visible gaps between the base and the figurine. The design appears cohesive and enhances the scene's natural feel. No inconsistencies are observed in the transition from the figurine to the base.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transparent acrylic dome over the figurine clear and does it not cause distracting reflections or distortions on the figurine or the surrounding base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent acrylic dome over the figurine is clear, allowing a full view of the elephant and its surroundings. There are no noticeable reflections or distortions that detract from the view of the figurine or the base. The clarity of the dome contributes positively to the overall presentation of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are there no noticeable artifacts, such as missing components or misplaced shadows, that disrupt the visual plausibility of the figurine scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the figurine scene, there are no missing components or misplaced shadows that disrupt the visual plausibility. All elements, including the elephant, grass, and base, are well-integrated, and the lighting appears consistent throughout the scene. The absence of such artifacts ensures a visually coherent and plausible representation.",
