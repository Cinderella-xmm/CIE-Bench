      "question": "Does the mango retain its recognizable shape and texture in the 8-bit pixel art style without appearing overly distorted or unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango is rendered in an 8-bit pixel art style, which uses a limited color palette and blocky pixels to represent forms. Despite this stylization, the overall oval shape of the mango is preserved and remains clearly identifiable as a mango due to its characteristic elongated form and central stem. The texture, while simplified into large blocks of color, still suggests a smooth surface with subtle shading that mimics natural curvature. Although fine details like skin pores are lost, the general silhouette and volume are maintained. This level of abstraction is typical in pixel art and does not distort the object beyond recognition. Based on common sense and visual perception, objects in pixel art often lose detail but retain core shape—here, the mango’s identity is preserved. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mango retains its recognizable shape and texture within the constraints of the artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the table and napkin depicted with consistent structure and proportions in the 8-bit pixel art style, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or disproportionate elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The table in Image B appears as a wooden surface with visible grain patterns rendered in pixelated form. The edges and corners of the table are angular and follow a logical rectangular structure, maintaining consistent proportions relative to the scene. The napkin beneath the mango is folded in a way that resembles a cradle-like shape, with distinct folds and creases represented through pixelated shading. While the pixelation simplifies the textures, the overall geometry of both the table and napkin remains intact and coherent. There are no jagged or broken lines that suggest structural errors, nor are there disproportionately sized elements. In pixel art, such simplifications are expected, but here the spatial relationships remain plausible and stable. Comparing with standard expectations of pixel art rendering, the composition avoids geometric distortion. Thus, the structure and proportions appear consistent and credible.",

      "question": "Do the fine details of the mango's surface and the napkin's texture remain discernible in the 8-bit pixel art style, without significant loss or introduction of unnatural patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mango’s surface lacks fine details such as tiny blemishes or natural skin texture due to the low resolution of the 8-bit style. Instead, it features broad color gradients and blocky shading to simulate depth. Similarly, the napkin’s texture—originally showing a diamond-patterned weave in the original image—is reduced to generalized light and dark areas, losing much of the intricate pattern. While the general appearance of texture is suggested (e.g., fold shadows and highlights), the actual fine details are significantly abstracted. Pixel art inherently sacrifices detail for stylistic clarity, so some loss is expected. However, no unnatural or artificial patterns (like glitches or repetitive artifacts) are introduced. The simplification is consistent with the medium. Hence, although fine details are not preserved, they are replaced by stylistically appropriate approximations rather than distortions.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and shadow effects on the mango and table in the 8-bit pixel art style appear natural and plausible, without introducing any obvious artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B suggests a directional light source from the upper left, casting shadows to the right and below the mango and napkin. These shadows are represented with pixelated gradients, though they are less smooth than in the original image. The mango shows a highlight on its upper-left side and a darker tone on the opposite side, consistent with how light interacts with a rounded object. The shadow under the napkin and mango is also present and aligned with the light direction. While the pixelation causes some stair-step edges and abrupt transitions, these are typical of 8-bit art and do not constitute artifacts. There are no floating shadows, mismatched highlights, or impossible lighting angles. The overall effect remains plausible within the constraints of the style. Thus, despite simplification, the lighting and shadows are natural and coherent.",

      "question": "Is the composition and layout of the mango, napkin, and table in the 8-bit pixel art style visually credible and structurally sound, without any elements appearing misplaced or out of context?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B maintains the same spatial arrangement as the original: the mango sits centrally on a folded napkin, which rests on a wooden table. The relative positions of these elements are preserved, with the napkin supporting the mango and the table providing a base. The background includes a chair and wall, which contribute to a realistic indoor setting. Although all elements are stylized with pixelation, their placement and orientation are consistent with real-world physics and perspective. There are no floating objects, misaligned layers, or contextual mismatches. The scene remains grounded and coherent, even in the simplified style. This reflects good compositional integrity, where artistic style does not compromise structural logic. Therefore, the layout is visually credible and structurally sound.",
