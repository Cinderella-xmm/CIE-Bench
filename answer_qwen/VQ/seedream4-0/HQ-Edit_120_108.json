    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the added cogs and gears on the lamp's armature properly aligned with the existing structure, maintaining consistent proportions and smooth transitions without visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cogs and gears added to the lamp's armature appear to be carefully aligned with the existing structure. The proportions seem consistent as the mechanical elements follow the curvature of the lamp's arm, suggesting a deliberate design choice. There are no visible seams or texture mismatches that would indicate poor integration; instead, the cogs blend smoothly into the metallic surface. This analysis is based on observing how the mechanical additions respect the original form and material characteristics of the lamp.",

      "question": "Do the page edges of the open book display cog-like patterns that are integrated seamlessly into the paper texture without distorting the natural curl or layering of the pages?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The page edges of the open book in Image B display cog-like patterns that are integrated into the paper texture. These patterns do not distort the natural curl or layering of the pages, maintaining the realistic appearance of an aged book. The seamless integration suggests a careful editing process where the new patterns were designed to complement the existing texture without disrupting the visual flow of the pages.",

      "question": "Are the rivet patterns applied to the floral wallpaper evenly spaced and dimensionally consistent with the wall surface, without causing distortions in the flower shapes or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rivet patterns applied to the floral wallpaper in Image B are evenly spaced and dimensionally consistent with the wall surface. They do not cause any noticeable distortions in the flower shapes or shadows. The rivets appear to be part of a frame surrounding the wallpaper, which logically explains their presence and spacing. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity and placement of the rivets relative to the wallpaper and its floral design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color tone of the edited elements (lamp, books, wallpaper) consistent with the original warm vintage palette, showing no abrupt shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color tone of the edited elements in Image B (lamp, books, wallpaper) remains consistent with the original warm vintage palette. There are no abrupt shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt the visual harmony. The warm lighting from the lamp enhances the vintage feel, and the colors of the added mechanical elements match the existing tones, contributing to a cohesive aesthetic. Comparing this with Image A, the same warm tones dominate both images, ensuring continuity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the mechanical additions (cogs, gears, rivets) proportionally scaled and structurally anchored to existing surfaces, avoiding floating or misaligned components that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical additions such as cogs, gears, and rivets in Image B are proportionally scaled and structurally anchored to existing surfaces. They do not appear to float or be misaligned, indicating a well-thought-out design that respects spatial logic. For instance, the gears on the lamp's arm are appropriately sized and positioned along the curve, while the rivets on the frame align perfectly with the edges. This assessment is based on evaluating the alignment and scale of these elements within the context of the image.",
