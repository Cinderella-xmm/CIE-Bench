      "question": "Do the armor-like rock sections maintain visible sedimentary layering and natural erosion contours consistent with the surrounding cliff face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The armor-like rock sections in Image B are designed to resemble a colossal, anthropomorphic figure integrated into the cliffside. Upon close inspection, these sections exhibit layered textures that mimic sedimentary rock formations, with horizontal striations and weathered surfaces that align with the natural erosion patterns seen in the surrounding cliffs. The curvature and depth of the rock segments follow geological logic—such as overhangs, undercutting, and angular fractures typical of long-term erosion by wind and water. Furthermore, the transitions between the 'armor' and the natural cliff appear seamless, suggesting continuity in material and formation history. This integration implies that the armor is not an artificial addition but rather a transformation of the existing geology, which supports the idea of consistent sedimentary layering and erosion contours.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the moss growth confined to shaded or moist areas of the rock armor and does it show natural variation in density and color rather than uniform application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Moss growth on rock surfaces in nature tends to occur in damp, shaded, or protected microclimates where moisture retention is higher. In Image B, the moss appears primarily in crevices, under overhangs, and along the lower parts of the armored structure—areas that would naturally accumulate moisture and receive less direct sunlight. The distribution is not uniform; instead, it varies in thickness and hue, ranging from bright green to darker, more desaturated patches, indicating differing levels of hydration and exposure. These variations suggest realistic biological behavior, such as moss thriving in sheltered zones while thinning out in exposed regions. The placement and texture of the moss align with ecological principles of plant colonization on rocky substrates.",

      "question": "Do the spectral limbs originate from the cliff base and merge with the sea surface in a way that preserves water-level continuity and avoids floating or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spectral limbs (semi-transparent, glowing appendages) emerge from the lower part of the giant figure's body near the cliff base and extend downward into the sea. They interact with the water surface in a manner that respects physical continuity—their luminous trails appear to dissolve into the waves rather than hover above them. The glow emanating from the limbs interacts with the water, creating ripples and reflections that match the ambient lighting and wave dynamics. There is no visual break or gap between the limb ends and the waterline, suggesting a fluid transition. This design avoids the illusion of floating or detachment by integrating the spectral forms into the environmental physics of water displacement and light refraction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the trees forming the mane spaced irregularly and angled naturally along the cliff edge, consistent with wind exposure and terrain slope?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees positioned atop the figure’s head and along the cliff edge in Image B are arranged asymmetrically, with varying spacing and orientations. Some lean outward, likely due to persistent wind pressure from the sea, while others grow upright in sheltered spots. Their positioning follows the contour of the cliff, adapting to the slope and elevation changes. This irregularity reflects real-world tree growth patterns in coastal environments, where strong winds, soil stability, and exposure influence morphology. The presence of smaller, stunted trees compared to larger ones further suggests adaptation to harsh conditions. These details collectively support a naturalistic interpretation of vegetation under environmental stress.",

      "question": "Do the runes follow natural rock fissures and exhibit soft edges with shadowing that matches ambient lighting, rather than appearing as crisp, untextured overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The runes inscribed on the rock face in Image B are carved into what appear to be natural cracks and crevices in the stone. Their edges are not sharply defined like digital text but instead blend into the rock texture, with subtle chipping and erosion around the characters. The lighting casts soft shadows within the grooves of the runes, consistent with the direction of the low-angle sunlight from the setting sun. Additionally, the depth and wear of the carvings suggest age and exposure, enhancing their realism. Rather than being flat or superimposed, the runes seem embedded into the rock, respecting both geological form and illumination cues.",

      "question": "Do the spiraling spirits emit or absorb light in a way that matches the sun's position and create subtle volume effects consistent with mist or vapor, without sharp edges or unnatural opacity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spiraling spirits in Image B are rendered as translucent, swirling energy forms that glow with a cool blue hue. They are illuminated from the side, consistent with the low-angle sunlight coming from the horizon, casting soft highlights and gentle gradients across their forms. The spirits do not have hard outlines; instead, they fade into the atmosphere with diffuse edges, mimicking the behavior of mist or vapor under natural lighting. Their volume is suggested through internal luminosity and slight opacity variations, giving them a sense of depth without appearing solid or artificially opaque. This treatment aligns with atmospheric physics and visual perception of ethereal phenomena in natural settings.",
