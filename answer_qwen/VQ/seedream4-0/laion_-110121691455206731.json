    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) positioned on the dial such that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials, and do they blend with the metallic texture without introducing unnatural shading or edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the watch has been anthropomorphized with facial features. The eyes and mouth are positioned on the dial in a way that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials. They appear to be integrated into the metallic texture of the watch face without introducing unnatural shading or edges. This is evident from the smooth blending of the features with the existing design elements of the watch.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the detective desk and magnifying glass proportionally sized relative to the watch, and are they rendered with consistent line weight and shading that matches the comic style without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The detective desk and magnifying glass in Image B are proportionally sized relative to the watch, maintaining a consistent comic style with uniform line weight and shading. There is no geometric distortion, and these elements are rendered in a manner that matches the overall artistic style of the image.",

      "question": "Do the background elements (cluttered office items) appear spatially coherent with the watch, showing correct layering and perspective without overlapping or clipping through the watch's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements in Image B, such as the cluttered office items, are spatially coherent with the watch. They show correct layering and perspective, with no overlapping or clipping through the watch's body. The watch appears to be in the foreground, while the background elements are appropriately placed behind it.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tick mark sound effects around the dial in Image B are uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered. They do not have jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing. These sound effects are well-integrated into the design, contributing to the comic-style presentation of the watch.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stylized version in Image B retains the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case. There is no visible texture warping or color inconsistency. The materials appear true to their original characteristics, maintaining the quality and appearance of the watch.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window in Image B are preserved in their original positions and proportions. They are not obscured or deformed by the added facial features or other elements. The functional aspects of the watch remain intact despite the anthropomorphic additions.",
