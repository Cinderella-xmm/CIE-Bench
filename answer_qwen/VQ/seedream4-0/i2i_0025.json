      "question": "Does the woman’s face exhibit natural contours and shading without visible unnatural textures or blotches in the watercolor style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's face is rendered in a watercolor style, which inherently uses soft washes and blended tones to mimic natural skin texture. Upon close inspection, her facial features—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—are well-defined with smooth gradients that follow typical human anatomy. The shading around her cheeks and jawline appears consistent with directional lighting from above, suggesting a single light source (likely overhead). There are no abrupt color shifts or patchy areas that would indicate digital artifacts or blotches. While watercolor art often involves intentional texture, the rendering here maintains a lifelike quality without overemphasizing graininess or uneven pigment application. This suggests that the artist has preserved natural contours effectively within the stylistic constraints of watercolor.",

      "question": "Are the background figures appropriately simplified with light lines and washes, avoiding unnatural geometric breaks or inconsistencies in their form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in Image B are depicted using lighter outlines and translucent washes, characteristic of watercolor simplification techniques. Their forms are generalized rather than detailed, which is typical when prioritizing foreground focus in artistic renderings. However, despite this abstraction, each figure retains recognizable human proportions: heads are rounded, torsos are upright, and limbs are positioned plausibly. There are no sharp, angular breaks or distorted geometries that would suggest misrendering. For example, the person on the far left has a clearly defined shoulder and arm posture, while others maintain seated positions consistent with a group setting. The use of faint lines for clothing folds and subtle color variations avoids mechanical rigidity. This indicates thoughtful simplification that preserves spatial coherence without introducing visual anomalies.",

      "question": "Is the woman's hand holding the wine glass composed of five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, avoiding unnatural artifacts or shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s hand is shown gripping the stem of the wine glass. The hand displays five distinct fingers, each with appropriate curvature and spacing. The thumb is positioned on one side of the stem, while the other four fingers wrap around it naturally. Although the watercolor style softens edges slightly, the relative lengths and angles of the fingers remain anatomically plausible. There are no fused digits, elongated segments, or irregular bulges that would suggest digital distortion. The nails are also subtly indicated, maintaining proportionality. Compared to real-life expectations of a relaxed grip, the hand’s pose is consistent with how someone might hold a wine glass during a social gathering. Thus, despite the artistic medium, the hand retains naturalistic structure.",

      "question": "Does the wine glass appear transparent with subtle reflections, consistent with its real-life properties, without losing fine details or becoming overly stylized in the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wine glass in Image B is rendered with a degree of transparency, indicated by the way the background elements are faintly visible through the glass. Subtle highlights along the rim and stem suggest reflective surfaces, mimicking light interaction with glass. While the watercolor technique inherently reduces sharpness, the shape of the glass remains accurate—tapered bowl, slender stem, and base. There is no evidence of exaggerated warping or loss of structural definition; the outline stays intact and proportional. The presence of minimal internal shading implies depth and thickness, aligning with physical properties of glassware. Though not photorealistic, the representation balances artistic interpretation with realistic physics, preserving essential details like clarity and reflection without over-stylization.",

      "question": "Do the shadows and interactions between the woman, her glass, and the table appear consistent with lighting and spatial positioning, avoiding any visual distortion or floating effects after the watercolor transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to originate from above, as suggested by the soft shadows cast beneath the woman’s chin and the slight darkening under her arm. The wine glass casts a faint shadow onto the table, indicating proper alignment with the light source. The table surface shows gentle tonal variation, implying a flat plane consistent with the surrounding environment. The woman’s body does not appear detached or 'floating' above the table; her posture and the placement of her hand suggest contact with the surface. Moreover, the glass rests securely in her hand, and there is no visual gap or misalignment that would imply incorrect depth perception. Even in watercolor, where shadows can be diffused, the overall composition maintains logical spatial relationships. Therefore, the interplay between light, object, and surface remains coherent and physically plausible.",
