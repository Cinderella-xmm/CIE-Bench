      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or missing details where the vase is replaced with floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the vase has been replaced with a structure composed entirely of flowers. The texture appears consistent with that of petals and blossoms, which suggests that the transformation was done with attention to detail. There are no visible gaps or abrupt changes in texture that would indicate missing details. The floral arrangement seems dense enough to cover what would have been the surface of the vase.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral elements replacing the vase maintain proper proportions and avoid distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral elements in Image B follow the general shape and proportions of a typical vase. The top part is narrower, expanding outward towards the middle and then tapering down again at the base, mimicking the silhouette of a vase. The flowers are arranged in such a way that they do not distort these proportions but rather enhance them by following the contours naturally.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the floral transformation retain structural consistency and blend naturally with the original vase shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral elements in Image B closely adhere to the outline of a traditional vase, maintaining its structural integrity. The flowers are densely packed and strategically placed to mimic the smooth curves and lines of a vase. This careful placement ensures that the floral transformation blends seamlessly with the expected form of a vase.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the transition between the vase and floral elements seamless without visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the transition from the lower part of the vase-like structure to the upper part covered in flowers appears smooth. There are no noticeable edges, lines, or artifacts that disrupt the flow of the floral design. The flowers seem to grow naturally from the base upwards, creating a cohesive and seamless appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the arrangement of flowers in the vase-like structure appear natural and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of flowers in Image B looks natural and believable as a floral sculpture. The density and distribution of the flowers create a realistic impression of a vase filled with blossoms. The variety in flower orientation and layering adds depth and dimension, contributing to a visually credible and aesthetically pleasing result.",
