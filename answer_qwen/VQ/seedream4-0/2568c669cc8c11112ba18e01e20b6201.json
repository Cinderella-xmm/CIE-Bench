      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the stat bars positioned such that they do not cover any part of the mother's or child's face, hands, or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stat bars are located at the bottom portion of the image, beneath the figures. The mother and child are seated, with their lower bodies extending downward, but the stat bars are placed below the visible parts of their clothing and legs. The bars are aligned horizontally and do not intersect with any facial features, hands, or upper garments. Based on visual inspection, the placement ensures that no anatomical or clothing details are obscured by the stat bars. This positioning is typical in card design to preserve the integrity of the central artwork while providing information in a non-intrusive manner.",

      "question": "Does the ribbon-textured banner sit above the figures without distorting the hair or altering the natural curvature of the heads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ribbon-textured banner in Image B is positioned at the top center of the image, above the heads of both the mother and child. It appears to be a digital overlay designed to resemble an aged scroll. There is no visible distortion of the hair or alteration of the head shapes beneath it. The edges of the banner are clean and do not intrude into the hairline or interfere with the natural contours of the figures' heads. The banner floats above the figures without warping or compressing the underlying image, maintaining the original proportions and spatial relationships. This suggests careful layering and alignment during editing.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the golden nameplate positioned below the figures without overlapping the legs or skirt, and does it display a smooth, reflective surface without pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden nameplate in Image B is located at the very bottom center, beneath the figures. It is clearly separated from the lower edges of the clothing and drapery, ensuring no overlap with the legs or skirt. The nameplate has a polished, metallic appearance with subtle highlights and gradients that suggest a reflective surface. Upon close inspection, there are no visible pixelation artifacts or jagged edges along its borders, indicating high-resolution rendering and anti-aliasing techniques were used. The smoothness and clarity of the surface contribute to a professional, cohesive design aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the ornate filigree frame enclose the entire image without cutting off any part of the figures, drapery, or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ornate filigree frame in Image B surrounds the entire composition, forming a decorative border around the central artwork. The frame extends outward from the edge of the image content, leaving sufficient margin around all sides. The figures, including their full drapery and the background, are fully contained within the inner boundary of the frame. There is no truncation or cropping of the figures’ limbs, clothing, or the surrounding backdrop. The frame’s design is symmetrical and well-aligned, suggesting intentional placement to preserve the integrity of the original painting while enhancing its presentation as a collectible or game card.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the parchment backdrop uniformly blended behind the figures, with no visible edges, color mismatches, or shadow inconsistencies along the figure outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment backdrop in Image B has a textured, aged paper appearance that serves as the background for the entire card. The blending between the backdrop and the figures is generally smooth, with soft transitions around the edges of the mother and child. However, upon closer inspection, especially along the outer edges of the drapery and hair, there are faint signs of slight color mismatch or minor haloing effects—subtle indications of digital compositing. These are not severe enough to disrupt the overall harmony but suggest imperfect masking or blending. While mostly uniform, the presence of these minor inconsistencies means the blend is not perfectly seamless.",

      "question": "Do the skin tones and lighting on the mother and child remain consistent with the original image, with no unnatural color shifts or brightness changes caused by overlay elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skin tones and lighting on the mother and child in Image B appear largely consistent with those in the original painting (Image A). The warm, soft illumination and natural shading are preserved, and there are no obvious color casts or brightness fluctuations introduced by the overlays. The addition of the parchment background, banner, and stat bars does not seem to have altered the underlying image’s tonal balance. The transparency and layering of the added elements were likely handled carefully to avoid affecting the original artwork’s color fidelity. No artificial glow, desaturation, or overexposure is evident, indicating a respectful preservation of the source material.",

      "question": "Are the text elements and decorative borders sharp and free from blurring, pixelation, or jagged lines that would indicate low-resolution rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements, including the name 'Srimy Chotlitcnectione', the stat values ('Empathy +10', 'Protection +9', etc.), and the decorative borders, are rendered with high clarity. The font styles are crisp, and the letterforms show no signs of blurring or pixelation. The ornamental frame and ribbon banner also feature intricate details that remain sharp, with smooth curves and clean lines. Anti-aliasing appears to have been applied effectively, minimizing jagged edges. The resolution of the image supports this level of detail, and the rendering quality suggests professional-grade graphic design work. All elements maintain visual integrity without degradation.",
