    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the hat symmetrical and aligned with the brim and crown, without jagged edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric patterns on the hat in Image B appear to be carefully designed with symmetry. The lines are straight and continuous, aligning well with the contours of the brim and crown. There are no visible jagged edges or broken lines, suggesting a high level of attention to detail in the design. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity and precision of the pattern's alignment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the gold accents on the brim follow the contour of the hat and reflect light naturally, without appearing as flat or detached patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents on the brim in Image B seem to follow the natural curve of the hat closely. They exhibit a reflective quality that suggests they are integrated into the fabric rather than being flat or separate elements. The way they catch and reflect light indicates a realistic rendering, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance of the hat.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the turquoise, cream, and silver motifs smoothly blended into the fabric, without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors of the motifs—turquoise, cream, and silver—are seamlessly integrated into the fabric. There are no noticeable pixelated edges or abrupt transitions between colors. The smooth blending contributes to a cohesive and polished look, which is consistent with high-quality textile designs.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the patterns on the hat avoid intersecting or distorting the natural wave and volume of the hair, maintaining clear separation between the two?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the hat in Image B do not interfere with the natural flow and volume of the hair. The separation between the hat and the hair is distinct, with no distortion or intersection of the patterns onto the hair. This maintains the integrity of both the hat's design and the hairstyle.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the shape of the hat’s brim and crown preserved with consistent thickness and curvature, without visible warping or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brim and crown of the hat in Image B maintain a consistent thickness and curvature. There are no signs of warping or deformation, indicating that the structural integrity of the hat has been preserved. The evenness of the shape suggests careful editing to ensure realism.",
