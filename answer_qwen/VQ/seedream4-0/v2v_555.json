      "question": "Does the snow globe surrounding the latte art appear structurally coherent without distorting the Colosseum and Big Ben designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow globe is depicted as a transparent spherical enclosure with a wooden base, containing miniature models of the Colosseum and Big Ben. The structures inside are clearly visible and proportionally consistent with their real-world counterparts. The curvature of the glass does not cause any noticeable warping or distortion of the buildings' shapes. The lighting and reflections on the glass surface are smooth and realistic, suggesting that the sphere's geometry is properly rendered. Given that the models are positioned centrally and symmetrically within the globe, and their architectural features (arches of the Colosseum, clock face and spire of Big Ben) remain intact and recognizable, it can be concluded that the snow globe maintains structural coherence. There is no visual evidence of forced perspective or geometric distortion that would compromise the integrity of the designs.",

      "question": "Are there any visible unnatural textures or artifacts where the latte art transitions into the snow globe's glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The transition from the latte art in Image A to the snow globe in Image B involves a conceptual transformation rather than a physical continuity. In Image B, the latte art is replaced by solid 3D models of the Colosseum and Big Ben inside a snow globe. There is no direct visual transition between latte foam and glass—instead, the scene shifts entirely to a snow globe setting. Therefore, there is no interface between 'latte art' and 'glass surface' to evaluate for artifacts. The glass surface of the snow globe itself appears smooth, with natural refraction effects and subtle reflections consistent with real glass. No pixelation, jagged edges, or texture mismatches are visible. Since the original latte art is not present in the snow globe, there are no artifacts at a non-existent transition point. Thus, the absence of such a transition renders the question moot in terms of visual anomalies.",

      "question": "Do the miniature versions of the Colosseum and Big Ben inside the snow globe maintain their correct proportions and avoid appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature models of the Colosseum and Big Ben inside the snow globe are carefully crafted to reflect their real-world architectural features. The Colosseum is shown with its iconic elliptical shape, multiple tiers of arches, and partial ruin aesthetic, all scaled down appropriately. Big Ben (Elizabeth Tower) is accurately represented with its clock face, Gothic Revival style, and spire. Both structures are positioned side-by-side within the globe, maintaining relative scale and spatial harmony. There is no stretching, compression, or angular distortion that would suggest digital manipulation errors. Their proportions align with known architectural ratios, and the depth perception within the globe suggests proper 3D modeling. Given the clarity and fidelity of the details, such as individual arches and clock numerals, the miniatures appear correctly proportioned and undistorted.",

      "question": "Do the snowflakes in the snow globe add to the charm of the winter scene without obscuring or degrading the fine details of the Colosseum and Big Ben?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes within the snow globe are stylized white flakes of varying sizes, suspended in the air above the miniature structures. They are translucent and lightly scattered, creating a festive winter atmosphere. Crucially, they do not cluster densely over the key architectural features of either the Colosseum or Big Ben. The snowflakes are small enough and spaced sufficiently apart that they enhance the visual appeal without blocking critical details like the arches, columns, or clock face. The lighting within the globe ensures that both the models and the snowflakes are illuminated clearly, allowing visibility of fine textures. This balance between decorative elements and clarity indicates that the snowflakes serve an aesthetic purpose without compromising legibility or detail.",

      "question": "Is the background of the edited image softly blurred with a cozy café atmosphere that complements the snow globe without introducing inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a warm, ambient café environment with soft bokeh lighting, wooden tables, and indistinct figures of patrons and furniture. The depth of field is shallow, focusing attention on the snow globe while blurring the surroundings—a common photographic technique to create intimacy and warmth. The lighting is golden and diffused, consistent with indoor café lighting during evening hours. Elements such as a bar counter, hanging lights, and potted plants are visible but out of focus, contributing to a relaxed and inviting ambiance. There are no visual inconsistencies—such as mismatched lighting, unrealistic shadows, or sudden color shifts—that would break the scene’s believability. The overall mood supports the theme of a nostalgic, cozy moment centered around the snow globe, making the background complementary and harmonious.",
