      "question": "Are the mountain shapes simplified into clear geometric forms without distorted edges or irregular facets that break their structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mountains are rendered using sharp, angular geometric shapes composed of triangles and polygons. These forms are consistent across the landscape, with clean edges and no irregularities or distortions. The use of flat color planes and defined facets indicates a deliberate stylistic simplification typical of low-poly or geometric art styles. This approach maintains structural consistency by avoiding organic curves or naturalistic undulations. Based on visual cues, the mountains are clearly abstracted into idealized geometric forms, which aligns with common practices in stylized digital art where realism is sacrificed for aesthetic clarity. There are no jagged, broken, or inconsistent facets observed; instead, the shapes form a coherent, unified composition.",

      "question": "Do the trees retain recognizable silhouettes with consistent geometric proportions and smooth outlines, avoiding fragmented or misshapen branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are stylized into simple geometric forms—primarily triangular or polygonal shapes—with solid colors and minimal detail. While they maintain recognizable silhouettes (e.g., coniferous trees as pointed triangles), their branches are absent or implied through basic lines rather than detailed structures. However, this abstraction does not introduce fragmentation or misshapen elements. Instead, each tree adheres to a consistent design language: uniform proportions, smooth outlines, and symmetrical forms. In contrast to realistic depictions, these trees are intentionally simplified, but within the context of the artwork’s style, they remain coherent and visually balanced. No broken or disjointed parts are visible, and the overall proportionality is preserved across all tree types.",

      "question": "Are the radiating parallel lines in the river aligned with its natural flow direction and spaced uniformly to maintain visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The river in Image B features a pattern of radiating parallel lines that converge toward the horizon, creating a sense of depth and movement. These lines are evenly spaced and extend from the foreground to the background, following the central axis of the river. Their alignment corresponds with the apparent flow direction of the river, enhancing the perception of forward motion toward the distant sun. The uniformity in spacing and orientation contributes to a strong visual rhythm and continuity. Although this representation is highly stylized and not physically accurate (as real rivers do not have such line patterns), within the artistic framework, the lines are consistently aligned and spaced to support the intended illusion of flow and perspective. Therefore, the visual logic of the design supports both alignment and uniformity.",

      "question": "Is the reflection in the river perfectly symmetrical to the elements above it, with matching shapes and positions of trees and mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the river contains a pattern of blue and white parallel lines that represent water, but there is no actual reflection of the surrounding landscape. Instead of mirroring the trees and mountains above, the river uses an abstract design of converging lines to suggest depth and movement. Unlike a realistic reflection, which would show inverted images of the terrain and vegetation, this version lacks any mirrored symmetry. The shapes and positions of the trees and mountains above do not appear duplicated below in reverse orientation. Thus, while the river creates a sense of space, it does not function as a reflective surface. The absence of true reflection means symmetry is not present, even though the scene is balanced in composition.",

      "question": "Are the color block boundaries crisp and clean, with no visible blurring, feathering, or pixelation at the edges of geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a vector-like or digital illustration style characterized by bold, flat color blocks. The edges between these blocks are sharp and well-defined, with no signs of blurring, feathering, or pixelation. Each shape—whether a mountain facet, tree silhouette, or sky stripe—has a clean boundary that separates it from adjacent areas. This precision suggests high-resolution rendering or digital creation techniques that prioritize clarity and definition. Such characteristics are typical of modern graphic design and stylized digital art, where crisp edges enhance the visual impact of geometric abstraction. Given the absence of soft transitions or artifacts, the color boundaries are indeed crisp and clean throughout the image.",
