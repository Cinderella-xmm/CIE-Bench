      "question": "Does the surface of the ballerina’s body show consistent marble texture with subtle chisel marks across all areas including arms, torso, legs, and face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is clearly a marble statue, as evidenced by its pale, veined stone appearance and classical sculptural style. The surface exhibits a smooth, polished finish typical of marble sculpture, with subtle variations in tone and texture that suggest natural stone characteristics. However, upon close inspection, there are no visible chisel marks—such as tooling lines or rough texturing—on the skin-like surfaces of the arms, torso, legs, or face. These areas appear unnaturally smooth for a carved statue, lacking the expected imperfections or deliberate textural details found in authentic ancient sculptures. While the overall form suggests a marble figure, the absence of chisel marks and the overly uniform surface imply digital rendering rather than physical carving. Therefore, the texture is inconsistent with realistic marble sculpture.",

      "question": "Are the folds and flow of the robe draped over the ballerina's body physically plausible and consistent with how heavy fabric would hang on a sculpted form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The drapery on the figure in Image B follows classical Greco-Roman sculptural conventions, where robes are rendered with flowing, dynamic folds. The fabric appears to drape naturally from the shoulders, cascading down the back and around the legs. The folds are deep and layered, suggesting weight and volume, which is consistent with how heavy fabric like wool or linen might behave when draped over a human form. However, the way the robe wraps around the left leg and foot appears somewhat rigid and less fluid, particularly near the ankle, where it seems to cling without natural sagging. Additionally, the right arm’s sleeve shows minimal movement despite the pose, which could be considered slightly implausible given the motion implied by the stance. Overall, while most of the draping is anatomically and physically reasonable, some minor inconsistencies exist in the lower limb area. Still, these deviations are within acceptable artistic interpretation for classical sculpture.",

      "question": "Is the laurel wreath positioned correctly on the head without distorting the skull shape or causing misalignment with facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The laurel wreath is placed on top of the head, resting along the crown and extending slightly toward the temples. It is composed of leaves arranged in a circular pattern, consistent with traditional Roman or Greek depictions of honorific crowns. The placement does not visibly distort the underlying skull structure; the contours of the head remain symmetrical and proportionate. There is no evidence of unnatural compression or bulging caused by the wreath. Furthermore, the wreath aligns well with the facial profile, even though the face is turned away, allowing for an accurate assessment of balance and positioning. In classical art, such wreaths are often depicted as resting lightly on the head without altering the anatomical form. This depiction adheres to those standards.",

      "question": "Do the feet retain proper human anatomy and alignment while appearing as carved stone, with no deformation or disproportionate elongation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feet of the statue are shown in profile, with one foot raised slightly forward, mimicking a walking or stepping pose. The toes are defined, and the arches of the feet are visible, maintaining basic human anatomical proportions. However, the heel of the raised foot appears disproportionately elongated and thickened, deviating from natural human foot structure. Moreover, the angle of the foot relative to the leg suggests a slight exaggeration in flexion, which may not reflect realistic biomechanics. While the overall form is still recognizable as a human foot, the proportions and articulation suggest some artistic stylization or digital manipulation. The stone material adds to the illusion of solidity, but the anatomical accuracy is compromised in key areas such as the heel and ankle joint.",

      "question": "Are the Ionic columns and mosaic floor aligned with the figure’s scale and perspective, showing no mismatch in depth or proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting includes a series of Ionic columns receding into the background, forming a colonnade typical of ancient Roman or Hellenistic architecture. The columns diminish in size appropriately as they extend into the distance, indicating correct linear perspective. The mosaic floor beneath the statue features geometric patterns that also converge toward a vanishing point, reinforcing depth perception. The scale of the columns relative to the statue appears consistent—each column is roughly three to four times the height of the figure, which is proportionally accurate for such architectural contexts. The spacing between columns and the width of the walkway are also consistent with historical examples. There is no visible distortion in foreshortening or scaling, and the lighting enhances the sense of spatial depth without introducing visual anomalies. Thus, the architectural elements are well-aligned with the figure in terms of scale and perspective.",
