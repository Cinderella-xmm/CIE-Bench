      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the kernel wearing autumn attire maintain consistent size and texture with real corn kernels, and does the clothing appear seamlessly integrated without visible edges or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kernel wearing autumn attire is depicted as a cartoon character with exaggerated features, which are not consistent in size or texture with real corn kernels. Real corn kernels are small and smooth, whereas this character has a large, rounded shape with visible clothing textures that do not match the natural appearance of corn. The clothing appears to be digitally added with clear edges, indicating it is not seamlessly integrated.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces smooth and consistent with the direction of motion, and do they avoid intersecting or distorting the popcorn shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The energy lines emanating from the popcorn pieces are stylized and dynamic, suggesting motion. They appear smooth and follow the direction of the popcorn's implied movement without intersecting or distorting the shapes of the popcorn. This design choice enhances the visual effect of motion while maintaining clarity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the popcorn piece with the explorer hat properly scaled and textured, and do the spices and pumpkin elements adjacent to it appear naturally positioned without overlapping distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The popcorn piece with the explorer hat is scaled appropriately for its context within the illustration and maintains a consistent texture with other popcorn pieces. The spices and pumpkin elements next to it are positioned naturally, without overlapping or distorting the popcorn shape, contributing to a cohesive and visually appealing composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a downward trajectory consistent with gravity, and do they remain within the bowl boundaries without appearing to float above or clip through the rim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The popcorn pieces entering the ceramic bowls follow a logical downward trajectory, consistent with the force of gravity. They are depicted as settling into the bowls without floating above or clipping through the rims, which aligns with realistic physical behavior and enhances the believability of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors of the added elements (such as hats, energy lines, and spices) consistent with the original orange-brown theme, and do they lack over-saturation or color bleeding at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors of the added elements such as hats, energy lines, and spices are harmonious with the orange-brown theme of the image. There is no evidence of over-saturation or color bleeding at the edges, ensuring that these elements blend well with the overall color scheme and maintain visual consistency.",
