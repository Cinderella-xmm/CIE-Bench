    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the two towers and the central wall of the fortress proportionally reduced without distortion or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two towers and the central wall appear to be scaled down versions of a larger structure. The proportions seem consistent with the original architecture, maintaining the same geometric shapes and structural integrity. There are no visible distortions or breaks in the lines that would suggest an improper scaling. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity of the windows, walls, and overall shape.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss covering the ground exhibit natural texture and color gradients, resembling real moss rather than a uniform or painted surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss in Image B shows variations in color and texture, which are typical characteristics of real moss. It has a mix of green shades and some areas appear denser than others, suggesting depth and natural growth patterns. This analysis is based on the visual cues of texture and color variation within the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the model knights positioned on the moss at a scale consistent with the miniature fortress, and do they rest fully on the ground without floating or intersecting with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The model knights in Image B are appropriately scaled relative to the miniature fortress. They are placed on the mossy ground and appear to be standing firmly, with no signs of floating or intersecting with other elements. Their positioning and size relative to the surrounding environment support this conclusion.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the faux stone pathways extend from the fortress base onto the moss with consistent texture and alignment, matching the original stonework without gaps or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pathways in Image B maintain a consistent texture and alignment as they extend from the fortress base onto the moss. They match the appearance of the stonework seen on the fortress itself, with no noticeable gaps or misalignments. This observation is based on the visual continuity of the pathway's design and its integration with the surrounding elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the glass star transparent and reflective, positioned precisely at the top of the central tower's spire without overlapping or deforming the underlying structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass star in Image B appears transparent and reflective, as it allows light to pass through while also reflecting some of the surroundings. It is positioned at the top of the central tower's spire, aligning well with the structure beneath it. There is no overlap or deformation visible, indicating precise placement.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the terrarium dome smoothly curved and transparent, enclosing the fortress without visible seams, warping, or optical distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The terrarium dome in Image B is smoothly curved and transparent, effectively enclosing the miniature fortress. There are no visible seams or warping, and the transparency does not introduce any significant optical distortions. This assessment is based on the dome's smooth appearance and how it interacts with the light and objects inside.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Does the wooden stand beneath the terrarium have visible wood grain, weathering, and design details consistent with vintage craftsmanship, and does it securely support the dome?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden stand in Image B displays visible wood grain and subtle signs of weathering, which are characteristic of vintage craftsmanship. The design details, such as the carved patterns, further enhance its antique appearance. Additionally, the stand appears sturdy and capable of securely supporting the dome, as there are no indications of instability or poor construction.",
