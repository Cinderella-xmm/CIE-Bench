      "question": "Does the themed box appear to have a natural industrial aesthetic without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box in Image B exhibits a dark, weathered metal finish with rivets, reinforced corners, and a leather-like handle, all of which contribute to an industrial aesthetic. The surface shows subtle wear patterns, scratches, and patina that mimic aged metal, consistent with real-world industrial equipment. There are no obvious digital artifacts such as pixelation, unnatural gloss, or repeating patterns that would suggest low-quality rendering. The texture appears consistent across the surface, with realistic lighting reflections and shadows indicating depth and material authenticity. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about industrial design and material aging, support the conclusion that the box has a natural industrial look.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and angles of the themed box in isometric perspective consistent and free from distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box is presented in a three-dimensional view with clear depth, suggesting an isometric or slightly angled perspective. The edges align properly, with parallel lines converging appropriately toward vanishing points, maintaining geometric consistency. The corners are sharp and symmetrical, and the internal compartments are evenly spaced and proportionally sized relative to the overall box dimensions. There is no visible warping, stretching, or misalignment that would indicate distortion. This alignment with principles of 3D perspective drawing and object scaling supports the conclusion that the proportions and angles are consistent and accurately rendered.",

      "question": "Do the bearings and components inside the box retain their fine details and appear precise without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bearings inside the box display distinct features such as individual rollers, raceways, and inner/outer rings. Each component is clearly defined with sharp edges and reflective surfaces that show accurate highlights and shadows, indicating high-resolution rendering. There is no blurring, pixelation, or smoothing that would suggest a loss of detail. The smallest bearing in the center compartment, for instance, still shows fine machining marks and consistent geometry. This level of precision is consistent with high-quality 3D modeling and rendering techniques used in technical visualization. Therefore, the components retain their fine details.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the metallic texture and intricate design of the primary bearing outside the box rendered photorealistically without any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary bearing outside the box is highly detailed, with visible ball bearings, grooves, and polished metallic surfaces. The reflection and specular highlights are smooth and follow the laws of light interaction with metal, showing no signs of over-sharpening, noise, or artificial patterns. The texture transitions naturally from matte to glossy areas, consistent with real steel or chrome-plated materials. The depth of field and shadowing around the bearing also enhance its realism. Given these visual cues and the absence of digital artifacts like aliasing or repetitive textures, the rendering can be considered photorealistic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the bearings and components arranged in an organized manner both inside and outside the box, contributing to visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the box, each bearing is placed within its own compartment, neatly aligned and spaced, which reflects a logical storage system typical of mechanical toolkits or precision parts kits. The arrangement suggests purposeful organization rather than random placement. Outside the box, the large bearing is positioned adjacent to it, appearing as if it has been removed for inspection or demonstration. This placement is natural and enhances the narrative of maintenance or assembly. The overall composition is clean, balanced, and coherent, supporting visual credibility in a technical or industrial context.",
