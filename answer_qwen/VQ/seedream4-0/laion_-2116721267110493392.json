      "question": "Do the cartoon versions of the two boys have proportionally correct head shapes and facial features that align with typical human anatomy, without exaggerated or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon versions of the two boys have heads and facial features that are stylized but not exaggerated or distorted in a way that would be considered unrealistic for cartoons. The proportions appear consistent with typical human anatomy as interpreted in animated styles, where slight exaggerations are common but still recognizable. This is analyzed by observing the overall head shape, eye placement, and other facial features which align with standard cartoon representations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements rendered with consistent material textures and lighting that match the surrounding environment, avoiding glossy or flat-painted artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cyan and lemon yellow furniture elements in Image B exhibit consistent material textures and lighting that match the surrounding environment. There are no glossy artifacts or flat-painted areas; instead, the colors and shading suggest a uniform material finish appropriate for a classroom setting. This conclusion is drawn from examining the smooth gradients and lack of unnatural highlights on the furniture surfaces.",

      "question": "Are the floating books and animated tablet screen positioned in a way that respects spatial depth and casting appropriate shadows, ensuring they appear physically plausible within the classroom setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating books and animated tablet screen in Image B are positioned to respect spatial depth, with shadows cast appropriately on nearby surfaces. These elements appear physically plausible within the classroom setting, suggesting careful consideration of light sources and object interactions. This analysis involves assessing the relative positions and shadowing of these objects compared to their surroundings.",

      "question": "Are the robots and gadgets placed at appropriate scales and distances from the children, with smooth surfaces and no visible digital artifacts like aliasing or missing textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robots and gadgets in Image B are placed at scales and distances that seem appropriate relative to the children, with smooth surfaces and no visible digital artifacts. The design avoids aliasing or missing textures, contributing to a cohesive visual presentation. This is determined by evaluating the size and surface quality of the robots and gadgets in relation to the rest of the scene.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text 'A Classroom Adventure' in Image B is clearly readable, positioned at the top without overlapping any critical elements. It is styled with clean lines and uniform thickness, matching the playful aesthetic of the image. This assessment is based on the legibility, placement, and stylistic consistency of the text with the overall design.",
