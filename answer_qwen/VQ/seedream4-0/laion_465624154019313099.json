      "question": "Are the eyes added to the cake positioned naturally on the surface without distorting the shape or texture of the meringue domes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake has been anthropomorphized with large cartoonish eyes placed on its surface. These eyes are clearly digital additions and not part of the original cake structure. The eyes are superimposed onto the meringue domes, which are small, rounded, and evenly spaced. However, the placement of the eyes does not align with the natural contours of the meringue domes; instead, they appear flat and artificially layered over the surface. This creates a visual distortion because the eyes do not conform to the three-dimensional curvature of the domes. In real-world terms, adding such features would require physical manipulation or sculpting, but here they are digitally inserted without regard for depth or texture consistency. Therefore, the eyes distort the appearance of the meringue domes by overriding their natural form.",

      "question": "Do the strawberries retain their original shape and size when repurposed as a hat, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a strawberry is used as a hat on the animated version of the cake character. While the strawberry appears whole and intact in shape, it has been digitally manipulated to sit atop the cake in a way that suggests it is part of a red hat-like structure. Upon close inspection, the strawberry's proportions seem slightly compressed or flattened at the base where it connects to the cake, indicating some degree of warping. Additionally, the stem and leaves are stylized and exaggerated, which deviates from the natural form of a strawberry. Real strawberries have a specific conical shape with a green calyx, but here the fruit is stretched and reshaped to fit the narrative of a 'hat,' altering its natural geometry. Thus, while recognizable, the strawberry is not preserved in its original form.",

      "question": "Are the faint silhouettes of utensils in the background visually consistent with the lighting and depth of the scene, without introducing harsh edges or unnatural shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel of the comic strip in Image B, there are faint silhouettes of utensils (spoon, fork, knife) in the background. These silhouettes are rendered in grayscale and lack detail, appearing as simple outlines against a lighter backdrop. The lighting in the scene is bright and even, suggesting an indoor kitchen environment. However, these silhouettes lack soft gradients or shadowing that would make them blend naturally into the depth of the scene. Instead, they appear as sharp, flat shapes with abrupt edges, which contrasts with the more realistic rendering of other elements like the cake and characters. In real-world visual perception, objects in the background should have softer focus and subtle shading due to depth and ambient light. The absence of such effects makes these silhouettes look artificial and disconnected from the overall lighting scheme, contributing to a sense of visual inconsistency.",

      "question": "Are the strawberries and garnishes arranged around the cake in a way that maintains structural balance and does not overlap or distort the cake’s base or side layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bottom panel shows the actual cake with two strawberries placed on top as decoration. There are no additional strawberries or garnishes arranged around the base of the cake. The cake rests on a white plate with crumbled nuts along the edge, which provides a border but does not interfere with the cake’s structure. The strawberries are centered on top and do not extend beyond the cake’s perimeter. Since there are no garnishes around the sides or base, there is no risk of overlapping or distorting the cake’s layers. The arrangement is minimal and symmetrical, maintaining structural integrity. Compared to the animated panels above, where strawberries are used creatively (e.g., as hats or armor), the real cake remains untouched and undistorted. Therefore, the physical arrangement in the lower image preserves balance and avoids interference with the cake’s form.",

      "question": "Does the depiction of the cake shaking its head maintain the rigidity of the cake’s structure without suggesting unnatural flexing or bending of the layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the animated portion of Image B, the cake character is shown shaking its head, which implies motion. However, cakes are solid food items composed of sponge, cream, and meringue layers, all of which are rigid and inflexible under normal conditions. The depiction of the cake moving its head involves a wobbling or swaying animation that suggests flexibility, particularly in the meringue domes and body. This movement contradicts the physical properties of baked goods, which cannot bend or shake without collapsing. In reality, such motion would cause structural failure—layers would separate, and the meringue would crack. The animation exaggerates this for comedic effect, but from a realistic standpoint, it introduces an illusion of elasticity that is inconsistent with the cake’s material composition. Thus, the depiction violates the expected rigidity of the cake.",
