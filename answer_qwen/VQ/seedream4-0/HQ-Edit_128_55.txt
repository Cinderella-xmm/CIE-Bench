    "Question": "Q1: Do the feathered wing extensions on the sides of the door maintain consistent wood grain and carving depth, with smooth transitions from the original panel edges?",
    "explanation": "The feathered wing extensions appear to be sculpted from a material that mimics feathers rather than wood. The texture is clearly different from the wooden door panels—feathers have a layered, organic structure, whereas the door has geometric carvings and visible wood grain. There is no continuity in wood grain or carving depth between the wings and the door; instead, the wings emerge as separate, three-dimensional elements attached to the door frame. The transition from the original panel edges is abrupt, not smooth, suggesting an intentional artistic addition rather than a seamless extension. This indicates a lack of consistency in material and depth, which would be expected if they were part of the original design.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the shimmering eyes formed from the iron studs aligned with their original positions and embedded within the wood without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "The 'eyes' are not formed from the original iron studs but are instead glowing orbs placed above the door, positioned where the owl's face emerges. These eyes are part of a larger sculptural owl head integrated into the top of the door, replacing the original archway’s upper section. The iron studs remain on the door below, arranged in rows as before, but the glowing eyes are superimposed over the area above the door, not embedded within the wood or derived from existing studs. They float slightly above the surface and do not align with any original stud placement. Their luminous quality suggests digital enhancement, and they overlap the architectural elements rather than being physically embedded. Therefore, they do not follow the original positioning or integration logic.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the celestial crown emerging from the arch maintain continuous curvature and seamless integration with the original arch shape, without broken lines or floating pieces?",
    "explanation": "The crown sits atop the arch but does not follow the curvature of the original arch seamlessly. Instead, it appears to be placed directly above the apex of the arch, creating a visual break in the architectural flow. The crown's base does not blend smoothly with the stone or carved arch—it stands out as a separate element with sharp edges and reflective surfaces that contrast with the matte finish of the surrounding stonework. Additionally, there are visible gaps between the crown and the arch, and the lighting suggests it is not structurally connected. The crown also emits star-like glows, indicating a digital or fantastical addition rather than a physical one. These features suggest discontinuity and lack of integration with the original structure.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the etched runes visible across the door’s surface consistent in depth, color, and lighting with the original carvings, and do they not cover or distort existing patterns?",
    "explanation": "The runes are vertically aligned along the central seam of the door and appear darker and more sharply defined than the original carvings. While the original door features intricate geometric patterns carved into the wood with consistent depth and warm brown tones, the runes have a deeper, almost black appearance with a slight metallic sheen, suggesting they were added digitally or with a different material. Furthermore, they overlay the existing patterns without blending into them—some of the original carvings are partially obscured or interrupted by the runes. The lighting on the runes is inconsistent with the rest of the door; they reflect light differently, appearing more pronounced and artificial. This indicates they were not part of the original design and do not integrate naturally with the existing craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the cloak-like structure around the doorframe exhibit natural fabric folds with consistent lighting and shadow, and does it maintain connection to the original stone frame without gaps or distortions?",
    "explanation": "The cloak-like drapery surrounding the doorframe appears to be a digitally rendered fabric, draped over the stone arch. While the folds are somewhat realistic, with soft shadows and highlights suggesting volume, there are inconsistencies in how the fabric interacts with the stone. The edges of the cloak do not fully conform to the contours of the stone frame—there are visible gaps and areas where the fabric seems to float slightly away from the structure. Additionally, the lighting on the fabric is uneven; some parts are overly bright while others are too dark, lacking the natural gradient seen in real cloth under ambient light. The fabric also appears to be suspended in mid-air at the top, without clear support, and the way it wraps around the owl sculpture feels forced rather than fluid. These issues indicate that while the cloak looks plausible at first glance, it lacks seamless integration with the original architecture.",
    "answer": "No"
