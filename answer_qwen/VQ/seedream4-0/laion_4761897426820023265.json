      "question": "Is the edge of the snow globe smooth and continuous, with no visible seams, distortions, or pixelation along its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edge of the snow globe in Image B appears to be smooth and continuous. The curvature of the glass sphere is consistent and uniform, with no visible breaks, seams, or jagged edges that would suggest digital artifacts or poor rendering. The lighting reflects evenly across the surface, indicating a seamless spherical shape. From a visual standpoint, there are no signs of pixelation or distortion along the boundary, which would typically appear as roughness or irregularities in texture. This suggests a high-quality rendering or photograph of a well-crafted snow globe. Based on common knowledge about real snow globes and their manufacturing, such smoothness is expected due to blow-molded or precision-cut glass. Therefore, the edge is visually consistent with a real-world object.",

      "question": "Are the reflections and refractions on the snow globe surface consistent with how light behaves on clear glass, showing subtle bending of the scene behind it and soft highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The reflections and refractions on the snow globe in Image B exhibit characteristics consistent with real glass optics. Light appears to bend slightly around the edges of the globe, creating a subtle warping effect on the background mountains—this is typical of refraction through a curved transparent medium. Soft highlights are visible on the surface, especially near the top and sides, where light interacts with the curved glass. Additionally, the interior scene is slightly distorted, appearing magnified and warped at the edges, which aligns with how light refracts through a spherical lens. These effects are realistic and match known physical behaviors of light interacting with glass spheres. There are no unnatural sharp lines or overly bright glares that would suggest digital overprocessing. Thus, the optical behavior depicted is consistent with real-world physics.",

      "question": "Do all visible figures inside the snow globe have complete and correctly proportioned limbs, with no extra fingers, missing arms, or distorted postures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, several miniature human figures are visible walking along the Great Wall. Upon close inspection, each figure has two arms and two legs, with limbs proportionate to their bodies. Their postures are natural—some appear to be walking forward, others standing—and there are no signs of extra fingers, missing limbs, or exaggerated distortions. The figures are small but clearly defined, with consistent proportions across all individuals. While they are stylized miniatures (as expected in a souvenir item), their anatomy remains within plausible limits for such scale models. No anomalies such as fused limbs or floating hands are present. Given the context of a manufactured collectible, this level of detail is typical and accurate.",

      "question": "Are the autumn-colored leaves integrated smoothly into the existing green vegetation, with no abrupt color changes or blocky textures indicating digital overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees within the snow globe display vibrant autumn colors—shades of orange, red, and yellow—contrasting with the surrounding greenery. However, upon closer analysis, the transition between these colors appears somewhat abrupt, particularly where orange-red clusters meet the green base foliage. Some tree canopies show uniform, almost painted-like patches of color rather than gradual blending, suggesting digital enhancement or modeling rather than organic growth patterns. Additionally, the texture of the autumn leaves lacks fine detail and shows slight pixelation or flatness, especially when compared to the more natural-looking green vegetation outside the globe. These traits indicate possible digital overlay or 3D rendering artifacts. In reality, autumn foliage transitions gradually and exhibits variation in tone and texture, which is not fully replicated here. Therefore, while the colors are vivid, the integration is not entirely smooth or natural.",

      "question": "Are the snow particles visible throughout the globe in a dynamic, swirling pattern, and do they not fully cover the Great Wall or figures, allowing them to remain clearly visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Snow particles inside the globe are indeed visible and arranged in a swirling, dynamic pattern, suggesting motion—consistent with how snowflakes behave in a shaken snow globe. They are distributed throughout the interior space but do not obscure the main elements like the Great Wall or the tiny human figures. The structures and people remain clearly visible beneath the falling snow, with only minor partial coverage by individual flakes. This balance allows for aesthetic appeal without losing clarity of the central scene. The particles appear to float naturally, enhancing the illusion of movement without overwhelming the view. This matches both real snow globes and artistic expectations for such objects, where visibility is preserved despite the presence of moving elements.",

      "question": "Are the ceramic birds clearly distinguishable as small flying objects with defined wings and bodies, and are they located in the air above the Wall without touching any surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The birds inside the snow globe are small, white with blue wingtips, and positioned mid-air above the Great Wall structure. Each bird has clearly defined wings and a body, resembling seagulls or similar species. They are suspended in the air, not resting on any part of the wall, trees, or ground, and appear to be in flight. Their placement is consistent with natural flight paths above the landscape. There is no indication of them touching any surface, and their positioning adds to the sense of depth and realism within the scene. Given that snow globes often include decorative flying elements, these birds are rendered plausibly and functionally as intended. Their form and location are consistent with both artistic design and physical feasibility.",

      "question": "Is the wooden base dark in color, textured with realistic grain, and does it support the snow globe without floating or tilting, with the engraved text clearly legible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base of the snow globe is dark brown, exhibiting a polished finish with visible wood grain patterns that suggest realism. The texture appears consistent with high-quality hardwood, and the base is solidly supporting the globe without any sign of floating or tilting—there is a clear shadow underneath, indicating proper contact with the surface. The engraved text 'Great Wall Memories' is clearly legible, with even lettering and golden coloring that stands out against the dark wood. The font style is clean and appropriate for a souvenir item. Overall, the base functions both structurally and aesthetically, matching expectations for a premium collectible. There are no visual cues suggesting digital manipulation or instability.",
