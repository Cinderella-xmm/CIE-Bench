      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style character maintain natural proportions without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B is rendered in a chibi (super-deformed) art style, which inherently features exaggerated proportions such as a large head relative to the body, small limbs, and simplified facial features. These are stylistic choices common in anime and toy design, not distortions. The geometric shapes of the character—such as the rounded head, cylindrical limbs, and symmetrical torso—are consistent with 3D modeling standards for stylized figures. There are no broken edges, unnatural angles, or malformed components that would suggest a technical error in rendering. While the proportions are not realistic, they are coherent within the intended artistic style. Therefore, the character maintains consistent and intentional proportions appropriate for its genre.",

      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the red xiuhe wedding dress with golden embroidery natural and free of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red xiuhe dress in Image B displays rich, high-resolution textures with intricate golden embroidery featuring phoenixes, floral patterns, and traditional Chinese motifs. The fabric appears smooth with a satin-like sheen, consistent with the luxurious nature of a wedding gown. The embroidery has clear outlines, consistent shading, and depth, suggesting careful digital rendering. There are no visible pixelation, texture repetition, or clipping artifacts. The lighting reflects realistically on the fabric, enhancing the perception of material quality. Given that this is a stylized 3D model, some idealization is expected, but the overall appearance remains visually convincing and artifact-free.",

      "question": "Do the phoenix crown and its embellishments appear naturally attached to the character's head without any visual inconsistencies or unnatural placements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The phoenix crown is intricately designed with golden filigree, red flowers, tassels, and hanging ornaments. It sits atop the character’s head in a balanced and symmetrical manner. The crown’s base appears to integrate seamlessly with the hairline, and the decorative elements extend outward without intersecting or floating unnaturally. The tassels hang downward with proper physics, and the floral accents align with the curvature of the head. No gaps, misalignments, or clipping issues are visible between the crown and the hair. This suggests a well-executed 3D model where the accessories are properly rigged and positioned, maintaining visual coherence.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the 3D chibi-style character and the “囍” paper-cut backdrop seamless and visually plausible without any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background features a large red '囍' (double happiness) paper-cut decoration mounted on a wall. The character is seated in front of it, and the lighting and shadows suggest a consistent light source from above. The edges of the character do not show haloing, sharp clipping, or color bleeding into the background, indicating a clean compositing job. The depth of field is subtle but effective, with the backdrop slightly blurred, enhancing the sense of space. The shadow cast by the character onto the ground matches the lighting direction and falls naturally. There are no visible seams, transparency errors, or digital artifacts at the boundary between the character and the environment, making the integration visually plausible.",

      "question": "Do the character's hands holding the phone retain a natural appearance with correct finger numbers and ergonomic shapes, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's hands are stylized but maintain five fingers per hand, correctly aligned and proportioned for a chibi figure. The fingers are slightly curved around the smartphone in a natural grip, with thumb and index finger positions typical for texting. Although the hands are simplified compared to real human anatomy, they avoid exaggerated deformities such as extra fingers, fused digits, or incorrect joint placement. The ergonomics of the grip are plausible for a character using a phone. No visible warping, stretching, or missing segments are present. Given the artistic style, minor simplifications are acceptable, but the overall structure remains anatomically coherent within the context of the design.",
