      "question": "Does the added poem text blend naturally with the image without causing any visible distortion to the background or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The poem text is placed at the bottom of the image, which does not overlap with the bird or branch. The transparency and color of the text are chosen in such a way that it complements the background without distorting the visual elements of the bird or the natural setting. There are no visible artifacts or distortions around the text that would suggest it disrupts the original image.",

      "question": "Does the poem text appear in a position that does not obscure important elements like the bird or branch, ensuring structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text is positioned at the lower part of the image, away from the central focus on the bird and the branch it perches on. This placement ensures that the bird and branch remain clearly visible and unobscured, maintaining the structural integrity and focus of the image.",

      "question": "Is the font and size of the added poem text appropriate, maintaining readability while not overpowering the natural elements of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The font used for the poem text is simple and clean, which enhances readability. The size of the text is moderate; it is large enough to be read easily but small enough not to dominate the scene. It strikes a balance between being noticeable and not overpowering the natural beauty of the bird and its surroundings.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The poem text appears to have a smooth texture with soft edges, which helps it blend into the image's overall aesthetic. The lighting and shadow effects in the text match the ambient light of the image, preventing any harsh contrasts or unnatural artifacts that could detract from the scene.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the poem text at the bottom of the image contributes to a balanced composition. It adds an element of narrative without disrupting the natural feel of the scene. The harmony between the text and the visual elements suggests careful consideration in the design process to ensure that all components work together cohesively.",
