      "question": "Does the 3D voxel-style model of the mouse retain a natural texture similar to the original mouse's fur without any obvious unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D voxel-style model of the mouse is constructed from blocky, cubic elements typical of voxel art, which inherently lacks the fine, continuous texture of real fur. Instead of soft, flowing fur, the model uses distinct blocks to simulate color and form, resulting in a pixelated, geometric appearance. This style is fundamentally different from natural fur texture, which consists of fine, overlapping strands with subtle variations in color and direction. The visual cues in Image B clearly show that the surface is made of uniform, angular blocks rather than a soft, organic texture. Therefore, the model does not retain a natural fur texture but instead presents a stylized, artificial one.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the mouse's body parts in the 3D voxel-style model consistent with its original form, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the voxel-style mouse maintains overall anatomical proportions consistent with a real mouse—such as a rounded body, small head, large ears, and short legs. Despite being composed of cubic blocks, the relative sizes and placements of these body parts align with biological accuracy. For example, the head is appropriately sized compared to the body, the ears are positioned correctly on top of the head, and the limbs are proportionate. While the blocky nature introduces some simplification, there is no evident distortion or deformation that compromises the structural integrity or realism of the animal’s form. The model preserves the essential silhouette and spatial relationships seen in real mice, indicating that the physical rationality has been maintained within the constraints of the voxel art style.",

      "question": "Do the edges and surfaces of the 3D voxel-style mouse model appear smooth and coherent, without any jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The voxel-style model in Image B is built from discrete cubes, which naturally results in stepped or faceted edges rather than smooth curves. While this is an expected characteristic of voxel art, the model appears coherent and well-constructed, with no visible gaps, misaligned blocks, or broken geometry. The transitions between different colored blocks (e.g., brown for the back, white for the belly) are clean and deliberate, maintaining structural continuity. Although the edges are not smooth in the traditional sense—due to the inherent blockiness of the medium—they are consistent and intact. Thus, while not smooth in a photorealistic way, the model avoids jaggedness or fragmentation, ensuring a stable and visually coherent structure.",

      "question": "Does the interaction between the 3D voxel-style mouse model and the smartphone look plausible and realistic, without any unnatural positioning or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the voxel mouse is placed adjacent to the smartphone on a wooden surface, mirroring the setup in Image A. The positioning appears plausible—the mouse is near the phone, facing it, as if inspecting it. However, the lighting and shadows suggest a stylized rendering rather than a physically accurate simulation. The shadow beneath the mouse is simplified and somewhat flat, lacking the soft gradients and depth typically seen in real-world lighting. Additionally, the phone itself is also rendered in a voxel style, which affects the perceived realism of the interaction. While the placement is logical and consistent with the original scene, the overall rendering lacks photorealistic depth and shadow detail, making the interaction feel more like a digital composition than a natural occurrence. Therefore, while the positioning is reasonable, the visual realism of the interaction is compromised by the stylized rendering.",

      "question": "Are the fine details of the mouse's features, such as whiskers and eyes, preserved in the 3D voxel-style model without any loss or degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The voxel-style model includes representations of key features such as the eyes, whiskers, and ears. The eyes are depicted as black blocks with minimal detail, capturing their position and general shape but lacking the reflective quality and depth of real eyes. The whiskers are represented by thin, elongated white blocks extending from the snout, preserving their directional orientation and number. However, due to the blocky nature of voxel art, these details are highly simplified and lack the fine, delicate structure seen in the original mouse. For instance, real whiskers are slender and flexible, whereas the voxel version is rigid and segmented. Similarly, the eyes are reduced to simple cubes without pupils or shine. While the presence of these features is preserved, their fidelity and complexity are significantly degraded compared to the original. Therefore, the fine details are not fully preserved in terms of realism or intricacy.",
