      "question": "Does the silver-gray fabric on the blade retain the original blade's curved shape and pattern details without distortion or loss of fine lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blade is made of fabric with a silver-gray base and black embroidered patterns. The overall curvature of the blade matches that of a traditional curved dagger, suggesting it retains the general shape of the original blade. However, upon closer inspection, the embroidered patterns appear simplified and less intricate compared to typical engraved metalwork seen in historical blades. The fine lines of the original engraving (as seen in Image A) are replaced by broader, stitched motifs that lack the precision and density of the original. This indicates a loss of detail due to the medium change from metal to fabric. While the curve is preserved, the fine line fidelity is compromised. Therefore, the pattern details are not fully retained.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the hilt smoothly rounded and consistent in curvature, without abrupt flattening or irregular bulges suggesting poor volume shaping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hilt in Image B appears to be made of soft, padded material, likely plush or felt, giving it a three-dimensional form. The edges are uniformly rounded and follow a smooth, continuous curve from the pommel to the guard. There are no visible abrupt flattening or irregular bulges; the volume seems evenly distributed, indicating careful construction. The soft material allows for a gentle contouring that mimics the ergonomic shape of a real hilt. Compared to Image A, where the hilt is rigid and segmented with a natural bone-like texture, this version is softer but still maintains a consistent curvature. Thus, the shaping appears well-executed despite the material difference.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the blade’s tip preserved as a pointed, slightly curved end without drooping or flattening due to over-stuffing or under-support?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tip of the blade in Image B is clearly defined and ends in a pointed, slightly curved shape, consistent with the original blade’s silhouette. There is no visible drooping or flattening at the tip, which would suggest either insufficient internal support or excessive stuffing. The fabric appears taut and well-structured, maintaining the intended form. In contrast to Image A, where the metal tip is sharply defined and rigid, the fabric version replicates the same pointed curvature without deformation. This suggests proper internal support was used during construction. Hence, the tip is preserved accurately.",

      "question": "Are the black embroidered patterns uniformly spaced and aligned along the blade’s length, matching the original engraving’s density and symmetry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black embroidery on the blade in Image B follows a repeating pattern of floral or geometric motifs, similar in style to the engraved designs on the original blade in Image A. However, the spacing between the motifs is inconsistent—some areas have denser stitching while others are more sparse. Additionally, the alignment is not perfectly symmetrical; the patterns shift slightly along the blade’s length, especially near the middle and tip. In comparison, the original blade features highly detailed, uniform, and symmetrically arranged engravings with precise repetition. The embroidered version, while stylistically inspired, lacks the precision and consistency of the original. Therefore, the patterns are not uniformly spaced or aligned.",

      "question": "Is the background a consistent, flat solid color without visible gradients, shadows, or texture that could imply improper rendering or compositing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a light gray or off-white surface that appears uniformly lit. There are no visible gradients, harsh shadows, or textural inconsistencies that would suggest poor lighting or digital compositing artifacts. The surface is smooth and even across the entire frame, providing a neutral backdrop that does not distract from the object. This is consistent with professional product photography standards, where a clean, flat background is used to highlight the subject. There is no evidence of digital manipulation or rendering flaws. Therefore, the background is properly rendered.",
