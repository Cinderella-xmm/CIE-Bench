      "question": "Does the bodice and skirt exhibit natural fabric folds and draping consistent with the weight and volume of Victorian-era garments, especially at the waist and hip regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bodice in Image B is structured with a corset-like silhouette, typical of Victorian fashion, featuring tight lacing and defined shaping around the waist. The fabric appears to be a heavy satin or similar material, which would naturally create pronounced folds and creases under gravity, particularly where it meets the fullness of the skirt. At the waist, the transition from the fitted bodice to the voluminous skirt shows a clear gathering, consistent with historical garment construction using petticoats or crinolines beneath. The skirt itself has soft, cascading folds that radiate outward from the waist, suggesting appropriate weight distribution and draping. These visual cues—such as the vertical tension lines in the bodice and the radial flow of the skirt—are consistent with how heavy fabrics behave when worn in period-appropriate styles. There are no unnatural distortions or flat areas that would suggest digital manipulation or lack of physical realism.",

      "question": "Is the floral pattern on the skirt evenly distributed without visible repetition, pixelation, or color shifts that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral pattern on the skirt in Image B features large, detailed rose motifs with accompanying leaves, arranged in a seemingly organic layout across the fabric. Upon close inspection, the pattern does not show obvious repeating blocks or tile-like alignment, which could indicate digital replication. The colors appear consistent throughout, with subtle shading variations that mimic hand-painted or printed textiles. There is no visible pixelation or jagged edges along the floral outlines, suggesting high-resolution rendering. Additionally, the gradient transitions between petals and background are smooth, lacking the sharp contrast or banding sometimes seen in low-quality digital overlays. Given the clarity and continuity of the pattern, it appears to be either a high-quality photograph of an actual garment or a very well-executed digital recreation with attention to texture detail.",

      "question": "Do the lace gloves fit the hands naturally, showing five fingers per hand with correct joint alignment and no stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lace gloves in Image B cover the hands up to the wrist and feature delicate finger openings. Each hand clearly displays five distinct fingers, with proper spacing and curvature matching anatomical proportions. The joints at the knuckles and fingertips appear aligned correctly, and there is no visible distortion such as elongated fingers or unnatural bending. The lace material conforms closely to the hand's shape without signs of stretching or compression, indicating realistic fitting. The transparency of the lace allows for visibility of the underlying hand structure, further enhancing the illusion of natural wear. No warping or digital artifacts are evident in the glove’s edge or mesh pattern, supporting the conclusion that the gloves are properly rendered.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the subject cleanly blended into the new garden background without visible seams, ghosting, or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the subject is placed against a lush garden backdrop with vibrant flowers, greenery, and a wrought-iron bench. The edges of the figure—particularly around the hairline, shoulders, sleeves, and hem of the dress—are sharply defined yet smoothly integrated into the environment. There are no visible halos, double outlines, or transparent pixels that would suggest poor compositing. Shadows cast by the subject onto the ground and bench align with the lighting direction (from above and slightly to the side), reinforcing depth and grounding. Additionally, the interaction between the subject's clothing and surrounding elements (e.g., the way the skirt drapes near the bench) appears physically plausible. This level of integration suggests professional-grade editing techniques were used to blend the subject seamlessly into the scene.",

      "question": "Do the pearl choker and earrings cast appropriate shadows on the neck and ear, and do the pearls show consistent size, spacing, and reflective highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pearl choker and earrings in Image B are depicted with multiple spherical beads arranged in neat rows. The pearls have uniform size and spacing, with each bead reflecting light consistently—showing small, bright specular highlights indicative of glossy surfaces. The shadows cast by the choker on the neck are soft and follow the contour of the skin, consistent with diffuse lighting from overhead. Similarly, the earring casts a subtle shadow behind the earlobe, aligning with the light source. The reflection patterns on the pearls are coherent and match the ambient lighting conditions of the outdoor setting. There is no irregularity in bead shape or glow that would suggest digital over-processing. Overall, the rendering of the jewelry adheres to principles of realistic material behavior and lighting physics.",
