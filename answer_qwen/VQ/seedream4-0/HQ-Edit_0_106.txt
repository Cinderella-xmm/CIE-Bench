    "Question": "Q1: Does the lion’s silhouette maintain correct anatomical proportions and smooth edge definition without visible pixelation or geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "The lion's silhouette in Image B is rendered as a solid black shape against a lighter background. Upon close inspection, the outline of the lion appears clean and continuous, with no jagged edges or stair-step artifacts that would indicate pixelation. The form of the lion—its head, mane, body, legs, and tail—is proportionally consistent with real lion anatomy. The mane is thick and voluminous, and the body structure reflects typical feline musculature and stance. There are no signs of geometric distortion such as warped limbs or unnatural curvature. The silhouette maintains a natural flow, suggesting high-quality vector or digital rendering. Based on visual cues and world knowledge of lion anatomy, the silhouette accurately represents a lion in profile, walking forward, with appropriate proportions and smooth edges.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the color transitions in the abstract gradient backdrop smooth and free from visible banding or unnatural color boundaries?",
    "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B features a grayscale gradient transitioning from white at the top-left to dark gray at the bottom-right. The transition appears smooth and gradual, with no visible bands or abrupt shifts in tone. This suggests a high-resolution gradient without compression artifacts or dithering. In digital design, such gradients are often created using mathematical interpolation to ensure smoothness. The absence of stepped tones or halftone patterns indicates that the gradient was likely generated with proper anti-aliasing and color blending techniques. From a visual standpoint, the gradient enhances the depth of the scene without introducing any distracting elements. Given the clarity and continuity of the tonal shift, it can be concluded that the color transitions are smooth and free from banding.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the grass textures in the foreground appear naturally lit and spatially coherent with the rest of the scene, without repeating patterns or artificial sharpness?",
    "explanation": "The grass in the foreground of Image B is depicted as a dense, black silhouette with fine, vertical lines representing individual blades. While this is a stylized representation rather than photorealistic, the texture appears consistent and non-repetitive across the field. The blades vary slightly in length and angle, contributing to a sense of natural randomness. The lighting effect is implied by the contrast between the dark grass and the lighter background, suggesting illumination from behind (backlighting), which is consistent with the silhouette style. There is no evidence of tiling or obvious pattern repetition, nor does the texture exhibit artificial sharpness or over-enhancement. However, due to the monochromatic nature and stylized approach, the 'natural lighting' is more interpretive than literal. Nevertheless, within the context of the artistic style, the grass texture is spatially coherent and visually plausible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the angular acacia tree silhouettes structurally plausible and visually balanced within the composition, without broken branches or unnatural angles?",
    "explanation": "The acacia trees in Image B are stylized silhouettes with flat-topped canopies and branching structures typical of African acacias. While simplified, their forms retain recognizable features such as wide crowns and sparse, spreading branches. The trees are positioned at varying distances and angles, creating depth and balance in the composition. There are no visible broken branches or impossible angles; each tree maintains a structural coherence that aligns with known acacia morphology. The angularity of the branches may be exaggerated for stylistic effect, but this does not compromise plausibility in a symbolic or graphic context. The overall arrangement supports the theme of a savanna landscape without introducing visual inconsistencies. Therefore, the silhouettes are both structurally plausible and compositionally balanced.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the title text positioned above the lion without overlapping its head or body, and does it maintain legible contrast without introducing visual noise or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The title 'King of the Wild' is placed in the upper portion of Image B, clearly above the lion’s head and well separated from its silhouette. The text is centered horizontally and does not intersect with any part of the lion, ensuring full visibility of both the text and the animal. The font is bold and sans-serif, providing strong contrast against the light background, which enhances readability. There is no blurring, distortion, or visual noise associated with the text. The spacing between letters and lines is even, and the alignment is precise. The use of black text on a white-to-gray gradient ensures high legibility without introducing glare or interference. Thus, the placement and presentation of the text are effective and professionally executed.",
    "answer": "Yes"
