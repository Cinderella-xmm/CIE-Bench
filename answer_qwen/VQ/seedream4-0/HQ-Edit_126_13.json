      "question": "Do the annotated lines representing the tea journey follow a smooth, non-intersecting path around the tea set without overlapping or deforming the original objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The annotated lines in Image B form a circular flow that traces the steps of the tea journey, starting from the teapot and moving clockwise around the tea set. The line is drawn in a soft green hue and appears to be digitally added as a guide for the viewer. It avoids intersecting with itself and maintains consistent spacing from the objects. The path curves gently around the teapot, cup, chopsticks, and vase, ensuring it does not overlap or obscure any key elements. Importantly, none of the original objects—such as the teapot, cup, or chopsticks—are distorted or altered in shape due to the overlay. The line remains translucent and thin enough to avoid visual interference. Based on this observation and common design principles for annotations (which favor clarity and minimal obstruction), the path is well-planned and follows a smooth, non-intersecting trajectory.",

      "question": "Is the handwritten calligraphy in soft pastel green seamlessly integrated into the scene without causing visual contrast or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwritten text in Image B is rendered in a soft pastel green color, which harmonizes with the natural tones of the scene—especially the pink blossoms and beige tablecloth. The font style mimics a delicate brush script, fitting the Zen aesthetic of the tea ceremony setting. While the text is legible, its transparency and light saturation prevent it from dominating the visual field. However, upon close inspection, there are subtle pixelation artifacts along the edges of some letters, particularly near 'Bippling for water poured' and 'Bonping umindfulness,' indicating minor digital rendering imperfections. These do not significantly disrupt the overall harmony but suggest slight texture artifacts. Additionally, the contrast between the text and the background is low, which helps integration but may reduce readability in some areas. Despite these minor issues, the overall effect remains gentle and contextually appropriate.",

      "question": "Are the minimalist icons for each step of the tea journey proportionally scaled and visually coherent with the surrounding objects and layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minimalist icons in Image B include a leaf symbolizing 'Tea leaves harvested,' a meditative figure for 'Meditative focus,' and a stylized branch for 'Sicoms symbolize tranquility.' These icons are small, simple, and placed at strategic points along the annotated path. Their size is consistent relative to the text and other elements, avoiding dominance over the scene. The leaf icon is proportionate to the nearby teapot and matches the botanical theme. The meditative figure is appropriately sized and positioned near the bottom-left corner, where it doesn't interfere with the chopsticks or table edge. The floral branch icon aligns with the cherry blossom motif. All icons maintain a flat, clean design that complements the minimalist aesthetic. There is no visible scaling inconsistency or distortion, and they appear to be thoughtfully placed to support the narrative without disrupting the visual balance. Thus, they are proportionally scaled and visually coherent.",

      "question": "Do the added cherry blossom petals appear to float or fall naturally in the air without unnatural positioning or missing shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several cherry blossom petals are depicted mid-air, suggesting a gentle drift downward. The petals are scattered across the upper portion of the image, with some closer to the vase and others further away, creating a sense of depth. Their orientation varies slightly, which adds realism. However, upon closer inspection, many of the petals lack subtle shadows or depth cues that would indicate interaction with light and the environment. For instance, petals floating above the table mat do not cast faint shadows, which would be expected given the lighting direction from the top-left. Additionally, some petals appear perfectly aligned or uniformly spaced, lacking the randomness of natural motion. This suggests they were digitally inserted without full consideration of physics or lighting consistency. Therefore, while the concept is aesthetically pleasing, the execution lacks naturalism in terms of shadow and positioning.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase preserved without visible distortion, blurring, or artificial seams where new elements were added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures of the table mat, teapot, cup, and vase in Image B appear largely consistent with their counterparts in the original scene. The woven pattern of the table mat is clearly visible and retains its detail. The teapot’s textured surface, resembling traditional cast iron, shows no signs of blurring or warping. Similarly, the cup and vase maintain their matte finish and fine grain, with no apparent digital artifacts. The addition of annotations, text, and icons does not seem to have overlaid or obscured these textures. Notably, the bamboo tray under the teapot in Image B has been replaced with a more detailed version, but this change appears intentional and stylistically coherent. There are no visible seams, ghosting, or blending errors where new elements (like the text or icons) meet the original objects. This indicates careful digital editing that preserved the integrity of the original textures.",
