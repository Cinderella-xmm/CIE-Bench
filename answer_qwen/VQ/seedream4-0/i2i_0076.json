      "question": "Does the word \"warm\" blend seamlessly into the top left corner without disrupting the natural appearance and introducing any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'warm' is placed in the top left corner with a clean, white font that contrasts subtly against the lighter background of the wall. The font size and style are minimalistic, which helps it blend into the space without introducing any unnatural textures or disrupting the natural appearance of the room. There are no visible artifacts or distortions around the text that would suggest an unnatural integration.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Has the addition of the word \"warm\" at the top left corner maintained the structural consistency of surrounding elements like the sofa and cushions, avoiding any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sofa and cushions remain visually consistent and undistorted despite the addition of the word 'warm'. The placement of the text does not overlap or interfere with the structural elements of the sofa, maintaining its integrity. The surrounding area of the sofa appears unaffected by the text, indicating that the structural consistency has been maintained.",

      "question": "Does the size and font of the word \"warm\" maintain visual plausibility and authentic integration with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The size and font of the word 'warm' appear to be carefully chosen to maintain visual plausibility. It is neither too large nor too small, ensuring it complements the image rather than dominates it. The font style is simple and matches the overall aesthetic of the room, contributing to an authentic integration with the rest of the image.",

      "question": "Is the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner added in a manner that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The word 'freedom' at the bottom right corner is added in a way that preserves the fine details of the floor and plant. The text does not obscure or alter the texture of the rug or the base of the plant pot. There are no visible artifacts or loss of detail around the text, suggesting that it has been integrated smoothly into the image.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the placement of the word \"freedom\" at the bottom right corner respect the structural integrity of nearby elements, such as the corner of the rug and plant pot base, without causing any visible distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of the word 'freedom' respects the structural integrity of nearby elements such as the corner of the rug and the plant pot base. The text does not cause any visible distortion or disruption to these elements, and their shapes and positions remain intact. This indicates that the placement has been done thoughtfully to avoid interference with the existing structures.",
