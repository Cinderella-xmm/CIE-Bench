    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The top hat appears to sit naturally on the capybara's head. There are no visible seams or texture mismatches that would suggest distortion. The hat conforms well to the shape of the head, and there is a smooth transition between the fur and the hat material. This conclusion is drawn by observing the natural flow of the fur around the hat and the absence of any unnatural breaks or overlaps.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The teacup held by the capybara’s front paws is at a natural angle and scale. It does not appear deformed or floating; instead, it looks as if it is being held securely. The size of the teacup relative to the capybara’s paws seems appropriate, and there is no indication of graphical errors such as misalignment or distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The suit worn by the capybara exhibits consistent fabric texture and natural draping. The seam lines follow the contours of the animal’s body appropriately, suggesting careful attention to detail in the rendering. The suit fits well, with no signs of stretching or unnatural folds that would indicate poor texture mapping or modeling.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The monocle is positioned properly over the capybara’s eye without overlapping the fur unnaturally. There are no visible rendering artifacts like ghosting or misalignment. The monocle appears to be integrated seamlessly into the image, maintaining the integrity of the fur texture around it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The London riverscape background aligns well with the lighting and time of day depicted in the scene. Architectural elements like Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament appear proportionally correct and spatially coherent. The lighting suggests a similar time of day as the foreground subject, and the perspective of the buildings matches the expected view from the location implied by the railing and river.",
    "answer": "Yes"
