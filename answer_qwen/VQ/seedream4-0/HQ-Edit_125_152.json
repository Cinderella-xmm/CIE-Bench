      "question": "Are the sheet music patterns integrated into the wingâ€™s orange sections without breaking the natural vein lines or causing visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sheet music patterns are integrated into the butterfly's wings. Observing the orange sections of the wings, the musical notes and staff lines appear to be seamlessly blended with the natural vein lines of the wing. There are no visible texture artifacts or disruptions in the pattern that would suggest a break in the design. The integration seems smooth, maintaining the aesthetic integrity of the wing's appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the antennae extend from the head in a smooth, continuous curve without unnatural kinks, breaks, or disproportionate length?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antennae in Image B extend from the butterfly's head in a manner that appears smooth and continuous. There are no abrupt kinks or breaks in their curvature, and their length seems proportionate relative to the size of the butterfly. This observation aligns with common representations of butterfly antennae, which typically exhibit a gentle curve without irregularities.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the petal shapes of the newly added flowers formed like musical notes but still maintain natural curvature and thickness consistent with real petals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The newly added flowers in Image B have petals shaped like musical notes. While these petals maintain a certain level of curvature consistent with real petals, they also clearly represent musical notes, which is an artistic choice rather than a natural form. However, the thickness and curvature do not seem unnatural for stylized floral art, balancing between the concept of musical notes and petal-like forms.",

      "question": "Are the butterfly and surrounding flowers arranged in a balanced circular pattern where each element appears at a plausible distance and angle relative to the others?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly and surrounding flowers are arranged in a visually balanced circular pattern. Each element, including the butterfly and various flowers, appears at plausible distances and angles relative to one another, creating a harmonious composition. This arrangement enhances the overall symmetry and visual appeal of the image.",

      "question": "Is the title text rendered with smooth, continuous strokes and no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title text 'Monarch's Garden Symphony' in Image B is rendered with smooth, continuous strokes. Upon close inspection, there are no visible aliasing or jagged edges along the letterforms, indicating high-quality rendering. The text appears crisp and well-defined, contributing to the polished look of the image.",
