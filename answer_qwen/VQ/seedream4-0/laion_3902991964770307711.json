      "question": "Do the top portions of the candelabra now appear as transparent, tapered glass caps with realistic light behavior and smooth contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top portions of the candelabra are clearly visible as transparent, tapered glass caps. The light behavior is realistic, with reflections and refractions that suggest a polished glass material. The contours are smooth, indicating a high-quality finish. This analysis is based on observing the transparency, light interaction, and shape of the caps.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the arms and central shaft replaced with smooth, uninterrupted gold-finish tubing that reflects light consistently and lacks visible seams or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms and central shaft in Image B appear to be made of smooth gold-finish tubing. There are no visible seams or breaks, and the reflection of light is consistent across the surface, suggesting a seamless design. This conclusion is drawn from examining the uniformity and reflective properties of the tubing.",

      "question": "Is the brand logo embossed on the base such that it blends naturally with the surrounding texture and does not introduce irregular depth or lighting anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand logo embossed on the base in Image B blends naturally with the surrounding texture. There are no irregularities in depth or lighting anomalies around the logo, which suggests a well-integrated design. This assessment is based on the visual consistency of the embossing with the rest of the base's surface.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the floral-engraved patterns evenly distributed, following the contours of the candelabra without flattening, repeating unnaturally, or appearing as surface overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral-engraved patterns on the base in Image B are evenly distributed and follow the contours of the candelabra smoothly. They do not appear flattened, repeated unnaturally, or overlaid on the surface, indicating a natural integration into the design. This evaluation is based on the pattern's alignment and visual flow with the base's shape.",

      "question": "Does the script font label on the central tube follow the curvature of the tube naturally, without warping, stretching, or overlapping with other surface details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The script font label on the central tube in Image B follows the curvature of the tube naturally. There is no warping, stretching, or overlapping with other details, which indicates a well-executed application of the text. This conclusion is reached by observing how the text aligns with the cylindrical shape of the tube.",
