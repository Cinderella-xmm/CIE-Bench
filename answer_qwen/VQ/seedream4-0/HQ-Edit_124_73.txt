    "Question": "Q1: Are the floral motifs added to the elephant’s skin consistent in texture and scale with surrounding natural elements, and do they avoid pixelation, blurring, or unnatural edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the floral motifs painted on the elephant’s skin are stylized and decorative, featuring flowers such as roses and marigolds in a symmetrical pattern along the trunk and ears. These motifs are rendered with fine lines and delicate shading, consistent with traditional Indian miniature painting styles. The scale of the flowers is proportionate to the size of the elephant's features—neither overly large nor tiny—and they appear integrated into the surface rather than superimposed awkwardly. There is no visible pixelation or blurring; the edges are clean and well-defined, suggesting high-resolution rendering. The texture mimics hand-painted artistry, which aligns with the overall illustrative aesthetic of the image. Compared to real-world biological textures, these are not meant to be realistic but artistic, so their consistency lies within the context of stylized representation. Thus, the floral patterns are visually coherent and artistically balanced.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the rider’s Mughal-style attire exhibit natural fabric folds and shading, and are there no visible distortions in garment shape or unrealistic layering?",
    "explanation": "The rider’s clothing in Image B includes a richly embroidered vest (jacket), layered over a long-sleeved shirt, paired with a turban and multiple necklaces. The fabric appears to have subtle folds that follow the contours of the body, particularly noticeable at the sleeves and waistline. The shading is soft and gradual, suggesting depth and volume without harsh contrasts. The layering of garments—such as the vest over the shirt—is anatomically plausible and consistent with historical Mughal fashion. There are no obvious distortions like floating layers or unnatural creases. The embroidery details are intricate but not exaggerated, and the colors blend harmoniously. While some elements may lean toward idealization typical of classical art, the overall depiction remains faithful to both historical accuracy and visual realism within an artistic framework. This suggests careful attention to textile physics and human anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the Mughal-style arches and domes structurally coherent, with smooth curves, correct perspective alignment, and no geometric distortions such as bent columns or skewed outlines?",
    "explanation": "Image B depicts a series of Mughal-style architectural elements including pointed arches, ornate columns, and onion-shaped domes. The arches maintain consistent curvature and symmetry, with proper alignment relative to the central axis of the composition. The columns are straight and evenly spaced, showing no signs of bending or warping. The domes in the background are proportionally scaled and correctly positioned to suggest depth, using linear perspective effectively. The golden hues and decorative patterns on the architecture enhance the sense of grandeur without disrupting structural integrity. There are no visible geometric anomalies such as skewed angles or misaligned joints. The design adheres closely to real-world Mughal architecture principles, particularly seen in buildings like the Taj Mahal or Red Fort, where symmetry and balance are paramount. Therefore, the architectural forms are structurally coherent and visually accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the figures in the crowd display accurate limb proportions, distinct facial features, and consistent clothing details without overlapping bodies or distorted postures?",
    "explanation": "The figures in the background crowd of Image B are depicted in a stylized manner, typical of traditional Indian miniature paintings. While they are smaller and less detailed than the main subjects, they still show recognizable human forms with proportional limbs and distinguishable clothing. Most individuals wear sarees and dhotis appropriate to the cultural setting, with folds and draping that reflect fabric behavior. Facial features are simplified but present—eyes, noses, and mouths are clearly defined. However, due to the artistic style, some figures appear slightly compressed or merged, especially near the edges of the frame, where overlapping occurs. One figure in the lower right seems partially obscured by another, and there is minor ambiguity in posture for a few individuals. These issues are common in illustrative art, where clarity is prioritized over photorealism. Despite slight overlaps, the overall depiction avoids gross distortions or anatomical errors. Given the artistic intent, the level of detail is acceptable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the distribution of ornamental elements (such as garlands, tassels, and patterns) balanced across the image, avoiding overcrowding or asymmetrical placement that disrupts visual harmony?",
    "explanation": "The ornamental elements in Image B—including marigold garlands, tassels hanging from the arches, floral motifs on the elephant, and decorative patterns on pillars—are distributed symmetrically and thoughtfully. The central focus is the elephant adorned with multiple layers of garlands that form a balanced, radial pattern around its head and trunk. The tassels hang evenly from both sides of the archway, contributing to visual symmetry. The floor is scattered with marigold petals, enhancing the festive mood without overwhelming the scene. The gold and red color scheme of the background architecture complements the warm tones of the decorations. There is no area that feels excessively cluttered or barren; each element serves a compositional purpose. The balance between foreground and background ornamentation maintains harmony, reflecting the aesthetic principles of Mughal and Rajput art, where symmetry and rhythm are key. Therefore, the distribution is intentional and harmonious.",
    "answer": "Yes"
