      "question": "Are the spectacles positioned correctly over the bear’s eyes without deforming the surrounding fur or causing unnatural lens reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bear is depicted as an anthropomorphic character wearing spectacles. The glasses are placed symmetrically over the bear's eyes, and the fur around them appears to be naturally parted to accommodate the frames. There is no visible distortion of the fur texture beneath or around the glasses, which suggests a careful integration. Additionally, the lenses reflect light subtly, consistent with glass surfaces under natural lighting, but there are no exaggerated or unrealistic glares that would suggest poor rendering. Based on visual inspection and common sense about realistic object placement in digital art, the spectacles appear to be properly positioned and integrated without compromising anatomical or textural realism.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the bear’s facial expression show subtle aging features (like wrinkles) without distorting the nose, mouth, or jawline geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bear in Image B has a humanized appearance with a white beard and glasses, indicating an elderly character. Around the eyes and forehead, fine lines and wrinkles are present, suggesting age. These details are rendered softly and do not disrupt the underlying structure of the nose, mouth, or jawline. The facial geometry remains consistent with a bear’s anatomy—no unnatural stretching or warping occurs. The wrinkles enhance the character’s wisdom-like persona without violating biological plausibility or artistic coherence. This aligns with common practices in animated characters where aging features are added for expressive depth without structural deformation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the speech bubble clearly connected to the bear’s mouth and does it not obscure or distort nearby fur or water details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B originates from the bear’s mouth area, with a tail pointing directly toward it, ensuring clear attribution. It floats above the bear’s head without overlapping or cutting into the fur texture. The fur below the bubble remains intact and undistorted, and the background elements such as desks and trees are unaffected. Since the bubble is transparent except for its border and text, it does not interfere with the visibility of underlying details like water splashes or forest textures. In digital composition, this kind of overlay is standard practice when maintaining clarity and avoiding visual obstruction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the transformation chart fit naturally within the bear’s mouth without exceeding jaw limits or causing visible deformations in the mouth structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation chart is located on the right panel of Image B and is not inside the bear’s mouth. Instead, it appears superimposed over the river scene, showing the life cycle of a salmon. The bear’s mouth is open only slightly in the left panel, and no chart is inserted into it. Therefore, there is no issue of the chart exceeding jaw limits or deforming the mouth structure because the chart is spatially separate from the bear’s face. This design choice ensures logical consistency—placing educational content outside the bear’s body avoids anatomical impossibilities while still linking it thematically.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the labeled stages in the transformation chart aligned with the river surface and do they cast appropriate shadows or depth cues consistent with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformation chart in the right panel shows the life stages of a salmon—egg, fry, smolt, adult—aligned vertically along the water column. The labels are positioned at depths corresponding to their real-world aquatic environments. For example, 'egg' is near the bottom, and 'adult' is closer to the surface. However, there are no visible shadows cast by the labels or depth cues such as perspective distortion or lighting gradients that would suggest three-dimensional placement. While the alignment is conceptually correct, the lack of shading or environmental interaction makes the labels appear flat and disconnected from the 3D underwater space. Realistic depth cues would include slight blurring, refraction effects, or subtle shadows beneath each label.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the fact box positioned in an open area of the image (e.g., near the riverbank) without covering important details like tree trunks or water flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fact box is located in the lower-right corner of the right panel, adjacent to the riverbank. It is placed over a relatively open section of the scene, avoiding major obstacles such as large tree trunks or prominent rocks. The water flow continues behind it without being obscured, and the text is readable without interference from key environmental elements. Its positioning respects compositional balance and ensures that essential visual information—such as the leaping salmon and surrounding forest—is preserved. This strategic placement follows good graphic design principles for informational overlays.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Is the text in the speech bubble and fact box rendered with clean edges and no pixelation or aliasing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in both the speech bubble and the fact box is sharp and legible, with smooth edges and no visible jagged lines or blurring. The font style is consistent, and anti-aliasing appears to have been applied effectively during rendering. There are no signs of pixelation, especially noticeable in smaller text areas like 'fry' or 'smolt'. High-resolution digital artwork typically uses vector-based or high-DPI rasterization to prevent such artifacts, and this image demonstrates those standards. The clarity indicates professional-grade rendering suitable for display across various devices.",

      "question_id": "Q8",
      "question": "Do the blue hues in the transformation chart and the brown-green tones in the forest background match the original image’s color grading without noticeable shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image B to Image A (the original), the overall color palette of the forest background in Image B retains similar green and brown tones, particularly in the trees and moss-covered rocks. However, the transformation chart introduces a bright cyan-blue hue for the water that contrasts with the more natural, muted teal and dark green tones seen in Image A. This shift creates a stylistic difference rather than a faithful reproduction. While the forest background matches well, the artificial vibrancy of the chart’s water suggests intentional stylization for clarity, potentially deviating from the original’s atmospheric color grading. Thus, while parts match, the entire scene shows a noticeable shift due to the chart’s design.",

      "question": "Are the bear’s fur strands and water splashes still visible and detailed around the added speech bubble and transformation chart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble is placed above the bear in the left panel and does not overlap with any part of the bear’s fur or water splashes. Similarly, the transformation chart is on the right panel and does not intersect with the bear at all. As a result, the fur strands and water details remain fully visible and unobstructed. Both overlays are carefully positioned to avoid masking critical visual elements. In digital compositing, transparency and layering techniques are used to preserve underlying details, and this image demonstrates effective use of such methods.",

      "question": "Do both panels occupy their intended regions within the 16:9 frame without cutting off the bear’s legs or the tree line at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is split into two vertical panels. The left panel shows the bear standing in a classroom setting, and the right panel displays the salmon lifecycle in a forest river. Both panels are evenly distributed across the 16:9 frame. The bear’s full body, including legs, is visible without truncation. On the right side, the tree line extends to the edge of the frame, but no important elements are cut off; instead, the composition maintains continuity. The layout respects aspect ratio constraints and ensures all key components are contained within the boundaries, making it a balanced and complete presentation.",
