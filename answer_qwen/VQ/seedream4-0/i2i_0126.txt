    "Question": "Q1: Are the proportions of both characters consistent and free from distortion in their respective views within the combined illustration?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two main characters — a woman on the left and a man on the right — are depicted in a side profile view. Their body proportions appear consistent with typical human anatomy: head size relative to torso, limb length, and posture are proportionate and symmetrical. The figures are drawn in a flat vector style, which inherently simplifies details but maintains balanced proportions. There is no visible stretching, compression, or unnatural scaling of limbs or facial features. Additionally, both characters are shown in similar poses and attire, suggesting intentional consistency in design. When comparing this to Image A (the original), the same character proportions are preserved, indicating that the editing process did not introduce distortions. The repetition of the scene in multiple panels (including a top-down view) further reinforces that the characters' proportions remain consistent across different perspectives, supporting the conclusion that they are free from distortion.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the textures of the office elements such as chairs, plants, and desks appear natural and retain fine details without obvious artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The office elements in Image B — including the dark blue office chairs, potted plants, and black desks — are rendered in a clean, flat vector art style. While the style is stylized rather than photorealistic, it does not contain visible artifacts such as pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistent shading. The chairs have smooth surfaces with simple highlights indicating form, and the plant leaves show uniform shapes and color gradients appropriate for the artistic medium. The desk surfaces are solid-colored with minimal detail, which is typical for this type of illustration. Comparing to Image A, the same elements are present with identical rendering styles, confirming that no new texture artifacts were introduced during editing. Since the goal of this art style is clarity and simplicity rather than photorealism, the absence of visual flaws like noise or misaligned patterns supports the assessment that textures appear natural within the context of the artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the computer screens realistic with sharp images, and does the interaction between the characters and screens appear natural without visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The computer monitors in Image B display clear, sharp images of two individuals engaged in video calls. The screen content is well-defined, with no blurring or pixelation, and the faces on the screens are proportionally consistent with the rest of the illustration. Each character interacts with their keyboard and mouse in a natural posture, suggesting active engagement with the devices. The alignment of hands on keyboards and eyes directed toward screens indicates plausible user behavior. There are no visible glitches, transparency errors, or overlapping issues that would suggest digital artifacts. In comparison to Image A, the screen content and interactions remain unchanged and coherent. The repeated layout across multiple panels in Image B (especially the mirrored scenes) shows consistent rendering of screen displays and character actions, reinforcing the realism within the illustrative style. Given the flat design approach, the screens are not meant to simulate real-world reflections or depth, but they are functionally and visually accurate for the context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the characters align correctly with their environment, maintaining a plausible spatial relationship and avoiding any broken geometric shapes or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both characters are seated at desks with proper alignment to their chairs and surrounding objects. The legs and feet of each character are positioned under the table in a way that reflects realistic sitting posture. The chairs are placed directly beneath them, and the arms reach naturally toward the keyboards. The tables are horizontally aligned and support the monitors and peripherals without floating or misplacement. Notably, there is a top-down inset view showing the arrangement from above, which confirms that the seating positions and object placements are geometrically sound and consistent with the side views. This multi-perspective representation helps verify spatial accuracy. Compared to Image A, the layout remains consistent, and no new misalignments or broken shapes have been introduced. The use of symmetry and repeated elements enhances the sense of structural integrity, ensuring that all components fit together logically within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the lighting, including the hanging lamp’s shadow and the light on the characters, maintain consistency and contribute to the natural appearance of the scene without unnatural contrasts?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is represented by a single pendant lamp casting a conical beam of light onto the right side of the room. The illuminated area is clearly defined, creating a soft gradient of brightness that falls off gradually. This light source affects the characters on the right side more strongly, particularly the man, whose face and clothing appear slightly brighter, consistent with being under direct illumination. On the left, the lighting is more ambient, likely due to reflected light or background illumination, which creates a balanced contrast without harsh shadows. The shadow cast by the lamp is consistent in shape and direction, suggesting a logical light source position. However, the overall lighting lacks dynamic depth or subtle gradients that might be expected in a real environment; instead, it follows a simplified model suitable for flat illustrations. Despite this stylization, there are no abrupt transitions or unnatural contrasts that would disrupt the scene's coherence. Compared to Image A, the lighting setup is identical, confirming that no inconsistencies were introduced during editing. Therefore, while not photorealistic, the lighting is internally consistent and contributes appropriately to the scene’s atmosphere.",
    "answer": "Yes"
