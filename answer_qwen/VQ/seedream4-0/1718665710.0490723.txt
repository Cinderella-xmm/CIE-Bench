    "Question": "Q1: Is the head proportionally enlarged without distorting facial features or flattening the curls of the hair?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi-style design, which typically involves an exaggerated head-to-body ratio. The head is significantly larger than the body, a common stylistic choice in chibi art to emphasize cuteness and expressiveness. However, despite the enlargement, the facial features—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—are clearly defined and proportionally balanced within the face. The curls of the hair are preserved with distinct, rounded shapes and shading that suggest volume and depth, indicating that the curls have not been flattened. This suggests that while the head is enlarged, it maintains stylistic integrity without distorting key features or losing detail in the hair.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the black outlines uniformly thick and cleanly separated from internal details such as hair, skin, and armor engravings?",
    "explanation": "The black outlines in Image B are consistent in thickness across the entire figure, defining the edges of the character's form. These outlines are sharply delineated and separate cleanly from internal elements like the hair strands, skin tone, and engraved patterns on the armor. There are no visible bleed-throughs or overlapping artifacts between the outline and the inner details. This clean separation is typical of high-quality digital illustrations or enamel pins, where precise vector-based rendering ensures crisp boundaries. The contrast between the black lines and the colored areas enhances clarity and definition, suggesting careful design and execution.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the armor display consistent glossy reflections and smooth color transitions without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
    "explanation": "The armor in Image B exhibits a polished, metallic appearance with subtle highlights and reflections that simulate light interaction with a glossy surface. These reflections are consistent across different parts of the armor, such as the chest plate and shoulder guards, and follow logical lighting directions. The color transitions are smooth, with gradients that suggest curvature and dimensionality. There is no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or repeating textures that would indicate low resolution or texture tiling. The use of shading and specular highlights contributes to a realistic yet stylized finish, indicative of high-quality digital rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the shoulder pauldrons and chest plate clearly defined with intact edges and symmetrical design, free from geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "The shoulder pauldrons and chest plate in Image B are well-defined with sharp, clean edges. The symmetry between the left and right sides of the armor is evident, with matching shapes, sizes, and decorative elements. The design includes angular and curved components that maintain structural coherence. There are no visible warping, stretching, or misalignments that would suggest geometric distortion. The overall construction appears intentional and balanced, consistent with the aesthetic of stylized fantasy armor in collectible merchandise.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the silver chain attached at a coherent point and composed of uniformly shaped links that appear physically connected to the figure?",
    "explanation": "The silver chain in Image B is attached at the top of the character’s head via a small ring, which connects to the uppermost part of the figure. The chain consists of uniformly shaped oval links that are evenly spaced and aligned, creating a realistic representation of a metal chain. The connection point appears secure and anatomically plausible for a pendant or keychain. Each link is clearly rendered with consistent size and shape, and there is no visual break in continuity, suggesting a physically plausible attachment. This design aligns with standard practices in jewelry or collectible accessory manufacturing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the background exhibit a uniform dark texture with no bright reflections or unnatural gradients, consistent with velvet material?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is dark and textured, resembling a soft fabric such as velvet. It has a matte finish with subtle variations in tone that mimic the natural pile of velvet, including slight shadows and highlights that suggest depth and texture. There are no bright reflections or abrupt color shifts that would indicate artificial lighting or digital artifacts. The gradient is smooth and consistent, enhancing the perception of a real-world material. This type of background is commonly used in product photography to highlight objects without distraction, and the texture matches known characteristics of velvet.",
    "answer": "Yes"
