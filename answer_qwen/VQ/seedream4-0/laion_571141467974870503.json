      "question": "Are the bold primary colors applied to the train's body consistent across all surfaces without visible color bleeding or mismatched tones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train's body is rendered in a stylized pop-art aesthetic with bold primary colors such as red, yellow, blue, and purple. These colors are applied in distinct blocks across different panels of the train. Upon close inspection, the transitions between colors are sharp and well-defined, with no visible blending or gradient effects that would suggest color bleeding. The application appears intentional and uniform, adhering to the graphic style typical of halftone or comic-book art. Each surface—such as the front, sides, and top—has clearly delineated color zones, and there is no evidence of mismatched tones within a single panel. This consistency aligns with the artistic intent of pop art, where clean separation of hues is essential. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of graphic design principles, the colors are consistently applied.",

      "question": "Do the halftone dot patterns on the train display consistent size, spacing, and alignment across all visible panels without distortion or clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The halftone dot pattern is a defining feature of the pop-art style seen in Image B. On the train, particularly noticeable on the front windshield, side panels, and parts of the roof, these dots are used to create shading and texture. Observing the pattern across different areas, the dots appear uniformly spaced and consistently sized, forming regular grids. There is no visible distortion, clustering, or irregularity that would disrupt the visual harmony of the design. The alignment remains coherent even at curved surfaces like the front of the train, suggesting digital precision in rendering. In pop art, such consistency is crucial for maintaining the stylistic integrity. Given that the dots maintain their structure across all visible panels, the answer is affirmative.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes used to replace the barn’s wood texture aligned with the original architectural elements such as windows, doors, and roofline without breaking their structural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the barn's wooden texture has been replaced with abstract geometric shapes—primarily rectangles and triangles—in contrasting colors like red, white, and black. These shapes are arranged in a way that follows the general layout of the building, respecting the positions of windows and doors. For instance, the windows remain intact in shape and placement, with the geometric pattern wrapping around them rather than intruding into their frames. Similarly, the door and roofline retain their original outlines, and the geometric fills do not cross over these boundaries. This suggests that the transformation was carefully designed to preserve the structural integrity of the architecture while applying a stylized overlay. Thus, the geometric shapes are aligned with the original architectural elements without violating their spatial constraints.",

      "question": "Are the graphic bursts representing foliage positioned in a way that respects the original spatial layout, with no overlapping or misplaced elements that contradict the scene’s depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foliage in Image B includes stylized graphic bursts—particularly the large red burst on the left side of the image—which resemble exaggerated plant forms or explosions of color. These bursts are placed in the foreground, near the track and adjacent to the trees. While they are artistically expressive, they do not overlap with the train or barn in a way that breaks the perceived depth of the scene. Instead, they are positioned to appear as part of the landscape, extending outward from the natural vegetation. Their placement respects the relative distance between objects: the train is on the track, the barn is further back, and the bursts are in the foreground. Although the style is abstract, the composition maintains spatial coherence. There is no evidence of misplaced elements that would suggest a contradiction in depth perception. Therefore, the graphic bursts are appropriately integrated into the scene’s layout.",

      "question": "Are the black outlines around the train, barn, and foliage uniformly sharp, continuous, and free from gaps or misalignments at object edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the entire scene is outlined with bold black lines, characteristic of comic book or pop-art illustrations. These outlines define the edges of the train, barn, trees, and other elements. Upon close examination, the lines are consistently sharp and continuous, with no visible gaps, breaks, or misalignments. Even at complex junctions—such as where the train meets the tracks or where the roofline intersects with walls—the outlines remain precise and uninterrupted. This level of uniformity is typical of digitally vectorized or professionally rendered graphic art, where edge clarity is critical for visual impact. The absence of artifacts or inconsistencies confirms that the outlines are well-executed and maintain their integrity across all objects. Therefore, the black outlines meet the criteria of being uniformly sharp and continuous.",
