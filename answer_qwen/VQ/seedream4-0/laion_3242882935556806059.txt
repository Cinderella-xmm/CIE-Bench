    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the petals are depicted with jagged crystal facets that follow the general curvature of lily petals. The facets create a crystalline appearance while maintaining the overall shape and flow of the petals. There is no visible warping or geometric breaks disrupting the natural form of the petals. This conclusion is drawn by observing the continuity of the petal shapes and their alignment with typical lily petal structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The glass rods in Image B extend naturally from the vase upward, appearing to match the number and spacing expected from stems supporting a bouquet. They do not seem disconnected or misaligned; instead, they maintain a consistent arrangement that suggests they are part of the same structure as the flowers above. Comparing this with Image A, where the stems support the original lilies, the glass rods in Image B mimic this natural extension effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The black marble surface beneath the vase in Image B appears smooth, uniformly dark, and reflective. Shadows and highlights on the surface are consistent with the light source and object placement, suggesting a realistic interaction between light and the material. The reflections and subtle variations in shading indicate a polished, reflective surface typical of black marble.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The crystal petals in Image B exhibit subtle variations in amber hue and transparency. The internal light refractions and depth cues suggest volume and translucency, creating an impression of three-dimensional structure. These characteristics are consistent with how light interacts with translucent materials like crystals, enhancing the perception of depth and texture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The glass rods entering the water in Image B show slight bending at the waterline, which is consistent with the optical effect of refraction. The rods remain submerged without floating or disappearing mid-length, indicating a realistic depiction of how objects interact with water. This aligns with physical principles governing the behavior of light and objects in liquid environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"
