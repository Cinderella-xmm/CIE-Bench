      "question": "Does the LEGO version of the military ship maintain its original shape and structural proportions without visible distortions or misaligned brick patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model in Image B depicts a warship with a distinct hull, superstructure, and deck features such as gun turrets and radar arrays. The overall shape closely resembles real-world naval vessels, particularly aircraft carriers or battleships, with a long, flat deck and elevated command tower. The brickwork appears consistent, with no obvious gaps or misalignments in the pattern. The structure maintains symmetry and proportional scaling across the length of the ship, suggesting careful construction. While LEGO models inherently have blocky geometry due to the nature of the bricks, the model preserves key design elements like the angled bow, deck layout, and vertical structures. There are no visible distortions or irregularities in the brick placement that would suggest poor assembly or design flaws. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of LEGO engineering principles, the model adheres well to the intended form.",

      "question": "Are the LEGO-rendered ocean waves shaped in a way that mimics natural wave motion, without appearing overly rigid or uniformly flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ocean surface in Image B is constructed using blue LEGO baseplates with white pieces arranged to simulate waves. These white elements are placed along the edges of the ship, forming crest-like shapes that resemble breaking waves. However, the wave forms are highly stylized and repetitive, lacking the organic variation seen in real water dynamics. The waves follow a uniform pattern and lack curvature or randomness that would mimic natural wave motion. Additionally, the spacing between wave crests is consistent, which contributes to a rigid, artificial appearance. While the intent to represent waves is clear, the execution does not capture the fluidity and complexity of real ocean waves. Therefore, despite being creative, the representation is not realistic in terms of natural motion.",

      "question": "Are the LEGO accessories used for the boat deck properly scaled and positioned to match the size and perspective of the character and the surrounding scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO minifigure stands on the deck of the ship, wearing a brown vest over a white shirt, which is typical of LEGO character design. The figure’s height is proportionate to the scale of the ship, which is built from standard LEGO bricks. The deck includes small details like a red box and black components resembling equipment or sensors, all of which are appropriately sized relative to the minifigure. The positioning of these accessories appears intentional and consistent with the spatial logic of a ship's deck—equipment is near the centerline, and the figure stands upright as if operating or observing. Given that LEGO sets are designed with precise scaling, the accessories and their placement align with expected proportions and perspective within the model’s context. There is no evidence of mismatched scale or awkward placement.",

      "question": "Do the LEGO-textured life vest and shirt retain their original colors and show no signs of unnatural texture repetition, pixelation, or mismatched edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The minifigure’s clothing consists of a white shirt and a brown life vest made from printed LEGO elements. The colors are solid and consistent with standard LEGO color palettes. The vest has a grid-like pattern of orange-brown squares, which is typical of LEGO print designs and does not appear pixelated or distorted. The edges of the vest and shirt align cleanly with the minifigure’s torso, showing no visible gaps or misalignment. LEGO prints are usually applied at high resolution and are designed to avoid repetition artifacts. In this case, the textures are sharp and uniform, with no evidence of distortion or unnatural seams. The lighting in the image enhances clarity, further confirming the absence of visual defects.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO model positioned on a shelf that appears structurally sound and spatially coherent, with appropriate shadows and depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO model is displayed on a white shelf, which appears clean and stable. The shelf has defined edges and supports the model without any sagging or deformation. Shadows are cast beneath the model and the shelf, indicating directional lighting from above, which adds depth and realism to the scene. The background includes another larger LEGO ship, slightly out of focus, creating a sense of depth and layered space. The alignment of the model on the shelf is centered and balanced, with no tilting or uneven placement. The overall composition suggests careful arrangement, with proper lighting and spatial coherence. This setup reflects a realistic display environment, reinforcing the impression of a well-constructed and thoughtfully presented diorama.",

      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, misaligned bricks, or missing pieces in the LEGO model that break the illusion of a cohesive construction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the LEGO model, the bricks appear tightly assembled with no visible gaps or misaligned pieces. The edges of the ship are smooth and continuous, with consistent brick patterns along the hull and superstructure. There are no jagged lines or exposed studs that would indicate incomplete assembly. The details such as the radar mast, gun placements, and deck fixtures are integrated seamlessly into the overall structure. The lighting highlights the texture of the bricks but does not reveal any inconsistencies or errors in construction. The model appears fully completed and professionally assembled, maintaining the illusion of a cohesive and intact LEGO creation. No artifacts such as floating pieces or broken connections are present.",
