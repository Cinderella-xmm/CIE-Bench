      "question": "Are the geometric shapes applied to the suit clearly defined, aligned with the contours of the body, and free from jagged or broken edges that disrupt the figure’s natural posture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the suit is rendered in a highly stylized, low-poly geometric fashion. The shapes are sharply defined, composed of angular facets that follow the general silhouette of the torso, arms, and shoulders. These polygons are carefully arranged to mimic the natural curves of the human form, particularly around the chest, elbows, and waist. Despite the abstraction, the edges of the polygons align well with the underlying anatomy—such as the shoulder line and arm bend—without introducing jaggedness or breaks that would distort the posture. The transitions between facets are smooth in terms of visual continuity, even though they are angular. This suggests an intentional design choice that maintains structural coherence while embracing stylization. Based on this analysis, the geometric forms do not disrupt the figure's natural seated posture.",

      "question": "Does the chair retain a stable, grounded structure with symmetrical, flowing patterns that align with the figure’s seated position and do not appear to float or tilt unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B is depicted with a futuristic, geometric design featuring vertical slats and a metallic sheen. It appears firmly planted on the ground, with visible legs extending downward and supporting the seat. The symmetry of the chair is preserved along its central axis, and the slats follow a consistent, repeating pattern that complements the angular style of the suit. The figure’s right arm rests naturally on the backrest, which is positioned at a height appropriate for someone seated. There is no visual indication of floating or tilting; the chair remains level and balanced relative to the figure’s posture. Furthermore, the perspective lines converge appropriately, reinforcing the sense of stability. Therefore, despite its abstract design, the chair maintains a grounded and structurally sound appearance.",

      "question": "Is the sunset gradient in the background smooth and continuous, with no abrupt color shifts or haloing along the edges of the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a vibrant sunset gradient transitioning from deep purple at the top through reds and oranges to a warm yellow near the horizon. The color blending is smooth and gradual, with no visible banding or harsh transitions between hues. Along the edges of the figure, especially around the outline of the head, shoulders, and arms, there is no evidence of haloing (a bright or dark glow caused by poor edge masking). Instead, the figure’s silhouette cleanly separates from the background, suggesting precise compositing. The lighting on the figure also integrates well with the ambient light of the sunset, enhancing realism without introducing artifacts. Thus, the gradient is both aesthetically pleasing and technically clean.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the metallic silver and blue areas of the suit show coherent highlights and reflections that follow a single light source and avoid repeating textures or unnatural glossiness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B exhibits a reflective, metallic finish with silver and blue tones. Highlights are consistently placed on the upper surfaces of the geometric facets, particularly on the shoulders, lapels, and outer arms, indicating a light source coming from the upper left. These highlights follow logical reflection patterns based on the angles of the polygons, creating a sense of depth and volume. There is no repetition of texture across the surface—each facet has unique shading based on its orientation. The glossiness appears uniform and plausible for a polished metal material, without over-saturation or artificial shine. While stylized, the rendering adheres to principles of realistic light interaction, avoiding visual inconsistencies such as conflicting reflections or flat areas that lack variation. Therefore, the reflections are coherent and believable within the artistic context.",

      "question": "Does the hand on the chair have five distinct fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and are the joints and knuckles proportionally accurate and not distorted by stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand resting on the chair in Image B is rendered in a semi-realistic style, with clear delineation of five fingers. Each finger is distinguishable, with appropriate spacing and curvature that mimics natural hand anatomy. The knuckles and joints are visible and proportionate, showing subtle articulation that corresponds to a relaxed grip. Although the overall image uses geometric abstraction, the hand itself avoids excessive stylization—its proportions remain anatomically plausible. The thumb is correctly positioned and angled, and the palm connects naturally to the forearm. There is no distortion such as elongated fingers or flattened joints. This careful attention to detail ensures that the hand remains recognizable and physically credible within the stylized context.",
