    "Question": "Q1: Are the leadwork outlines along the spiral vortex continuous, following the curve without gaps, overlaps, or abrupt breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the spiral vortex is depicted with a stained glass effect, where the leadwork outlines are clearly visible. These outlines follow the curves of the spiral closely and appear to be continuous. There are no noticeable gaps or abrupt breaks in these lines, which suggests that they have been carefully designed to maintain the integrity of the spiral shape. The absence of overlaps further supports the continuity of the lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the jewel-toned colors applied to the sky and tree canopies transition smoothly without visible color banding or unnatural patches?",
    "explanation": "The jewel-toned colors in Image B are applied in a way that mimics stained glass, with each piece of 'glass' having a distinct color. While there are clear divisions between different colored pieces, the transitions between adjacent colors do not show harsh banding or unnatural patches. Instead, the colors blend well within the context of the stained glass style, creating a harmonious appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Are the faceted glass textures applied uniformly across the spiral and trees, showing clear refraction effects without blurring or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The faceted glass texture in Image B is consistent throughout the spiral and trees, maintaining a uniform appearance. Each facet reflects light, giving the impression of refraction. There is no significant blurring or loss of detail; instead, the facets enhance the visual complexity and depth of the image, contributing to a detailed and vibrant representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Do the leadwork lines form clean, unbroken borders around the spiral, trees, and horizon without intersecting incorrectly or creating floating segments?",
    "explanation": "The leadwork lines in Image B serve as borders for the various elements such as the spiral, trees, and horizon. These lines are clean and unbroken, effectively separating different sections of the image. There are no intersections that appear incorrect or segments that seem to float independently, indicating a well-executed design that respects the boundaries of each element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the individual stars within the spiral and the reflections on the water surface still distinguishable and not obscured by the glass texture or color saturation?",
    "explanation": "Despite the application of the stained glass effect, the individual stars within the spiral and their reflections on the water surface remain distinguishable in Image B. The glass texture and color saturation do not obscure these details excessively; rather, they integrate seamlessly into the overall artistic style, allowing viewers to still perceive the stars and their reflections clearly.",
    "answer": "Yes"
