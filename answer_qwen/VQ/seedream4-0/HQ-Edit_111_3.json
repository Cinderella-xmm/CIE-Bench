      "question": "Are the monochrome line-drawings for the antennae, wings, abdomen, and thorax accurately aligned with the actual anatomy of the butterfly and do they follow its natural contours without overlapping incorrectly or creating geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the monochrome line-drawing of the butterfly is superimposed over the original colored butterfly. The outline of the wings, thorax, abdomen, and antennae appears to closely follow the shape and proportions of a typical butterfly anatomy, such as the Morpho species shown in Image A. The wing venation pattern is consistent with real butterfly wing structure—featuring a central vein branching into secondary veins, which aligns with biological accuracy. The antennae are correctly depicted as clubbed at the ends, a hallmark of butterflies (as opposed to moths). The thorax and abdomen segments are proportionally accurate, with no apparent overlap or distortion. While the drawing is schematic, it maintains anatomical fidelity to the underlying form. Comparing with Image A, the line art matches the butterfly’s silhouette and internal segmentation precisely, indicating careful alignment. There are no geometric distortions or misalignments; thus, the drawing respects natural contours.",

      "question": "Do the added pink petals appear seamlessly integrated into the surrounding flora with consistent lighting, texture, and shadow alignment, avoiding any visible seams or artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, there are no new pink petals added beyond those already present in the background flora. The existing pink flowers, including the prominent one beneath the butterfly, are part of the original scene and not digitally inserted. Their integration with the surrounding greenery is natural, with soft shadows, realistic petal curvature, and consistent lighting that matches the ambient sunlight in the image. The textures of the petals show subtle gradients and surface details that suggest authenticity. Since no additional petals were introduced, there are no artificial edges or seam issues to evaluate. Therefore, while the question implies an edit involving new petals, no such addition exists. The original floral elements are well-integrated, but the premise of 'added' petals is incorrect.",

      "question": "Are the text boxes positioned in non-obtrusive areas of the image, clearly readable, and visually balanced so they do not interfere with the butterfly or floral elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text boxes in Image B are placed around the perimeter of the butterfly and flower, primarily in the corners and along the edges of the image. While some labels point directly to anatomical features (e.g., wings, thorax), their placement avoids covering critical parts of the butterfly’s body or the main flower. However, several text boxes are partially overlaid on the petals and leaves, especially in the lower-left and lower-right quadrants, which can obscure parts of the floral elements. Additionally, the text within the boxes is largely illegible due to gibberish content (e.g., 'Acetel Bodothy neoithiny'), suggesting either a placeholder or error in rendering. Despite this, the layout attempts visual balance by distributing annotations evenly. Nevertheless, the readability issue and partial obstruction of natural elements reduce the overall effectiveness. Thus, while the positioning is generally non-intrusive, the lack of legibility and minor obstructions affect clarity.",

      "question": "Is the vibrant blue color of the butterfly’s wings preserved uniformly across all areas, including under and around the overlaid anatomical lines, without any visible discoloration or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings are now represented by a monochrome line drawing, which replaces the original vibrant blue coloration seen in Image A. The blue color is completely absent beneath the line art, as the drawing overlays the entire butterfly, effectively removing the original hue. This means the blue color is not preserved—it has been replaced entirely. The line drawing itself does not exhibit discoloration, but since the original color is gone, the condition of 'preservation' fails. Comparing to Image A, where the blue is vivid and uniform across the wings, Image B shows a stark contrast: the color is lost in favor of a black-and-white sketch. Therefore, the preservation of the blue color cannot be said to have occurred.",

      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or unnatural textures in the areas where edits were made (e.g., line drawings, text boxes, added petals)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The line drawing of the butterfly in Image B appears smooth and clean, with no visible jagged edges or pixelation, indicating high-resolution rendering. The lines are crisp and consistent, suggesting professional digital vector work rather than low-quality raster editing. The text boxes also display clear borders and legible fonts (despite nonsensical text), with no pixelation or blurring. However, the text content itself is corrupted, likely due to encoding errors or AI-generated noise, which could be considered an artifact of content generation. The floral elements remain unchanged from Image A and show no signs of unnatural texture or seams. There are no added petals, so no related artifacts exist. Overall, the technical quality of the edits (line art and text) is high, but the corrupted text content introduces a type of digital artifact. Given that the question refers to visual artifacts like jagged lines or pixelation, and these are not present, the answer leans toward 'No'. However, if textual corruption counts as an artifact, it might qualify. But strictly speaking, visual artifacts are absent.",
