    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the object on the table is not a piano but a gingerbread cookie designed to resemble one. The surface of this cookie exhibits a uniform caramel color typical of baked gingerbread. It has visible white and gold icing details that are common in edible decorations for cookies. These details include patterns resembling keys and other ornamental designs. There are no unnatural textures or digital artifacts present; the appearance is consistent with a crafted food item.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The object in Image B is a gingerbread cookie shaped like a piano. Its components such as the lid, body, and legs are stylized representations rather than realistic parts. They are aligned in a way that mimics a piano's structure but are clearly part of a single, flat cookie. There is no deformation or geometric distortion since it is intentionally designed as a decorative cookie.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The color transition from black to caramel is not applicable here because the object is entirely caramel-colored as a gingerbread cookie. There are no soft gradients or natural light interactions matching the room's lighting, as the cookie's color is uniform and its design is purely decorative.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The 'keys' on the gingerbread cookie in Image B appear as distinct, uniformly shaped sugar crystals arranged in a regular pattern along the keyboard area of the cookie. They are well-defined and follow a logical sequence, without any missing or misaligned elements, which is typical for carefully decorated edible items.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The white marble tabletop beneath the gingerbread cookie in Image B appears flat and properly scaled. It displays natural stone patterns and shadows that align with the light source above, suggesting a realistic setup where the cookie is placed on a real marble surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "All edges of the gingerbread cookie and its decorative elements in Image B are sharp and clean. There is no visible pixelation, smudging, or unnatural blending at boundaries, indicating high-quality craftsmanship and photography of the cookie.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:",
    "explanation": "The shadows cast by the gingerbread cookie onto the marble table in Image B match the light direction from the chandelier above. They appear soft and naturally diffused, consistent with how light would interact with a three-dimensional object placed under a chandelier in a similar setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
