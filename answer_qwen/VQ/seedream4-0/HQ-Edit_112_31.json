      "question": "Is the horseâ€™s head enlarged proportionally so that facial features like the eyes and muzzle remain clearly defined and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image in question does not depict a horse but rather a plush lion. Therefore, there is no horse head to analyze for proportional enlargement or distortion of facial features. The analysis must be based on the visual cues present in the image, which clearly show a plush toy with distinct characteristics of a lion.",
