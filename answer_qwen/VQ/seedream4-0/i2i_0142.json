      "question": "Do the textures and materials of the baseball and glove appear natural and consistent in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the baseball and glove are shown in three different views: top, side, and sectional. The textures of the leather glove and the stitching on the baseball appear consistent with real-world materials. The leather has a natural grain pattern, and the baseball's stitching is detailed and realistic. There is no indication of unnatural or inconsistent textures across these views. The analysis is based on visual cues such as texture details and material appearance, combined with common knowledge about sports equipment.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the baseball and glove accurate and maintain their expected size relationships in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the baseball and glove seem accurate in all three views. In the top view, the baseball fits naturally within the glove's pocket. The side view shows the glove's depth and curvature realistically, and the sectional view maintains the expected size relationship between the ball and glove. Comparing this to Image A, where the same objects are shown in a similar context, the proportions remain consistent. The reasoning involves assessing the relative sizes and shapes based on typical dimensions of baseball and gloves.",

      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or unnatural blending, around the baseball or glove in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the three views in Image B, there are no visible artifacts like jagged edges or unnatural blending around the baseball or glove. The edges of both objects are smooth, and the transitions between the objects and their backgrounds are seamless. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clarity and continuity of the object boundaries in each view.",

      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove look natural and consistent with the lighting conditions in all three views?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and highlights on the baseball and glove in Image B appear natural and consistent with the lighting conditions. The top view shows soft shadows that suggest a diffused light source, while the side and sectional views also display realistic shading that enhances the three-dimensional appearance of the objects. Comparing with Image A, the lighting seems similarly applied, maintaining consistency in how light interacts with the surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition and layout in each of the three views (top, side, sectional) logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition and layout in each of the three views logically represent the baseball and glove in a visually credible manner. The top view provides a clear perspective of the ball resting in the glove, the side view offers a sense of depth and dimension, and the sectional view gives insight into the internal structure of the glove. Each view contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the objects, which aligns with common practices in product photography and design.",
