      "question": "Does the translucent green LEGO brick construction of the bottle’s body maintain a consistent cylindrical form without visible warping or misalignment between bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bottle in Image B is constructed using translucent green bricks arranged to mimic the shape of the original Bacardi Mojito bottle. Observing the body, the bricks appear to be carefully aligned in vertical and horizontal rows, forming a smooth, continuous curve that closely follows the contour of a standard bottle. There are no visible gaps, overlaps, or angular distortions that would suggest warping or misalignment. The use of different shades of green bricks adds depth and realism while maintaining structural consistency. Given the precision typically seen in LEGO constructions and the uniformity of the brick placement, it is reasonable to conclude that the cylindrical form is well-maintained. This conclusion is supported by common knowledge of LEGO building techniques, where such models prioritize symmetry and alignment for aesthetic and structural integrity.",

      "question": "Are all brand text elements (e.g., \"BACARDÍ\", \"MOJITO\") and logos clearly identifiable and properly aligned on the LEGO label, without distorted letterforms or missing characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO label on the bottle features printed elements designed to replicate the original Bacardi Mojito branding. The text 'BACARDÍ' and 'MOJITO' are constructed using individual LEGO tiles with printed letters. These letters are legible and proportionally spaced, with the font style closely matching the original design. The bat logo above the brand name is also accurately represented, with clear red and black colors and correct proportions. While slight pixelation or minor inconsistencies might occur due to the blocky nature of LEGO printing, there is no visible distortion, missing characters, or misalignment. The overall layout mirrors the original label’s structure, including the placement of the tagline 'Classic Cocktails' and the signature below. Based on the visual clarity and alignment observed, the branding elements are faithfully reproduced within the constraints of LEGO medium-scale modeling.",

      "question": "Is the blue LEGO cap accurately shaped as a cylinder with consistent height and diameter matching the original bottle’s neck, and does it feature a smooth, rounded top without angular breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cap of the LEGO bottle is made from blue LEGO pieces stacked vertically to form a cylindrical shape. It appears to have a consistent diameter along its length, matching the narrow neck of the bottle. However, upon close inspection, the top of the cap is composed of stud-covered LEGO bricks, which inherently create a slightly stepped or faceted surface rather than a perfectly smooth, rounded dome. While this is a common limitation in LEGO designs—where rounded forms are approximated using flat studs—the cap still maintains a generally cylindrical shape. The height seems appropriate relative to the neck, but the top lacks a truly smooth curvature; instead, it has a geometric, angular finish due to the brick construction. Therefore, although the cap is functional and visually plausible, it does not achieve a perfectly smooth, rounded top as seen in real-world bottle caps.",

      "question": "Is the white shelf beneath the LEGO bottle flat, horizontally aligned, and free from irregular edges or floating segments that suggest poor integration with the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white shelf in Image B is depicted as a clean, rectangular surface supporting the LEGO bottle. It appears flat and level, with sharp, straight edges and no visible warping or unevenness. The shelf is positioned horizontally and extends outward from a wall-mounted bracket, which is partially visible on the right side. The lighting and shadows indicate a solid, grounded placement with no floating or disconnected parts. There are no signs of digital artifacts, jagged lines, or inconsistent textures that would suggest poor rendering or integration into the scene. In fact, the shelf looks like a typical minimalist display shelf, commonly used in product photography. Thus, based on visual cues and common expectations of physical object representation, the shelf is well-integrated and structurally sound.",

      "question": "Are the smaller text elements such as \"natural mint flavor\" and \"Simply pour over ice\" fully visible and correctly spaced on the LEGO label, without overlapping or broken lettering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lower portion of the LEGO label includes smaller text elements such as 'natural mint flavor', 'lime juice', 'cane sugar', and 'Simply pour over ice'. These texts are rendered using small printed LEGO tiles. Upon examination, the words are legible and placed in a readable format. However, due to the limited resolution and scale of LEGO printing, some letters may appear slightly blurred or compressed. More importantly, the phrase 'Simply pour over ice' is present but shows a minor issue: the word 'over' appears to be partially obscured or misaligned, possibly due to spacing constraints or print errors in the LEGO tile. Additionally, the text 'natural mint flavor' is visible but uses a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters that may not align perfectly with the original design. While most elements are readable, the slight misalignment and potential truncation of certain words suggest that not all smaller text is fully accurate or cleanly presented. Therefore, despite being mostly visible, the spacing and clarity of these elements fall short of perfect reproduction.",
