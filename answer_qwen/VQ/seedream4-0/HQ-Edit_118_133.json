      "question": "Does the surface of the teapotâ€™s body exhibit a consistent, smooth high-gloss ceramic finish without visible texture artifacts or abrupt transitions from the original metallic look?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot's body appears to have a smooth, high-gloss ceramic finish. The surface lacks visible texture artifacts and maintains a consistent appearance throughout. There are no abrupt transitions or inconsistencies that would suggest remnants of the original metallic look. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniform sheen and lack of irregularities on the surface.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wick in Image B is positioned at the tip of what was formerly the spout location. It is oriented straight and vertically, aligning naturally with the candle design. There is no visible bending or deformation, which suggests careful placement and consideration for the overall aesthetic of the candle within the teapot.",

      "question": "Is the handle now rendered as a solid gold-colored accent with no visible remnants of the original wood or metal, and does it retain its original curvature without warping or unnatural thickness changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handle in Image B is rendered as a solid gold-colored accent. It does not show any visible remnants of the original wood or metal material. The curvature of the handle remains consistent with its original form, without warping or unnatural thickness changes. This analysis is based on the visual coherence and uniformity of the handle's appearance.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns around the base of the teapot in Image B are evenly spaced and proportionally scaled. They appear stylistically consistent with the engraved motifs on the rest of the teapot, without overlapping or distorting the base structure. This assessment is made by examining the regularity and harmony of the patterns in relation to the teapot's design.",
