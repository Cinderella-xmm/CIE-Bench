      "question": "Are the golden embroidery patterns on the central figure's dress consistent in texture and detail, showing no signs of artificial edges or repetitive digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is adorned in a richly decorated garment with intricate golden embroidery. The patterns appear highly detailed, featuring repeating motifs such as hieroglyph-like symbols, floral designs, and geometric shapes. These elements are rendered with a high degree of consistency in color and line thickness, suggesting careful craftsmanship. Upon close inspection, the textures of the embroidery blend seamlessly with the fabric base, exhibiting subtle variations in shading that mimic real-world textile behavior under light. There are no visible jagged lines, pixelation, or tile-like repetitions that would indicate digital artifacts. The use of gradients and highlights suggests depth and volume, consistent with realistic embroidery. Based on visual cues and knowledge of textile artistry, the patterns appear to be well-integrated and free from artificial edges or repetition. Therefore, the embroidery appears natural and cohesive.",

      "question": "Do the beads on the central figure’s headdress appear securely attached and proportionally scaled, with no floating or incorrectly positioned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The headdress in Image B is ornate, composed of a large golden structure adorned with gemstones and smaller decorative elements. The beads and jewels are arranged in clusters and along borders, appearing to be affixed to the main framework of the headdress. Their placement follows logical symmetry and balance, typical of ceremonial headwear. Each bead is proportionally sized relative to the others and the overall scale of the headdress, with no noticeable distortions or misalignments. There are no floating beads or elements that seem detached or misplaced; all components appear anchored within the design. The lighting casts soft shadows beneath the beads, enhancing their three-dimensional appearance and reinforcing their secure attachment. Given the context of traditional royal or ceremonial attire, where precision in adornment is critical, the visual consistency supports the conclusion that the beads are properly scaled and positioned.",

      "question": "Are the baskets and produce in the foreground arranged naturally, with no visible geometric distortions or unnatural overlaps between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The foreground of Image B features several woven baskets filled with various produce such as oranges, green beans, limes, and grains. The arrangement of these items appears dense yet plausible for a bustling market scene. The baskets are stacked and placed at varying angles, creating a sense of depth and realism. The produce inside each basket shows natural clustering and slight irregularities in shape and positioning, consistent with real agricultural goods. There are no obvious geometric distortions—such as warped outlines or stretched proportions—that would suggest digital manipulation. Overlaps between baskets and produce are handled with appropriate occlusion and shadowing, indicating proper spatial relationships. For example, the edge of one basket does not unnaturally intersect another without depth cues. This alignment with real-world physics and common market setups supports the conclusion that the arrangement is natural and free from artificial anomalies.",

      "question": "Are the historical symbols on the market goods (such as pottery or cloth) smoothly integrated into the surfaces, without visible seams or unnatural textural discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several market goods—including pottery and textiles—display symbolic designs. The pottery in the background has markings resembling ancient scripts or hieroglyphs, which are embedded into the surface with consistent texture and shading. These symbols follow the curvature of the pots and do not exhibit sharp breaks or abrupt transitions that would indicate digital overlay errors. Similarly, the textiles hanging in the shop display patterned fabrics with repeated motifs that flow naturally across the material, maintaining continuity in weave and color gradient. There are no visible seams, stitching artifacts, or textural inconsistencies that would suggest the symbols were pasted onto the surfaces after the fact. The integration of these designs aligns with known practices in traditional craftsmanship, where patterns are either woven or painted directly into materials. Thus, based on visual coherence and adherence to realistic material properties, the symbols appear smoothly integrated.",

      "question": "Do the central figure’s hands have five fingers each, with natural finger alignment and skin texture, and are the multiple bracelets and rings positioned without distorting the hand shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure’s hands in Image B are clearly visible, holding a small bowl. Both hands display five fingers each, with natural alignment and spacing. The knuckles, joints, and fingernails are rendered with attention to anatomical accuracy, including subtle wrinkles and age-related skin texture. The multiple bracelets and rings are layered around the wrists and fingers, but they do not compress or warp the hand structure. Instead, they conform to the natural contours of the arms and fingers, with shadows and reflections that suggest physical presence rather than digital overlay. The positioning of jewelry allows for realistic movement and space, avoiding any unnatural flattening or stretching of the limbs. This level of detail is consistent with high-quality digital rendering techniques that prioritize anatomical correctness. Therefore, the hands appear both biologically accurate and artistically coherent.",
