      "question": "Do the plush toy versions of the chicken wings retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings, such as the joint areas and wing tips, without deformation or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush toy versions of the chicken wings in Image B do not retain the correct anatomical shape and proportions of real wings. Real chicken wings have distinct joint areas and wing tips, but the plush toys appear as simplified, rounded shapes without detailed anatomical features. The lack of joints and realistic proportions indicates deformation from the original form.",

      "question": "Is the bright orange pillow placed inside the white bowl properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries without bulging or distorting the bowlâ€™s edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bright orange pillow inside the white bowl in Image B is properly scaled and shaped to fit within the bowl's boundaries. It does not bulge or distort the edges of the bowl, suggesting it fits well within the space allocated for it. This conclusion is based on observing that the pillow maintains a consistent shape and does not cause any visible strain on the bowl.",

      "question": "Does the light-colored wooden surface appear uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns and no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The light-colored wooden surface in Image B appears uniformly smooth with natural wood grain patterns. There are no visible digital artifacts or abrupt color shifts, indicating a seamless and natural texture. This analysis is based on the visual consistency of the surface across the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the golden-brown fabric of the plush wings display a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel, while remaining consistent with the appearance of soft textile material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden-brown fabric of the plush wings in Image B displays a subtle raised or granular texture that visually suggests a crunchy feel. However, this texture is inconsistent with the appearance of soft textile material, which typically has a smoother and more uniform surface. The texture here seems designed to mimic the look of crispy skin rather than soft fabric.",

      "question": "Is the orange pillow positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was, maintaining proper alignment and depth without overlapping or floating above the plate?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orange pillow in Image B is positioned in the same location relative to the plate and wings as the original sauce was in Image A. It maintains proper alignment and depth, neither overlapping nor floating above the plate. This comparison involves noting the spatial relationship between the objects in both images and confirming their consistency.",
