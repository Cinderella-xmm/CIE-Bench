      "question": "Does the metallic armor on the skater's torso and limbs maintain anatomical proportions and avoid unnatural bends or stretched shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skater is depicted wearing a highly detailed metallic exoskeleton that covers the torso, arms, and legs. The armor appears to be designed with articulated joints at the elbows, knees, and shoulders, which are positioned in a way consistent with human anatomy during mid-air motion. The limbs are bent naturally—knees are flexed, arms are extended for balance—and there are no visible distortions such as elongated segments or misaligned joints. The curvature of the armor follows the natural contours of the body, suggesting careful modeling based on biomechanics. While the design is futuristic and stylized, it preserves proportional relationships between body parts. There are no signs of unnatural stretching or bending that would suggest poor digital rendering or anatomical inaccuracies. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the pose is dynamic but physically plausible, resembling real skateboarding tricks where the body remains within biomechanical limits.",

      "question": "Is the hoverboard’s transparent deck visually consistent in shape and structure, with no broken edges or misplaced glow effects that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hoverboard in Image B features a translucent, glowing deck with a sleek, modern design. Its shape is symmetrical and maintains a smooth, continuous surface without any jagged edges, cracks, or irregularities. The transparency allows light to pass through, creating a realistic refraction effect that enhances its otherworldly appearance. The glow emanating from the board is uniformly distributed along its edges and wheels, with soft gradients that suggest internal illumination rather than external lighting. There are no abrupt color shifts, pixelation, or clipping artifacts around the edges, which could indicate poor rendering. The wheels also appear intact and properly aligned with the deck. Overall, the visual consistency and structural integrity of the hoverboard suggest high-quality digital artistry, free from common digital artifacts like broken geometry or misplaced glows.",

      "question": "Are the graffiti elements on the ramps and walls rendered as animated digital displays rather than static paint, with smooth transitions and no pixelation or jagged outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The graffiti on the ramps and walls in Image B exhibits vibrant neon colors with glowing outlines and dynamic light trails that suggest animation. Unlike static spray-painted graffiti, these designs feature luminous edges, flowing lines, and subtle pulsing effects that imply they are not physical paint but rather digital projections or holographic displays. The transitions between colors are smooth, with no visible pixelation or jagged edges, indicating high-resolution rendering. Additionally, the graffiti interacts with the ambient light and reflections in the environment, further supporting the idea that it is digitally generated. In contrast, traditional graffiti would typically have matte finishes and sharp, non-glowing borders. The presence of motion blur and light streaks around certain letters reinforces the impression of animation. Therefore, the graffiti behaves more like an interactive digital interface than static artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard cast soft, consistent glows on nearby surfaces without creating harsh, unrealistic reflections or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon highlights on the armor and hoverboard emit a soft, diffused glow that illuminates adjacent surfaces such as the ramp and the ground beneath the skater. These glows are consistent in intensity and direction, following natural light behavior—brighter near the source and gradually fading outward. The reflections on the wet pavement below are subtle and mirror the glow patterns accurately, without over-saturation or unnatural chromatic aberrations. There is no evidence of excessive color bleed (e.g., pink hues bleeding into blue areas) or harsh specular highlights that would suggest poor lighting simulation. Instead, the glow appears integrated into the scene’s lighting model, contributing to atmospheric depth while maintaining realism. This suggests advanced lighting techniques were used, such as global illumination or ray tracing, to achieve believable interactions between light sources and materials.",

      "question": "Are the motion lines positioned along the trajectory of the skater and hoverboard, following natural flow without intersecting or overlapping key features like limbs or the board in an implausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion lines in Image B are streaks of light that trail behind the skater and hoverboard, indicating speed and direction. These lines originate from the back of the skater and extend forward along the axis of movement, aligning with the expected trajectory of a mid-air jump. They curve slightly to reflect momentum and air resistance, enhancing the sense of dynamic motion. Importantly, the motion lines do not cross over the skater’s limbs or the hoverboard itself; instead, they remain outside the silhouette, preserving clarity and avoiding visual confusion. Their placement respects the physical boundaries of the figure and object, suggesting intentional design choices based on principles of visual storytelling and physics. There are no instances where the lines cut through joints or obscure critical details, which would be implausible in both real-world perception and artistic representation. Thus, the motion lines are well-integrated and follow a natural flow.",
