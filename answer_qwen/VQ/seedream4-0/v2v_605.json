      "question": "Does the Funko Pop-style box maintain a consistent texture and color scheme that aligns naturally with the theme of the gorilla, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop-style box in Image B features a design that is thematically consistent with the jungle and gorilla motif. The box uses green tones, leaf patterns, and tropical imagery that align well with the 'Jungle King' theme. The text 'POP!' and 'JUNGLE KING' are clearly legible and styled in a way typical of Funko Pop branding, which often includes bold fonts and vibrant colors. The textures on the box appear smooth and uniform, with no visible pixelation, warping, or unnatural seams. The illustration of the chibi gorilla on the box matches the figure itself, maintaining visual consistency. There are no obvious digital artifacts such as jagged edges or color bleeding, suggesting a high-quality rendering. Given that Funko Pop boxes typically have clean, stylized designs, this one adheres to those standards and maintains thematic coherence without introducing unrealistic elements.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the chibi-style gorilla figure inside the box structurally consistent and visually credible, without any distorted or deformed features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style gorilla figure inside the box follows the standard Funko Pop aesthetic, which includes an oversized head, large eyes, and a smaller body—common characteristics of chibi or kawaii design. Despite these exaggerated proportions, the figure maintains structural consistency within the genre. The limbs are proportionally balanced relative to the torso, and the facial features (such as the eyes and mouth) are symmetrical and well-defined. There are no signs of deformation, such as stretched limbs, misaligned joints, or irregular contours. The figure’s pose is natural for a collectible display item, standing upright with arms at its sides. Compared to real-world Funko Pop figures, this one appears to be accurately rendered, with no distortions that would compromise visual credibility. Thus, while stylized, it remains internally consistent and believable within the context of the toy design.",

      "question": "Does the realistic illustration of the gorilla beside the box exhibit detailed textures and lighting that enhance the lifelike appearance, without any loss of fine details or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic illustration of the gorilla beside the box is highly detailed, featuring fur texture that appears soft yet dense, with individual strands visible under the lighting. The shading and highlights suggest a natural light source coming from above, casting subtle shadows that give depth to the musculature and facial structure. The skin around the mouth and eyes shows realistic tonal variation, and the open mouth reveals teeth and tongue with accurate anatomical detail. However, upon closer inspection, there is a slight inconsistency in the lighting on the chest area—some parts appear overly dark without clear shadow progression, possibly indicating digital over-rendering. Additionally, the fur near the shoulders seems slightly too uniform, lacking the natural randomness found in real gorillas. While the overall image is impressively lifelike, these minor artifacts suggest a degree of artificial enhancement. Nevertheless, the level of detail is generally high, and the textures are mostly consistent with biological realism.",

      "question": "Is the design of the Funko Pop-style box, including the title \"JUNGLE KING,\" visually credible and free from any obvious unnatural artifacts that could detract from the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design of the Funko Pop-style box is visually credible and closely mirrors authentic Funko packaging. The logo placement, font style, and layout (including the side window and character illustration) are consistent with real Funko Pop boxes. The title 'JUNGLE KING' is prominently displayed in a bold, sans-serif font typical of the brand, and the background graphics use jungle motifs like leaves and vines, reinforcing the theme. There are no noticeable artifacts such as misaligned text, ghosting, or color fringing. The transparency of the plastic window is rendered realistically, showing reflections and refractions consistent with glass or acrylic material. Even the small details like the barcode, age rating, and product number are present and properly scaled. While the entire scene is digitally created, the box design itself appears to be faithful to real-world counterparts, making it visually convincing without introducing any obvious digital flaws.",

      "question": "Do the accessories (leafy crown, wooden staff, and jungle-themed details) accompanying the chibi-style gorilla figure appear physically rational and undistorted, contributing to the overall visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The accessories on the chibi-style gorilla figure—the leafy crown, wooden staff, and foliage belt—are designed in a way that is consistent with both the character's theme and the stylistic conventions of Funko Pop figures. The leafy crown is made of green leaves arranged in a circular pattern, resembling a laurel wreath, which is a common symbol of royalty and fits the 'Jungle King' concept. The wooden staff is textured to look like a natural branch, with bark details and tapering shape, giving it a plausible appearance. The belt made of leaves and twine complements the jungle theme without appearing out of place. All accessories are proportionally appropriate for the figure’s scale and are attached in a manner that suggests stability and balance. There are no distortions such as warped shapes, floating elements, or unnatural textures. These items contribute positively to the character’s identity and do not introduce any visual inconsistencies. Therefore, they are physically rational within the stylized context of the toy.",
