    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The word 'Breathe' is positioned in the top left corner of Image B, overlaying a dark area adjacent to the window frame and wall. The font is clean, white, and sans-serif, which contrasts well with the dark background but does not interfere with any key visual elements such as the plant or window. From a visual standpoint, the text appears to be digitally added, but it does not introduce visible artifacts like pixelation, blurring, or unnatural edges. It also does not overlap with any part of the plant, so its structural appearance remains intact. The placement respects the negative space and maintains balance without disrupting the composition. Given that text overlays in this region are typically used for inspirational messaging in nature-themed imagery, and considering the smooth integration with no visible distortion, the addition blends naturally.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The word 'Calm' is placed in the bottom right corner of Image B, near the edge of the windowsill and below the plant’s saucer. The text is semi-transparent and in a lighter gray tone, which allows it to subtly blend into the scene without overpowering the visual elements. The window frame's geometry — including its straight lines and corner angles — remains clearly defined and unaltered by the text. There is no evidence of warping, stretching, or masking of the frame’s structure. Furthermore, the text is positioned in a way that avoids overlapping with critical architectural details, preserving the plausibility of the window’s physical form. Since the text is small and placed in a less visually dense area, it integrates naturally without compromising the spatial integrity of the window.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The lighting in the image originates from the right side (outside the window), casting soft highlights on the leaves and creating realistic shadows beneath the plant. The light reflections on the upper surfaces of the leaves are consistent with natural sunlight filtering through a window, showing gradual gradients and subtle specular highlights. The addition of the words 'Breathe' and 'Calm' does not appear to alter the lighting patterns on the leaves. There are no visible shadows or highlights introduced by the text that conflict with the existing lighting direction. Moreover, the text itself is flat and lacks depth, so it does not cast any artificial shadows or reflect light in a way that contradicts the scene’s illumination. Thus, the lighting on the plant remains consistent and natural, unaffected by the text overlay.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The terracotta pot and its saucer exhibit a matte finish with slight surface texture variations typical of ceramic materials. These textures are visible in both the main body of the pot and the rim of the saucer, showing minor imperfections and color gradations that suggest authenticity. The addition of text in Image B does not cover any significant portion of the pot or saucer, and there is no visible distortion, smudging, or degradation of texture in the areas surrounding the text. The text is placed in regions where it does not interfere with the fine details of the pot’s surface. Therefore, the material appearance remains intact and consistent with real-world expectations of terracotta pottery.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The plant is centered in the frame relative to the window, with symmetrical spacing between the plant and the window edges. The positioning of 'Breathe' in the top left and 'Calm' in the bottom right creates a balanced textual layout that complements the composition without shifting the visual center of the plant. The plant’s form — including leaf arrangement, stem density, and overall silhouette — remains unchanged and proportionally accurate. The window frame retains its symmetry and alignment, with no apparent distortion caused by the text. The text is placed in corners, which are traditionally used for non-intrusive labeling in design, ensuring that the central subject (the plant) is preserved in terms of scale and spatial harmony. Hence, the proportions and symmetry of both the plant and window are maintained.",
    "answer": "Yes"
