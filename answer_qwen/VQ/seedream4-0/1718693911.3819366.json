      "question": "Are the edges of the cat’s body defined by clear, continuous, and uniform bold lines that follow its natural silhouette without distortion or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is outlined with a thick, black line that clearly separates it from the background. This outline follows the natural contours of the cat’s head, ears, torso, legs, and tail, maintaining a consistent width throughout. There are no visible distortions or gaps in the line work, and the silhouette remains intact and stylized in a way typical of graphic art or pop-art illustrations. The use of bold outlines is characteristic of vector-based or illustrative styles, which emphasize clean separation between objects and backgrounds. This suggests the artist intentionally used a uniform, continuous line to define the cat’s form, aligning with common practices in cartoon or pop-art design.",

      "question": "Is the color of the sunglasses uniformly flat orange without any reflection, gradient, or texture, and does it maintain the original shape and position on the cat’s face?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunglasses in Image B are rendered in a bright orange hue, but they do not appear uniformly flat. Instead, there are subtle gradients and highlights within the lenses—particularly visible as lighter yellow-orange reflections near the top of the lenses—which suggest light interaction and depth. These reflections mimic how real reflective surfaces behave under sunlight, even though the overall style is stylized. Additionally, the shape of the sunglasses remains consistent with their original placement on the cat’s face, matching the general form seen in Image A. However, the presence of gradients and reflections contradicts the idea of a completely flat, uniform color. Therefore, while the shape and position are preserved, the color is not uniformly flat.",

      "question": "Has the beach background been converted into solid, non-blended color blocks for the sky, ocean, and sand, with no visible texture or natural gradient transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has been transformed into a highly stylized, geometric composition using solid color blocks. The sky consists of distinct rectangular and triangular shapes in shades of pink, purple, orange, and red, with no blending between them. Similarly, the ocean is depicted with sharp, angular waves in blue and white, lacking the soft wave patterns and gradual color shifts seen in natural water. The sand is composed of large, flat areas of yellow and orange, with no texture resembling grains or natural erosion. These elements confirm that the background has been abstracted into non-blended, solid color blocks, eliminating realistic gradients and textures. This approach is consistent with pop-art or graphic design aesthetics, where naturalism is replaced by simplified forms and bold colors.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the harness depicted using a smooth gradient fill instead of realistic fabric texture, and are the shadows under the cat composed of gradient colors rather than natural light-based shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The harness in Image B features a smooth gradient fill, transitioning from darker brown to lighter tones, which gives it a stylized appearance rather than a realistic depiction of fabric texture. There are no visible weave patterns, stitching details, or material imperfections that would suggest actual textile. Instead, the harness uses flat and gradient color zones to convey depth and form. Regarding the shadows under the cat, they are rendered in solid dark blue and black tones with sharp edges, lacking the soft, diffused quality of natural light-based shading. Instead, these shadows appear to be stylistic, using flat or simple gradient fills to indicate depth, consistent with the overall graphic style of the image. Thus, both the harness and shadows conform to a non-realistic, gradient-based rendering method.",

      "question": "Are all major elements in the image—including the cat, sunglasses, hot dog, and background—rendered exclusively in red, blue, or yellow, with no other colors present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While red, blue, and yellow are dominant in Image B, they are not the only colors present. For example, the cat’s body includes cyan and white, the sunglasses have orange and red hues, the hot dog bun is tan with mustard (yellow), and the background contains purple, pink, and various shades of orange and yellow. Additionally, the harness uses brown and dark red tones. The presence of multiple colors beyond just red, blue, and yellow indicates that the image employs a broader color palette, even if it emphasizes primary colors. This expanded palette supports the vibrant, pop-art aesthetic but violates the condition of exclusive use of only red, blue, and yellow.",
