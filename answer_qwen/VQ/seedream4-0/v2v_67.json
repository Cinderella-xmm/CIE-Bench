        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunglasses are not present on the horse's face at all. Instead, the image features a small toy horse inside a decorative box labeled 'SUNSET SERENITY.' The toy horse is stylized and cartoonish, with no sunglasses or any accessories attached to it. Therefore, the question about the presence of sunglasses and their texture or artifacts is irrelevant in this context. Since there are no sunglasses in Image B, they cannot have unnatural textures or artifacts. This conclusion is based on direct observation of the visual content, which shows a miniature, non-realistic horse figure without any eyewear.",
