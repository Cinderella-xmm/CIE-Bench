      "question": "Does the figure's raised leg and upper arm maintain continuous, smooth curvature without sharp breaks or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted in a yoga pose within an illustrated book format. The raised leg is bent at the knee and extended upward, with the hand grasping the foot. Observing the curvature of the leg and the upper arm, both appear to follow smooth, anatomically plausible arcs. There are no visible sharp angles or abrupt breaks in the limbs' contours. The line work is consistent and fluid, suggesting careful artistic rendering. While stylized, the illustration maintains continuity in limb curvature, which aligns with typical human anatomy in such poses. This smoothness is preserved even in the digital art style, indicating intentional design for aesthetic and anatomical coherence.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the colors of the figure's clothing and the surrounding environment (sky, sand, water) unified in tone, with no abrupt shifts or clashing hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure wears dark gray leggings and a muted green top, which harmonize well with the soft pastel tones of the background. The sky features warm gradients from yellow to peach, while the ocean reflects these hues with gentle blues and whites. The sand is rendered in light beige, complementing the overall warm palette. There are no jarring color contrasts; instead, the palette appears intentionally cohesive, suggesting a calm, serene atmosphere typical of beachside scenes at sunrise or sunset. The clothing colors do not clash with the environment but rather blend into it, enhancing the visual harmony. This unity suggests deliberate color planning in the artwork.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the angle between the neck and torso consistent with human flexibility, and do the extended arms show smooth, uninterrupted lines without kinks or bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neck-to-torso angle in Image B shows the head tilted back significantly, which is common in advanced yoga poses like Natarajasana (Dancer’s Pose). While this extension is extreme, it remains within the range of human flexibility when performed correctly. The spine appears elongated, and the neck curves naturally backward. The arms extend smoothly from the shoulders, forming continuous lines without any visible kinks or unnatural bends. The left arm reaches upward in a graceful arc, maintaining anatomical plausibility. Although stylized, the pose respects biomechanical principles, indicating careful attention to form.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the textures on the figure’s skin and clothing show consistent shading and fine detail without visible pixelation or smeared regions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a stylized, cartoon-like illustration rather than photorealistic rendering. As such, the textures are simplified and smooth, with clean gradients applied to the skin and clothing. There is no visible pixelation or smearing, as the image appears to be vector-based or digitally painted with high resolution. Shading on the figure’s body follows light direction from the sun, creating subtle highlights and shadows that suggest depth. The clothing has uniform texture with minimal detail, appropriate for the illustrative style. Overall, the lack of artifacts indicates a polished digital artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the hand holding the foot have exactly five fingers, each with natural curvature and proper contact with the foot, without overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand grasping the foot appears to have five distinct fingers. Each finger is drawn with a natural curve, and they wrap around the foot in a manner consistent with how a human hand would grip. There is no overlap between fingers, nor are any digits missing. The thumb is positioned correctly on one side of the foot, and the other fingers wrap around the opposite side. The contact point between hand and foot is clear and anatomically reasonable. Even though the style is simplified, all five fingers are present and proportionally correct.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Is the shadow beneath the figure aligned with the sun’s position in the sky and does it taper naturally toward the horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sun is positioned behind the figure, slightly above and to the right, casting light from that direction. The shadow under the figure is cast forward and slightly to the left, which is consistent with the light source being behind and to the right. The shadow tapers gradually as it extends away from the figure, following the rules of perspective and light diffusion. It also appears to soften near the edges, mimicking natural shadow behavior. The alignment and shape of the shadow reflect accurate lighting physics, given the stylized nature of the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are there any visible halos, jagged edges, or blending errors along the outline of the figure, particularly around the raised leg and arm?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a clean, crisp outline around the figure. The edges of the raised leg and arm are smooth and well-defined, with no visible halos (glow effects), jagged lines, or blending artifacts. The transition between the figure and the background is seamless, especially noticeable where the limbs meet the sky and sand. This clarity suggests high-quality digital rendering or vector art, free from anti-aliasing issues or layer misalignment. The absence of such errors indicates professional-level execution in the illustration.",
