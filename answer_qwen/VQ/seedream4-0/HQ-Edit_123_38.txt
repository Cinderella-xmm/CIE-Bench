    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brushstroke effect is applied in a way that it covers the figure but does not disrupt the outline of limbs, head, or torso. The brushstrokes are strategically placed around the silhouette of the gymnast, enhancing the artistic style without interfering with the clear definition of her form. This conclusion is drawn by observing how the brushstrokes flow around the edges of the figure rather than over them.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The hands in Image B are enlarged and stylized, which makes them appear less anatomically accurate. They do not clearly show five fingers each, and the joint alignment appears exaggerated due to the artistic style. Additionally, there is no detailed skin texture visible on the hands, as they are part of the stylized design. Comparing this with typical human anatomy, these features suggest that the hands are not anatomically accurate.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The elongated legs in Image B form a continuous, curved line from the hips to the feet. There are no abrupt bends or discontinuities in the line of the legs, which suggests a smooth transition throughout. This analysis is based on observing the fluidity of the leg's curve and ensuring there are no breaks or unnatural angles in the depicted posture.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The blue and silver gradients in Image B are smoothly blended across the leotard and skin. There are no visible banding effects or unnatural highlights that would disrupt the gradient. The transition between colors appears seamless, contributing to a cohesive visual appearance. This assessment is made by examining the color transitions and ensuring they align with natural gradient blending principles.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The swirling ribbons and stars in Image B are placed around the figure in a manner that follows the direction of movement. They do not intersect with the body or balance beam, maintaining a clear separation between the decorative elements and the main subject. This placement enhances the dynamic feel of the image without causing visual clutter or overlap.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The matt-finish panel with rounded corners in Image B is fully visible around the image. It encompasses the entire scene without cutting off any part of the gymnast or background. The rounded corners are clearly defined, and the panel provides a complete frame for the artwork, ensuring all elements are contained within its borders.",
    "answer": "Yes"
