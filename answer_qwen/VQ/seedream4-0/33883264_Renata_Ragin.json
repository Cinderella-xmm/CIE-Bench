    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the transformed towers retain the original stone texture and structural lines, and are they shaped into arms without geometric distortion or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the towers have been transformed into arms. The visual cues suggest that the stone texture and structural lines of the original bridge are maintained in these arms. There is no geometric distortion or unnatural breaks visible; the arms appear to flow naturally from the base of the structure. This conclusion is drawn by observing the continuity of the material and design elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the suspension cables rendered as continuous, sinewy tendons with consistent metallic texture and natural curvature around the chest area, without fraying or abrupt changes in thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suspension cables in Image B are depicted as sinewy tendons across the chest area of the golem. They maintain a consistent metallic texture and natural curvature, which aligns with the expected appearance of tendons on a large figure. There are no signs of fraying or abrupt changes in thickness, indicating a careful rendering process.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the Freedom Tower transformed into a crown with clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally and are positioned directly above the golem’s head without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Freedom Tower in Image B has been transformed into a crown-like structure atop the golem's head. It features clear, faceted crystal surfaces that reflect light naturally. The positioning appears correct, directly above the head without any floating or misalignment issues, suggesting a well-executed transformation.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the skyscrapers seamlessly integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating, with no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The skyscrapers in Image B are integrated into the golem’s body as armor plating. Observing the image, there are no visible gaps, overlaps, or misaligned building edges. The integration seems seamless, maintaining the structural integrity and aesthetic coherence of the golem’s form.",

      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the golem’s base fully anchored to the ground and water, with no floating or disconnected limbs, and does its overall scale match the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golem’s base in Image B is firmly anchored to the ground and water, with no indication of floating or disconnected limbs. Its scale matches the surrounding environment, as it interacts naturally with the bridge and other structures. This suggests a successful scaling and anchoring in the digital composition.",
