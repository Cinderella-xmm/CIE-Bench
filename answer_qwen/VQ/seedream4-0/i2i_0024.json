      "question": "Does the chibi-style figure maintain the correct body proportions without any unnatural stretching or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figure in Image B has a simplified and stylized appearance, which is typical for this art style. The body proportions are exaggerated with a large head and smaller limbs, but there is no unnatural stretching or distortion that would make the figure appear deformed. This is consistent with common practices in chibi art where proportions are intentionally altered for a cute effect.",

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis ball sticker in Image B is a simple yellow circle with a basic texture indicating its spherical nature.
