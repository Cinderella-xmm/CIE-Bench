      "question": "Do the chibi car mascots retain their original car shapes and colors without any noticeable distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi car mascots are clearly designed to resemble their original car shapes and colors. The visual cues such as the overall body shape, window placement, and color scheme match those of typical cars. However, they have been stylized with exaggerated features like large eyes and smiling faces, which is a common practice in chibi art. Despite these stylistic changes, the core elements that define each car's identity remain intact. This analysis does not require comparison with Image A at this stage.",

      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the cars accurately represented in the chibi car mascots without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi car mascots in Image B do not retain fine details or textures found in real cars. Instead, they feature simplified and cartoonish designs with smooth surfaces and minimal shading. This is intentional for the chibi style but results in a loss of realistic textures. Comparing with Image A, where the cars have detailed textures and reflections, it is clear that the chibi versions lack these attributes due to their artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the cereal box design with race-themed illustrations and metallic accents appear natural and cohesive without disrupting the overall visual harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box design in Image B includes race-themed illustrations and metallic accents that complement the theme of the image. The illustrations on the box appear to be related to racing, which ties well with the chibi car mascots. The metallic accents add a touch of realism and cohesiveness to the design. There is no disruption in visual harmony as all elements seem to work together within the context of the image.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The futuristic pit stop or vibrant showroom setting in Image B is visually plausible and structurally coherent with the chibi car mascots and cereal packaging. The environment features bright neon lights and modern architecture that fit well with the playful and energetic theme of the chibi cars and the cereal box. The setting enhances the overall aesthetic without any inconsistencies.",
