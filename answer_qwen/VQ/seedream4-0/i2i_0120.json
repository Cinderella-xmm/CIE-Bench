      "question": "Does the soft vinyl figurine maintain a consistent texture and material appearance throughout, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B appears to be made of a smooth, matte material resembling soft vinyl or plastic, which is typical for collectible toys. The surface reflects light uniformly, with subtle highlights that suggest a consistent material finish. There are no visible seams, cracks, or irregularities in texture across its body, limbs, or shell. The color gradients are smooth and natural, especially on the rounded surfaces like the head and back, indicating a high-quality rendering. Additionally, the edges of the figurine are clean and well-defined, with no pixelation or distortion. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about toy materials and 3D rendering techniques, the figurine maintains a consistent texture and material appearance. No unnatural artifacts such as warping, noise, or mismatched shading are present.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and placement of the figurine on the white ceramic coffee table appropriate and physically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine is placed centrally on a white ceramic coffee table, which has a realistic scale relative to the surrounding environment. The figurine's size appears proportionate to the tea set beside it—specifically, the teacup and saucer—which are standard-sized items typically used in domestic settings. The figurine stands upright with all four feet firmly on the table surface, suggesting stable balance. Its height is consistent with what one would expect from a small collectible figure (approximately 10–15 cm tall), making it plausible for it to sit comfortably on a coffee table without appearing oversized or undersized. The shadow beneath the figurine is soft and casts naturally toward the bottom-right, consistent with ambient lighting from a nearby window. These elements collectively support a physically plausible arrangement.",

      "question": "Do the green plants blend naturally with the rest of the scene without appearing out of place or introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green plants in Image B include a variety of leafy species, such as Monstera deliciosa and possibly Ficus or Philodendron varieties, commonly found in indoor environments. Their leaves have realistic textures, natural glossiness, and shadows that align with the ambient lighting. The foliage in the background is slightly blurred due to depth of field, which enhances realism by creating a sense of distance. The plants are positioned logically around the room—some near windows, others on the floor or side tables—consistent with typical interior design practices. There are no visible signs of digital artifacts such as jagged edges, unnatural color shifts, or inconsistent lighting on the leaves. The integration of the plants into the scene feels organic and enhances the cozy, lived-in atmosphere. Therefore, they blend naturally without introducing artificiality.",

      "question": "Do the tea utensils appear correctly sized and positioned relative to the figurine and other elements, contributing positively to the scene’s visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tea set includes a small teapot and cup, both of which are proportionally accurate to real-world sizes. They are placed to the left of the figurine on the same coffee table, at a distance that allows for balanced composition without overcrowding. The size of the teacup (about 8–10 cm in diameter) is consistent with standard household ceramics, and it appears smaller than the figurine’s head, which supports a reasonable scale comparison. The positioning suggests a casual, inviting setting—perhaps a moment of relaxation. The lighting on the tea set matches that of the figurine and surrounding objects, with soft reflections and shadows indicating a shared light source. This consistency contributes to visual coherence. There is no evidence of scaling errors or misalignment that would disrupt the scene’s realism.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition free of any visible artifacts or distortions that would detract from the realistic and natural appearance of the edited image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B is highly polished and visually coherent. Lighting is soft and directional, likely simulating natural daylight coming from a window on the left, casting gentle shadows and highlights that follow physical laws. Reflections on the coffee table surface are subtle but present, adding depth. The figurine, plants, furniture, and tea set all exhibit consistent textures, colors, and lighting. There are no obvious digital artifacts such as ghosting, blurring, edge aliasing, or unnatural blending between objects. Depth of field is applied smoothly, with foreground and background elements appropriately focused. The transition between the figurine and the table surface is seamless, and there are no signs of clipping, over-sharpening, or chromatic aberration. Given these observations and the absence of visual anomalies, the image appears professionally rendered and free from distracting distortions.",
