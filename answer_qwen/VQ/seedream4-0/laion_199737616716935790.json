      "question": "Are the black and blue brick textures on the motorcycle body panels uniformly aligned and geometrically consistent with the original angular design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the motorcycle is constructed from interlocking bricks resembling LEGO or similar building blocks. The body panels are composed of black and blue bricks arranged in a pattern that mimics the angular, sporty design of a Yamaha scooter. Upon close inspection, the bricks are consistently aligned along straight edges and sharp angles, maintaining the intended geometric shape of the original design. Each brick fits into a grid-like structure, which supports uniformity. The blue elements follow the same angular contours as the black base, suggesting intentional design alignment. Given that such models are typically engineered for precision in construction, the visual evidence shows no misalignment or distortion. The overall structure adheres to the modular nature of brick-built models while preserving the original aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the cog-patterned rims maintain circular shape and evenly spaced teeth that match the wheel diameter and do not appear stretched or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B feature detailed cog-patterned rims made from black and gray bricks. Observing the rim structure, each tooth appears evenly spaced and symmetrically distributed around the circumference. The circular shape is preserved without any visible warping, stretching, or gaps between segments. The number of teeth matches the typical design seen in LEGO-style motorbike models, where precision engineering ensures structural integrity. There is no sign of deformation or breakage in the rim’s construction, and the spacing remains consistent across both front and rear wheels. This suggests careful assembly and adherence to scale, aligning with standard practices in modular toy construction.",

      "question": "Are the colorful decals seamlessly embedded into the brick surface, showing no visible gaps, overlaps, or unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decals on the side of the motorcycle in Image B include logos such as 'Y-SDI', 'VFORCE3', and others, applied over the brick surface. These decals appear to be printed directly onto the bricks or attached as flat stickers. However, upon closer inspection, the edges of these decals show slight inconsistencies—some areas seem to sit slightly above the brick surface, creating minor shadows or raised impressions. Additionally, there are subtle gaps between the decal borders and adjacent bricks, particularly near curved sections where the brick geometry changes. While the decals are generally well-placed, they do not fully integrate into the brick texture; instead, they appear layered on top, indicating a lack of seamless embedding. This is common in physical models where decals are added post-construction but may not conform perfectly to the 3D surface.",

      "question": "Is the gray baseplate flat, continuous, and properly supporting the motorcycle’s wheels without any visible elevation mismatch or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gray baseplate beneath the motorcycle in Image B consists of a grid of interlocking LEGO-like tiles. It appears flat and continuous across its entire surface, with no visible warping or unevenness. Both the front and rear wheels rest firmly on the baseplate, and there is no indication of elevation mismatch—each wheel sits at the same level relative to the ground plane. The baseplate extends under the full length of the motorcycle, providing stable support. The alignment of the baseplate with the surrounding display case also suggests it was designed to maintain even contact. No distortion or tilting is observed, confirming proper structural integrity and fit.",

      "question": "Does the display case have clear, undistorted boundaries with no ghosting, refraction errors, or unintended shadows affecting the motorcycle's appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B is transparent and encloses the motorcycle model completely. The boundaries of the case are sharp and clean, with no visible smudging or distortion. Light reflects off the surfaces in a way consistent with acrylic or glass materials, but there is no noticeable ghosting (double imaging) or refraction errors that would warp the view of the motorcycle. Shadows are minimal and fall naturally beneath the model, likely due to overhead lighting, without interfering with visibility. The reflections are subtle and do not obscure details. Overall, the case functions as an ideal showcase, preserving clarity and enhancing presentation without optical interference.",
