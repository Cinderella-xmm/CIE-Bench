      "question": "Does the cartoon transformation of the baby elephant maintain natural proportions without any noticeable distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon baby elephant in Image B is designed with exaggerated, stylized features typical of cute or kawaii-style illustrations. Its body is rounded and simplified, with large ears, a small trunk, and oversized eyes, which are common artistic choices to enhance cuteness rather than realism. The proportions are intentionally altered—such as the large head relative to the body and the short legs—to convey a childlike charm. However, these changes do not constitute 'distortion' in the negative sense but are instead deliberate stylistic decisions. There are no visible pixelation, texture artifacts, or rendering flaws that would suggest poor quality. The surface appears smooth with consistent shading, indicating high-quality digital rendering. Therefore, while not anatomically accurate, the proportions are coherent within the cartoon style.",

      "question": "Is the text \"First Splash!\" and \"Ele-Baby\" displayed with proper transparency, without obstructing underlying details or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'First Splash!' is positioned above the elephant's head in a curved layout, using a soft blue color that contrasts well against the transparent checkered background (indicating transparency). The font is clean, sans-serif, and does not overlap with any part of the elephant’s form, preserving visibility of the character. The text 'Ele-Baby' on the elephant’s belly uses alternating pink and blue colors, which are legible and integrated into the design without obscuring any important features of the character. The background is fully transparent (as shown by the checkerboard pattern), and there are no visible artifacts such as jagged edges, blurring, or alpha channel errors. The text appears to be properly layered and blended, maintaining clarity and aesthetic harmony.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the cartoon baby elephant uniformly rounded, consistent with the cute style and devoid of sharp or unnatural lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon baby elephant exhibits a highly stylized, rounded design typical of modern 3D-rendered plush-like characters. All edges—on the head, ears, limbs, trunk, and body—are smoothly curved with no sharp angles. This uniform roundness contributes to its 'cute' or 'soft' aesthetic, which is common in children’s media and toy designs. The lighting and shading further emphasize the smooth surfaces, with soft shadows and highlights that reinforce the rounded geometry. There are no abrupt transitions or jagged lines visible, suggesting careful modeling and rendering. This consistency supports the intended visual style and enhances perceived softness and approachability.",

      "question": "Does the cartoon baby elephant retain its original pose accurately, maintaining structural coherence and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pose of the cartoon baby elephant is upright and stable, with both feet firmly planted on an implied ground plane. It holds a phone to its ear with one hand, mimicking human behavior in a playful way. The trunk is slightly curled downward, which is anatomically plausible for an elephant, though stylized. The posture is balanced, with no floating limbs or unnatural joint angles. While this is not a realistic depiction, it maintains internal consistency and visual credibility within the cartoon framework. The character's stance is coherent and logical—no parts appear misplaced or disconnected. The pose is expressive and functional, contributing to the narrative of 'making a call,' which aligns with the text 'First Splash!' and 'Ele-Baby.' Thus, despite being stylized, the pose is structurally sound and believable in context.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the text well-aligned and legible, placed harmoniously on the transparent background without disrupting the visual flow of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'First Splash!' is arched above the elephant’s head, following a gentle curve that complements the circular shape of the head and ears. This placement draws attention upward and creates a dynamic entry point for the viewer. The font size is appropriate, and the color contrasts well with the background without being jarring. The text 'Ele-Baby' is centered on the belly, where it is clearly visible and integrates naturally into the character’s design. Both texts are legible due to clear contrast and simple typography. The transparent background allows the image to be used flexibly in different contexts without visual interference. There is no overlap or clutter; the composition feels balanced and purposeful. The overall layout enhances the character’s appeal without distracting from it.",
