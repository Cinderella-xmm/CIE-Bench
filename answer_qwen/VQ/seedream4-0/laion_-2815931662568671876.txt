    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The monocle on the tortilla chip appears to be proportionally sized and shaped relative to the chip. It is a small, round object that fits naturally on the chip's surface. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural shading around the monocle, suggesting it has been seamlessly integrated into the image. The visual cues such as the smooth texture of the chip and the realistic shadowing around the monocle support this conclusion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound is not realistically sized or shaped like a human hand. It appears more stylized with exaggerated features and lacks natural joint lines. Additionally, it does not emerge naturally from the guacamole; instead, it looks like an artificial addition that disrupts the texture of the guacamole. This analysis is based on the visual cues of the hand's appearance and its interaction with the guacamole.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The spice rack behind the tortilla chip respects perspective and shadow direction. It appears to be positioned at a reasonable distance and angle relative to the chip, and the shadows cast by the jars seem consistent with the light source in the scene. The spice rack blends naturally with the background, with no visible seams or color mismatches, indicating careful integration into the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The mini flag banners above the table are aligned horizontally and evenly spaced. They cast subtle shadows that are consistent with the light source in the scene, which suggests they have been integrated well into the image. There are no signs of them appearing flat or digitally pasted, as their shadows and positioning look natural within the context of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole do not appear to have been adjusted to pastel shades. The tortilla chip retains its golden-brown hue, and the guacamole maintains its vibrant green color. Both items still look visually credible as edible items, with their inherent textures preserved. This conclusion is drawn from observing the natural coloration and texture of the food items in the image.",
    "answer": "No"
