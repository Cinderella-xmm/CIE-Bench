      "question": "Does the transformed hairstyle retain a consistent volumetric structure without jagged edges or unnatural breaks in the cotton candy swirls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hairstyle in Image B is stylized to resemble cotton candy, with pastel pink and blue swirls forming a cloud-like, voluminous structure atop the head. Upon close inspection, the swirls appear smooth and continuous, with no visible jagged edges or abrupt breaks in the flow of the design. The transitions between the colors are soft and blended, suggesting a deliberate artistic choice to mimic the fluffy texture of cotton candy. This visual continuity supports the idea that the volumetric structure is maintained consistently, even though it is highly stylized. The absence of sharp lines or digital artifacts indicates that the rendering was done with attention to maintaining a natural-looking curvature and volume. Therefore, based on the visual cues and common sense regarding 3D rendering techniques for organic shapes, the hairstyle does retain a consistent volumetric structure.",

      "question": "Is the suit’s surface uniformly glossy without areas of over-saturation or unnatural reflection that disrupt the 3D paper doll illusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B has a geometric, low-poly design characteristic of a 3D paper doll or origami-style rendering. The surface appears to have a reflective quality, particularly noticeable on the shoulders and lapels, where light seems to catch on the flat facets. However, these reflections are consistent with the angular nature of the model and do not appear over-saturated or unnaturally bright. Instead, they enhance the illusion of depth and dimensionality by highlighting the edges and planes of the suit. There are no areas of excessive shine or glare that would break the cohesive paper-like aesthetic. The uniformity of the gloss across the surface suggests intentional lighting and material application to preserve the illusion of folded paper. Thus, the suit's surface maintains a balanced level of reflectivity that supports rather than disrupts the 3D paper doll effect.",

      "question": "Is the oversized tie proportionally aligned with the collar and neck area without distorting the jawline or shirt collar?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tie is significantly larger than typical proportions and features a cartoonish design with a character motif. Despite its exaggerated size, the tie appears to be centered and properly aligned with the collar of the shirt, which remains intact and undistorted. The neck area, while stylized, maintains a coherent shape that allows the tie to hang naturally from the knot. The jawline is clearly defined and does not appear compressed or warped by the presence of the tie. Although the overall style is exaggerated, the alignment between the tie, collar, and neck region is preserved in a way that respects the underlying anatomy of the figure. This suggests that the artist prioritized proportional harmony even within the stylized context. Therefore, despite the oversized nature of the tie, it does not distort surrounding facial or clothing features.",

      "question": "Are the pastel pink and blue hues smoothly blended throughout the hair without visible color banding or hard edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair in Image B is rendered as a swirling mass of cotton candy-like material with pastel pink and blue tones. Observing the gradient transitions between these colors, there are no visible bands or abrupt shifts in hue, indicating a smooth blending process. The soft diffusion of color mimics the appearance of real cotton candy, where colors typically merge seamlessly. Additionally, the edges between the swirls are rounded and fluid, lacking any harsh demarcations that would suggest digital artifacts or poor rendering. This smoothness aligns with expectations for high-quality digital art involving soft gradients, especially when aiming to replicate a whimsical, dreamlike texture. Hence, the color blending is effective and free from imperfections such as banding or hard edges.",

      "question": "Do the geometric patterns on the suit align with the garment’s seams and contours without overlapping or breaking at critical structural points?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The suit in Image B follows a low-poly, faceted design where each panel corresponds to a distinct geometric shape. These panels are arranged along logical seams—such as the lapel edges, shoulder lines, and collar folds—that mirror the construction of a real suit jacket. The patterned surfaces adhere to these structural boundaries, with no evidence of misalignment or overlap at key junctions like the collar point or sleeve attachment. Even the red pin on the lapel is positioned correctly within the geometry, reinforcing the coherence of the design. The consistency of the polygonal mesh ensures that the 'fabric' appears to fold naturally at creases, preserving the illusion of a structured garment. Given this alignment and the absence of broken edges or misplaced facets, the geometric patterns successfully conform to the suit’s intended form.",
