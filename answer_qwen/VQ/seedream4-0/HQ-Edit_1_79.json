      "question": "Are the fingers in the central panel positioned naturally over the book page, with no unnatural bending, extra joints, or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the central panel of Image B, the hand is depicted holding an open book, with the index finger pointing to a line of text. The fingers appear proportionate and aligned in a way that mimics natural human anatomy. There are no visible signs of extra joints, unnatural bends, or distorted shapes such as elongated or misshapen phalanges. The positioning of the fingers—especially the index finger extended and slightly curved—matches typical reading posture. The illustration style is clean and stylized but retains anatomical plausibility, consistent with common depictions of hands in cartoon or illustrated media. Based on visual cues and world knowledge of human hand anatomy, the fingers appear naturally posed.",

      "question": "Does the hand on the left panel transition into a tree branch with a smooth, continuous shape, maintaining five fingers and no abrupt geometric breaks or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the left panel of Image B, the hand appears to be transitioning into a tree branch. However, upon close inspection, the hand's fingers do not maintain a continuous form; instead, the forearm and hand morph into a rough, bark-like texture resembling a tree branch. The transformation begins at the wrist, and the fingers are not preserved in full—only one digit (the index finger) remains clearly defined before merging into the branch. The other fingers appear to dissolve or blend into the trunk structure, which results in a loss of anatomical continuity. This transformation introduces a surreal or symbolic element rather than a realistic one. Since the transition involves missing or incomplete digits and lacks smooth continuity between the hand and the branch, it violates the criteria for a natural or seamless morphing process. Therefore, based on visual analysis and understanding of anatomical integrity, this transition is not smooth or continuous.",

      "question": "Are the floral embellishments on the right side of the bench attached to the wooden surface without floating or misalignment, and do they have consistent lighting and shadow direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side of the rightmost panel in Image B, there is a cluster of flowers placed near the bottom edge of the frame. These flowers appear to be layered on top of the scene rather than physically attached to the wooden bench. They lack shadows cast onto the bench or background, suggesting they are floating above the surface. Additionally, their lighting does not match the ambient light source seen in the rest of the image—the petals and leaves do not show directional shading consistent with the overhead illumination present in the park setting. Instead, they seem to be digitally added elements with flat lighting. This inconsistency in shadow direction and attachment indicates misalignment and artificial placement. Therefore, based on principles of visual coherence and 3D spatial reasoning, the floral embellishments are not properly integrated into the scene.",

      "question": "Do the edges of the card panels display a natural leaf pattern with soft texture and color blending, without pixelation or unnatural line work?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The borders of the three panels in Image B are decorated with a repeating pattern of leaves in soft pastel tones. The design features subtle gradients and gentle curves, giving the impression of hand-drawn or embossed textures. There is no visible pixelation or jagged lines along the edges, and the color transitions between the leaves and the pink background are smooth. The style is consistent with decorative art commonly used in scrapbooking or illustrated storytelling, where organic patterns are rendered with attention to detail. Upon close inspection, the leaf outlines are clean and follow natural contours, and the texture resembles fabric or paper embossing rather than digital artifacts. Thus, combining visual observation with knowledge of graphic design aesthetics, the leaf pattern appears natural and well-executed.",

      "question": "Are the three panels aligned horizontally across the image, with consistent size and spacing, and do they sit within the frame without overlapping or distorting the original subject or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The three panels in Image B are arranged in a triptych format, forming a semi-circular arc that opens outward from the center. While they are roughly aligned horizontally, their arrangement is not perfectly straight—they curve gently to create a fan-like effect. However, their sizes are consistent, and the spacing between them is uniform, contributing to a balanced composition. Importantly, none of the panels overlap each other or distort the underlying content. Each panel contains a version of the same elderly woman reading, and the background elements (trees, flowers, bench) remain intact and undistorted within each panel. The curvature is intentional and stylistic, not a flaw in alignment. Given that the panels are designed to resemble a folding screen or artistic display, slight curvature is acceptable and enhances the aesthetic. Therefore, despite the arc, the panels maintain structural integrity and do not interfere with the subject or background.",
