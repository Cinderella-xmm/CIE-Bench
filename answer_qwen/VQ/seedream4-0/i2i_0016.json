      "question": "Are the clothing and hairstyle features of the players accurately represented in chibi form without artificial or distorted textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the players are depicted in a chibi art style. The clothing and hairstyles appear to be simplified yet recognizable as tennis attire and ponytails, which is typical for chibi representations. There are no visible artificial or distorted textures; instead, the lines and colors are smooth and consistent with chibi art conventions. The analysis does not require comparison with Image A at this stage.",

      "question": "Do the players' hands in the handshake pose appear natural and anatomically correct, with no missing or extra fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handshake pose in Image B shows hands that are stylized but maintain a natural appearance for chibi characters. Each hand appears to have the correct number of fingers, and they are positioned in a way that suggests a proper handshake. Comparing with Image A, the original hands were more detailed and realistic, whereas the chibi version simplifies these details while still maintaining anatomical correctness within the art style.",

      "question": "Does the semi-transparent tennis court logo integrate smoothly into the background without creating distracting artifacts or distorting the tennis court?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The semi-transparent tennis court logo in Image B blends into the background without creating distracting artifacts. It maintains the integrity of the tennis court's visual elements, such as the net and lines, suggesting a well-integrated design. This assessment is based on the visual cues present in Image B alone, as it effectively uses transparency to avoid distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tennis rackets proportionally appropriate for the chibi characters and clearly identifiable as tennis rackets without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis rackets in Image B are proportionally appropriate for the chibi characters. They are clearly identifiable as tennis rackets due to their shape and size relative to the characters. There are no unnatural distortions; the rackets are simplified but retain key features like strings and handles. This conclusion is drawn from analyzing the image independently, focusing on the relationship between the racket size and character proportions.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details like facial expressions and clothing patterns on the chibi characters been preserved without significant loss or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details like facial expressions and clothing patterns on the chibi characters in Image B are preserved in a manner consistent with chibi art. Facial expressions are exaggerated yet clear, and clothing patterns are simplified but recognizable. While there is some smoothing inherent to the chibi style, it does not result in significant loss or unnatural effects. Comparing with Image A, the original had more detailed textures, but the chibi version maintains clarity within its style.",
