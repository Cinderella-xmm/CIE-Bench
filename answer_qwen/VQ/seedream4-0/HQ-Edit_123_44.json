      "question": "Does the glass display case surrounding the aircraft have smooth, clear surfaces without visible distortion, scratches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass display case in Image B appears to be made of transparent material with clean, reflective surfaces. Upon close inspection, there are no visible scratches or distortions that would suggest imperfections in the glass. The reflections on the glass are consistent with ambient lighting and do not exhibit unnatural artifacts such as ghosting or chromatic aberration. The clarity of the aircraft inside suggests the glass is optically clear, and the edges are sharp and well-defined, indicating a high-quality rendering. There are subtle reflections from the sky and clouds, which are plausible given the environment, but they do not interfere with visibility or appear distorted. Based on these observations, the glass surface maintains visual integrity.",

      "question": "Are the leather accents and brass corners attached to the display case with accurate material textures, proper lighting response, and no visible seams or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather accents on the display case exhibit realistic texture, including natural creases and aging effects, consistent with genuine leather. The brass corners show metallic sheen and reflect light appropriately, suggesting correct material properties. The attachment points between the leather and brass fittings appear seamless, with no floating elements or gaps that would indicate poor modeling. Shadows and highlights align with the light source direction, supporting proper lighting response. The overall integration of materials looks cohesive, with no visible artifacts suggesting misalignment or clipping. This level of detail indicates careful attention to material realism and physical plausibility.",

      "question": "Is the engraved emblem on the front of the display case clearly defined with appropriate depth and shadowing, and does it blend naturally into the glass surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emblem on the front of the display case is a gold-colored insignia featuring wings and a central crest. It is positioned on the leather base, not directly on the glass surface. The engraving is detailed and shows depth through shading and highlight variations, suggesting a three-dimensional relief. However, since it is affixed to the leather rather than etched into the glass, it does not 'blend into' the glass surface. Instead, it sits as a separate element. While the emblem is well-rendered and visually coherent, the question implies integration with the glass surface, which is not accurate. Therefore, despite its clarity and depth, it does not blend into the glass as suggested by the query.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the miniature clouds positioned inside the glass case, visually separated from the aircraft, and rendered with soft, volumetric textures without clipping or unnatural transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature clouds within the display case are rendered with soft, fluffy textures and volumetric qualities typical of real clouds. They are positioned at the base of the case, beneath the aircraft, creating a sense of depth and spatial separation. There is no evidence of clipping—where the cloud geometry intersects improperly with the aircraft or case walls—and their transparency is natural, allowing partial visibility of the ground below. The lighting interacts with the clouds appropriately, casting subtle shadows and enhancing their three-dimensionality. This suggests a high-quality volumetric rendering technique was used, consistent with professional 3D modeling standards.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the propellers depicted with rotational motion blur and properly aligned with the engine nacelles, without deformation or clipping against the display case?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The propellers on the aircraft model inside the display case show signs of motion blur, particularly on the blades, which suggests rotational movement. This effect is consistent with how spinning propellers are typically rendered in dynamic scenes. The alignment of the propellers with the engine nacelles is anatomically accurate, matching historical designs of twin-engine aircraft like the Grumman TBF Avenger. There is no visible deformation of the propeller blades, and none appear to clip through the glass walls of the display case. The spacing between the propellers and the enclosure is sufficient to prevent any collision or visual artifact. Thus, both the motion representation and physical placement are correctly modeled.",
