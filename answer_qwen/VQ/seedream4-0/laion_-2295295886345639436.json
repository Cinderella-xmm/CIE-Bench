      "question": "Does the Ancient Greek-style armor fit the character’s torso and limbs without distorting muscle contours or creating unnatural gaps or overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character on the left represents an ancient warrior in Greek-style armor. The armor consists of a segmented cuirass that covers the chest and abdomen, greaves on the legs, and bracers on the forearms. Visually, the armor appears to follow the natural musculature of the torso, with the segments aligning well with the pectoral, abdominal, and deltoid regions. There are no visible gaps or overlaps that would suggest poor fitting. The armor's design is consistent with historical depictions of Greek hoplite armor, which was tailored to allow mobility while protecting key areas. The limbs appear proportionate, and the armor does not distort the underlying muscle definition. Based on visual cues and world knowledge of classical armor design, the fit seems anatomically plausible and artistically accurate.",

      "question": "Are the joints of the armored limbs articulated properly, and is the sword held in a position that does not bend or stretch the arm beyond natural limits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure in Image B is clad in full medieval-style plate armor and holds a longsword. Observing the articulation at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, the armor segments appear to allow for natural joint movement. The arm holding the sword is bent at approximately 90 degrees at the elbow, which is within the normal range of motion. The hand grips the hilt firmly, and the forearm is aligned with the upper arm, suggesting proper biomechanics. The sword extends downward from the hand, and the angle of the arm does not indicate any unnatural stretching or hyperextension. Given the typical construction of medieval armor, which includes hinges and articulated plates for mobility, the depiction aligns with realistic human anatomy and functional design. Thus, the articulation and pose are anatomically sound.",

      "question": "Is the barbell placed evenly across the shoulders with both hands gripping it in a balanced stance, and is the back posture upright and stable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rightmost figure in Image B is lifting a barbell in a front squat or clean position. The barbell rests across the upper back, just below the neck, and is centered horizontally. Both hands grip the bar with an overhand grip, spaced slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, which is standard for such lifts. The stance is wide and stable, with feet flat on the ground and knees aligned with toes. The back appears straight and neutral, indicating good spinal alignment. This posture is consistent with proper weightlifting technique, where maintaining an upright back and even bar placement is crucial for balance and safety. The visual representation reflects correct form as taught in modern fitness practices.",

      "question": "Is the head proportionally aligned with the neck and upper torso in all three versions without appearing oversized, undersized, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Across all three figures in Image B, the heads are proportionally aligned with the necks and upper torsos. In the left figure (Ancient Greek), the head sits naturally atop the neck, with the chin and jawline forming a continuous line down to the collarbone. The middle figure (medieval knight) has a helmet that covers the head but maintains proportional spacing between the top of the helmet and the shoulders. The right figure (modern lifter) has a head size consistent with human proportions, with the neck connecting smoothly to the shoulders. None of the heads appear disproportionately large or small relative to the body. The alignment of the head with the spine and torso is anatomically correct in all cases, adhering to standard human proportions used in illustration.",

      "question": "Do the hands in all three versions have exactly five fingers, proper joint curvature, and natural grip on the sword or barbell without distortion or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Examining each figure’s hands: the left figure (Greek warrior) shows both hands with five fingers each, clearly defined knuckles, and natural curvature. The right hand is clenched into a fist, while the left is open, both anatomically accurate. The middle figure (knight) holds a sword; the hand gripping the hilt has five fingers, with proper joint bending and grip pressure indicated by shading. The right figure (lifter) grips the barbell with both hands showing five fingers, with thumbs wrapped around the bar and fingers curved naturally. There are no extra digits or distortions. All hands display realistic proportions and joint articulation, consistent with human anatomy and common artistic conventions. No signs of digit multiplication or unnatural bending are present.",

      "question": "Are the shadows and highlights on the armor, clothing, and props consistent with a single light source and do they enhance the three-dimensional appearance without creating floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire composition in Image B uses high-contrast black-and-white shading with clear directional lighting coming from the upper left. This is evident from the highlights on the upper edges of armor plates, swords, and muscles, and shadows cast toward the lower right. For example, the Greek warrior’s chest plate has bright highlights on the top left and darker tones on the bottom right, consistent with a single light source. The same applies to the knight’s armor and the lifter’s musculature. Shadows under the arms, along the sides of the legs, and beneath the barbell reinforce depth and volume. There are no floating elements or inconsistent lighting effects—each shadow logically connects to its object. The use of chiaroscuro enhances three-dimensionality and realism. Therefore, the lighting is coherent and contributes effectively to the visual structure.",
