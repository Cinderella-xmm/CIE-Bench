      "question": "Does the illustrated bird retain the original bird's body proportions and head-to-body ratio without exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the illustrated bird is depicted on a tea box with a stylized, artistic rendering. The bird's proportions appear consistent with those of a small passerine, such as a warbler or canary, which typically have a rounded body and a relatively large head in proportion to their size. The head-to-body ratio seems natural and balanced, with no visible exaggeration in the head size or elongation of limbs. The wings are folded naturally against the body, and the tail length is proportional. Comparing this to typical avian anatomy and common depictions in nature illustration, the proportions align well with realistic expectations. There are no signs of distortion such as stretched limbs or an oversized beak. Therefore, based on visual analysis and general knowledge of bird morphology, the proportions are preserved accurately.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom motifs surrounding the bird evenly spaced and proportionally consistent with the original flowers in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cherry blossoms are artistically arranged around the bird, primarily along branches that frame the composition. While the flowers are not perfectly symmetrical, they follow a naturalistic distribution pattern typical of cherry blossoms on a branch. The spacing between blooms varies slightly, which is consistent with real-world floral growth patterns where clustering and gaps occur naturally. The size and shape of the blossoms appear uniform and proportionate to each other, maintaining consistency in petal count, color, and stamen detail. Compared to natural cherry blossoms, these illustrations reflect accurate botanical details. However, due to the artistic style, some minor variations in spacing may exist for aesthetic balance rather than strict realism. Nonetheless, these variations do not constitute inconsistency or disproportion. Thus, the arrangement is both visually pleasing and proportionally sound.",

      "question": "Is the typographic logo positioned at the top of the image with smooth edges and uniform spacing, free from pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typographic logo in Image B consists of two Chinese characters (茶王) placed near the top center of the box. These characters are rendered in a clean, elegant font style, likely designed for high-resolution print or digital display. Upon close inspection, the edges of the characters are sharp and well-defined, indicating no visible pixelation or blurring. The spacing between the strokes appears uniform, suggesting professional typography design. Additionally, the logo is positioned centrally at the top, adhering to common branding conventions for product packaging. Given the clarity and precision of the text, it is evident that the image has been produced at a high resolution suitable for commercial use. There is no sign of compression artifacts or low-quality rendering. Therefore, the logo meets all criteria for clarity and proper placement.",

      "question": "Does the pastel gradient background transition smoothly from one hue to another without visible banding or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a soft gradient transitioning from a light cream tone at the top to a gentle pink at the bottom. This gradient is applied across the entire surface of the tea box. Visually, there are no abrupt shifts or visible banding (also known as 'color banding'), which would appear as distinct horizontal lines if present. The transition between hues is seamless and gradual, consistent with high-quality digital gradient fills used in graphic design. Such smooth gradients are often achieved through vector-based software or high-bit-depth rendering, which minimizes quantization errors. In contrast, low-resolution images or poorly compressed files might show banding, but this is absent here. The overall effect is harmonious and aesthetically pleasing, reinforcing the premium quality of the packaging design.",

      "question": "Is the yellow color of the illustrated bird uniformly applied across its body without patches of over-saturation or loss of fine texture detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow coloration of the bird in Image B is vibrant yet carefully modulated to simulate natural feather texture and lighting effects. The shade of yellow remains consistent across the body, with subtle gradations to suggest volume and depth—such as darker tones under the wings and lighter highlights on the chest and head. These variations are intentional and realistic, mimicking how light interacts with feathers. There are no areas of unnatural over-saturation or flatness that would indicate poor rendering. Fine details like individual feather barbs are visible, especially along the wing edges and tail, showing attention to texture preservation. The use of shading enhances dimensionality without compromising clarity. Overall, the color application is both uniform in tone and rich in detail, reflecting skilled digital illustration techniques.",
