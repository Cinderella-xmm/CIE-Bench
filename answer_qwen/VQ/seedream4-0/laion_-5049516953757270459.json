      "question": "Does the LEGO representation of the avocado half retain a smooth, curved appearance with consistent brick alignment along its edge, avoiding jagged or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO avocado half is constructed using green bricks to mimic the outer skin and lighter green bricks for the flesh. The curvature of the avocado's edge is approximated using LEGO bricks, but due to the inherent blocky nature of LEGO pieces, the edge appears pixelated and jagged rather than smoothly curved. While the overall shape is recognizable, the transition between bricks creates angular steps, especially noticeable along the outer curve. This is a common limitation when representing organic curves with modular building blocks. In contrast, real avocados have continuous, smooth contours without such geometric breaks. Therefore, the LEGO version cannot fully replicate the smoothness seen in reality.",

      "question": "Are the blueberries and raspberries represented with uniformly sized round LEGO bricks that maintain their individual spherical form without flattening or merging into irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blueberries in Image B are made from small blue LEGO bricks arranged in clusters. However, these bricks are not perfectly spherical; they are flat-topped cylinders or rounded rectangles, which results in a flattened appearance when viewed from above. Similarly, the raspberries are composed of pink/red bricks stacked in a way that mimics the bumpy texture of real raspberries, but each individual 'berry' lacks true spherical form and instead has a faceted, blocky structure. Moreover, some adjacent bricks appear merged or compressed due to tight packing, leading to irregular shapes. Real berries are three-dimensional spheres with soft surfaces, while LEGO representations must compromise on form due to material constraints. Thus, the LEGO versions do not preserve the natural spherical form.",

      "question": "Does the LEGO broccoli maintain a layered, tree-like branching structure with distinct florets, avoiding overly simplified or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO broccoli in Image B is built using multiple green bricks arranged in a cluster to simulate the florets. It shows a general tree-like branching pattern with smaller groupings of bricks forming individual florets. The construction attempts to capture the complexity of real broccoli’s fractal-like structure, and the layers are reasonably well-defined. There is no significant collapse or flattening of the structure—each 'floret' remains distinct and elevated from the others. While the detail is limited by the scale of LEGO bricks, the overall form retains a plausible representation of the natural branching morphology. Compared to real broccoli, which has fine, delicate branches, this LEGO version simplifies but does not collapse the geometry. Therefore, it maintains an acceptable level of structural fidelity.",

      "question": "Is the surface of the LEGO red bell pepper smoothly curved with tightly fitted bricks, showing no visible gaps or abrupt angular transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO red bell pepper in Image B is constructed from red bricks arranged in a semi-circular, elongated shape. However, the surface exhibits clear angular transitions between brick rows, particularly along the sides and top, where the curvature is approximated through stepwise changes in height. These steps create a stair-step effect, breaking the illusion of a smooth curve. Additionally, there are minor gaps between some bricks, especially near the stem area, indicating less-than-perfect fitting. Real bell peppers have a continuous, glossy, smooth surface without such discontinuities. Due to the discrete nature of LEGO elements, achieving a truly smooth surface is impossible, and the result here reflects that limitation. Hence, the surface is not smoothly curved.",

      "question": "Does the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board follow the exact contour of the original wooden board without deviations, breaks, or irregularities in shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the outer edge of the LEGO heart-shaped board is outlined using colorful LEGO bricks arranged in a border. While the overall heart shape is preserved, the edges are composed of straight segments and right-angle turns between bricks, resulting in a pixelated or stepped outline. This contrasts sharply with the smooth, flowing curve of the original wooden heart-shaped board in Image A, which has a continuous, organic contour. The LEGO version necessarily deviates from the original due to the grid-based construction method, introducing sharp corners and irregularities at the perimeter. Even though the general form is maintained, the precise contour is not replicated. Therefore, the edge does not follow the exact shape of the original.",

      "question": "Are the LEGO asparagus stalks aligned in parallel and bound together by a LEGO representation of twine, preserving the original bundle's structure and proportion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO asparagus in Image B consists of several green rectangular bricks stacked vertically to represent stalks. These are grouped closely together and tied with a brown LEGO piece resembling twine. The stalks are generally aligned in parallel, matching the orientation seen in the original image. The binding element is positioned correctly around the middle of the bundle, just like in the real version. Although the individual stalks are blocky and lack the tapering and slight curvature of real asparagus, their relative positioning and grouping accurately reflect the original bundle’s structure and proportions. The use of string-like LEGO elements adds authenticity to the binding. Thus, despite material limitations, the LEGO version preserves the essential structural features.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO heart-shaped board placed on a uniform gray base with no visible shadows, highlights, or texture inconsistencies that suggest mismatched lighting or depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO heart-shaped board in Image B rests on a flat, gray baseplate. The surface of the baseplate is smooth and uniformly colored, with no apparent texture variations. Lighting appears even across the scene, with minimal shadows beneath the LEGO structure—only a subtle drop shadow suggesting depth. However, there is a faint gradient on the baseplate, possibly due to studio lighting, which introduces slight brightness variation. While the overall presentation is clean and professional, the presence of any shadow or highlight implies depth and lighting direction, which could be considered a mismatch if perfect uniformity were required. Nevertheless, the deviation is minimal and typical in product photography. Given the context, the base is largely uniform, but not entirely free of lighting effects. Still, it meets the standard for visual consistency in such renderings.",
