        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features and limbs added to the cookies appear smooth and proportionally consistent with the cookie size. The eyes and mouths are drawn clearly without pixelation or jagged edges, suggesting a high-quality editing process. The limbs also seem well-integrated into the cookies' design.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral pattern on the transformed plate in Image B appears continuous and evenly distributed, resembling fabric texture. There are no visible seams or unnatural stretching, indicating that the pattern has been applied smoothly across the surface of the plate.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positions of the cookie characters, chairs, and tea table in Image B suggest stable contact with surfaces and realistic depth. The objects are arranged in a manner that avoids floating or misplaced elements, contributing to an overall sense of realism in the scene.",
