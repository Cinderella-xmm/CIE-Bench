      "question": "Is the transparent showcase box fully aligned with the horse’s outline and free from visual distortions such as warped edges, double images, or unnatural light refractions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent showcase box in Image B appears to be a high-quality acrylic display case with clean, straight edges that align precisely with the contours of the horse sculpture. The clarity of the material allows for an unobstructed view of the horse without visible warping or distortion. There are no signs of double imaging, which would typically occur due to poor alignment or use of low-grade materials. Light reflections are minimal and consistent with normal surface reflection on polished acrylic, indicating no unnatural refraction. The transparency is uniform, and the edges are sharp and well-defined, suggesting professional manufacturing and proper installation. Based on these observations and common standards for museum-grade display cases, the box is correctly aligned and free from optical distortions.",

      "question": "Do the gold accents on the showcase box have uniform color and reflective properties consistent with polished metal, without unnatural highlights or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents on the corners and hinges of the showcase box exhibit a consistent metallic sheen typical of polished brass or gold-plated hardware. The color is uniform across all visible components—corners, hinges, and base fittings—with no visible discoloration or uneven plating. The highlights reflect ambient lighting in a way that matches real-world behavior of polished metal, showing smooth gradients rather than harsh or artificial glares. There is no evidence of color bleeding, where one color might bleed into another, nor are there digital artifacts like oversaturation or pixelation. These features suggest high-quality craftsmanship and realistic rendering. Given that the lighting in the image is soft and directional, the reflections remain natural and consistent with physical materials.",

      "question": "Is the brand logo clearly legible, properly centered on the black base stand, and free from pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brand logo 'CHUEN CHAS' is visible on the back panel inside the display case, not on the black base stand itself. It is positioned near the top center of the golden backdrop, not on the lower black platform. The text is clear and readable, with sharp edges and no visible pixelation or blurring. However, it is not located on the base stand as implied by the question. Since the logo is placed on the internal backdrop and not on the base, it does not meet the condition of being 'centered on the black base stand.' This discrepancy indicates a misalignment between the expected location (base) and actual placement (back panel). Therefore, even though the logo is legible and well-rendered, its position contradicts the requirement stated in the question.",

      "question": "Does the internal backdrop pattern follow the correct perspective of the box and avoid warping, tiling errors, or partial cutoffs at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The internal backdrop features an intricate geometric pattern resembling traditional Chinese motifs, possibly inspired by Zhou dynasty bronzes. The pattern is continuous and fills the entire visible area behind the horse. Upon close inspection, the lines are straight and evenly spaced, maintaining consistent proportions throughout the surface. There are no visible seams, tiling errors, or repetition artifacts that would suggest digital cloning or mismatched tiles. The pattern aligns correctly with the rectangular shape of the backdrop, and its edges appear flush with the inner walls of the case. There is no warping or distortion that would imply incorrect scaling or perspective error. This suggests careful design and printing techniques appropriate for high-end presentation displays.",

      "question": "Is the magnetic closure mechanism visibly integrated into the box structure without gaps, overlaps, or floating components that suggest mechanical impossibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The magnetic closure mechanism is visible on the right side of the display case, indicated by two small gold-colored latches near the hinge area. These latches are symmetrically placed and appear to be part of a standard magnetic locking system used in premium display cases. They are firmly attached to the frame, with no visible gaps or floating elements. The alignment of the latch with the edge of the door suggests a functional integration, and there are no signs of overlap or misplacement that would imply mechanical inconsistency. While the exact function cannot be confirmed visually, the appearance is consistent with known designs of magnetic closures in luxury display units. The absence of any floating or misplaced parts supports the conclusion that the mechanism is realistically integrated.",

      "question": "Are all visible parts of the horse sculpture (including the head, legs, saddle, and painted areas) clearly preserved and unobscured by the added packaging elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horse sculpture remains fully visible through the transparent sides of the showcase box. The front, side, and rear views of the horse—including its head, legs, saddle, and painted details—are clearly visible without obstruction. The acrylic walls are thin and clear, allowing uninterrupted viewing. The base of the sculpture rests on a flat platform within the case, and none of the structural elements of the box interfere with visibility. Even the subtle paintwork on the saddle and body is distinguishable. There are no shadows, reflections, or framing elements that obscure key features. The design of the case prioritizes visibility, ensuring that the artwork remains the focal point. Therefore, all parts of the sculpture are preserved and accessible for observation.",
