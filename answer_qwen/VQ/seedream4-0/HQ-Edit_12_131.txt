    "Question": "Q1: Are the moko tattoos on the warrior’s face, chest, arms, and back continuous and free from broken lines or pixelated textures?",
    "explanation": "The moko tattoos visible on the warrior’s face, chest, arms, and torso in Image B are rendered with high detail, featuring intricate spiral and curved patterns typical of Māori tattoo art. The lines appear smooth, continuous, and well-defined without any visible breaks, jagged edges, or pixelation. The shading and contrast suggest a digital rendering that mimics realistic ink depth and skin texture. Given the clarity and consistency of the design across all body regions, especially the facial moko which is highly detailed, it is evident that the artwork avoids artifacts such as aliasing or low-resolution textures. This level of precision indicates careful digital painting or 3D modeling techniques, ensuring visual coherence. There is no sign of distortion or fragmentation in the tattoo lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the flax fibers of the piupiu skirt and leg wraps maintain natural variation in length, thickness, and shading without appearing overly smooth or synthetic?",
    "explanation": "The piupiu skirt and leg wraps in Image B are composed of layered flax fibers, depicted with varying lengths and thicknesses. The individual strands show subtle differences in tone and shadow, contributing to a textured, organic appearance. The lighting casts soft shadows between the layers, enhancing the sense of depth and realism. These details suggest intentional artistic effort to simulate natural flax material rather than a uniform, synthetic-looking surface. While some digital smoothing may be present due to rendering, the overall effect remains faithful to traditional Māori attire, where flax fibers naturally vary. Therefore, the textures avoid an overly polished or artificial look.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the warrior’s limbs positioned naturally with correct joint alignment and muscle tension, avoiding exaggerated or impossible bends?",
    "explanation": "The warrior’s posture in Image B shows a wide stance with bent knees and arms extended outward, consistent with a traditional haka pose. The joints—particularly at the elbows, shoulders, hips, and knees—are aligned anatomically correctly. Muscle definition is prominent but proportionate, indicating tension appropriate for the dynamic stance. There are no signs of unnatural bending, such as hyperextended joints or distorted limb proportions. The pose is physically plausible and reflects real human biomechanics during expressive movement. This suggests that the artist has maintained anatomical accuracy while capturing the intensity of the performance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the carved-wood title banner have realistic wood texture, proper shadowing, and edge integration with the background without appearing to float or clip unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "The wooden banner above the warrior features engraved Māori-style patterns and exhibits a convincing wood grain texture with variations in color and depth. It casts a soft shadow beneath itself, suggesting depth and three-dimensionality relative to the background. The edges blend smoothly into the scene, with no harsh clipping or floating effect. The perspective matches the angle of the frame and background landscape, reinforcing its integration into the composition. The lighting appears consistent with the ambient light source in the scene, further enhancing realism. These elements collectively indicate careful attention to material simulation and spatial coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the stat bars clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned without overlapping or distorting the warrior’s figure or background elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stat bars are located at the bottom corners and center of the image, placed over the rock and foreground vegetation. They are clearly readable with distinct labels and colored indicators (e.g., Courage +10, MANA +9). The spacing between them is even, and they do not overlap with the warrior’s body or key background elements like the legs or skirt. However, the left-side stat bar partially overlaps the lower part of the warrior’s leg wrap, though only minimally. Despite this minor intrusion, the majority of the figure remains unobstructed, and the text is fully legible. Overall, the layout is functional and stylistically integrated into the card design without significant distortion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the metallic frame edges have uniform thickness, smooth curves, and realistic reflections that align with the lighting direction in the scene?",
    "explanation": "The metallic frame surrounding Image B has consistent thickness along its border, with rounded corners and smooth curvature. The reflective surfaces exhibit highlights and gradients that suggest a light source from the upper left, matching the ambient lighting of the scene. The reflections are subtle but coherent, showing a polished metal finish without abrupt transitions or inconsistencies. The frame's design complements the fantasy card aesthetic and integrates well with the overall composition. There are no visible distortions or unevenness in the frame’s structure, indicating high-quality digital craftsmanship.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Is the nameplate positioned centrally beneath the warrior, with appropriate size and material texture that matches the stylistic theme without visual dissonance?",
    "explanation": "The nameplate in Image B is centered directly below the warrior, aligned horizontally with the composition. Its size is proportionate to the figure and frame, neither too large nor too small. The material texture resembles aged parchment or leather with metallic trim, fitting within the fantasy-themed card design. The font style and decorative elements harmonize with the overall aesthetic, including the wooden banner and metallic frame. There is no visual clash or imbalance; the nameplate enhances the thematic consistency without drawing undue attention away from the central figure. Thus, it is both functionally and stylistically well-integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
