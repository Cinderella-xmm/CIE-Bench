      "question": "Are all six dolls proportionally scaled with consistent body structure, showing no distorted limbs, oversized heads, or irregular shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the six dolls are arranged in descending size order from left to right, resembling a traditional matryoshka (Russian nesting doll) set. The largest doll on the far left is clearly the tallest and widest, while each subsequent doll decreases in size proportionally. Their body structures—specifically head-to-body ratios and limb proportions—are consistent across the series. The heads are not oversized relative to the bodies, and limbs appear balanced and symmetrical. There are no visible distortions such as elongated arms or legs, nor any irregular shapes that suggest deformation. This consistency in scaling and anatomy aligns with typical design principles of matryoshka dolls, where proportional reduction is key. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of standard doll craftsmanship, the dolls appear proportionally scaled and structurally sound.",

      "question": "Do all six dolls clearly display the original figure’s beard, headwear, and distinctive robe patterns in a simplified but consistent manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original image (Image A) shows a historical Chinese figure, likely Confucius, with a long beard, a blue headband, and an ornate robe with swirling patterns and layered fabric. In Image B, the central male doll directly reflects these features: it has a beard, a blue headband, and a robe with similar blue-and-orange decorative motifs. However, the other five dolls—four female figures—are stylized differently, featuring large eyes, simplified facial features, and traditional Russian-style headdresses and clothing, which are inconsistent with the original figure's appearance. While the male doll retains the key traits, the female dolls do not represent the original figure at all. Thus, only one doll displays the original figure’s characteristics, and even then, it is adapted into a cartoonish style. The rest diverge significantly. Therefore, the answer must reflect that not all dolls display the original figure’s traits.",

      "question": "Is the dark-wood desk textured realistically with visible grain, proper shadows, and correct scale relative to the dolls, and is it fully grounded beneath them without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The desk in Image B appears to be made of dark wood with visible grain patterns, particularly noticeable on the surface and edges, suggesting realistic texturing. It includes carved details, brass handles, and a cabinet door, all consistent with high-quality furniture design. Shadows under the desk and along its base indicate proper lighting and grounding, and there is no indication of floating or misalignment—the dolls sit firmly on the surface, and the desk rests evenly on the floor. The scale of the desk relative to the dolls is appropriate; it is large enough to support the largest doll comfortably, and the height seems consistent with real-world furniture. Based on visual cues and common sense about furniture representation in digital art, the desk appears well-rendered and physically plausible.",

      "question": "Do the robes on the dolls exhibit smooth, curved folds consistent with a breeze, without jagged lines, unnatural stretching, or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robes on the dolls in Image B show stylized folds, especially on the larger dolls, with curved lines suggesting movement, possibly from a breeze. These folds are smooth and follow natural draping patterns for fabric, particularly on the central male doll and the largest female doll. There are no jagged lines or sharp breaks in the texture. The fabric appears continuous and undistorted, with no signs of unnatural stretching or pixelation. The artistic style is cartoonish but maintains coherence in how the robes flow. Given that this is a stylized representation rather than photorealistic, the folds are appropriately rendered within the context of the artwork. Therefore, the robes are depicted with consistent, smooth curvature suitable for their design.",

      "question": "Do all dolls have hands with exactly five fingers, properly shaped and spaced, without extra digits or deformed joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the dolls in Image B, the hands are stylized and simplified. The largest female doll and others have hands shown in front of their bodies, clasped together. However, due to the cartoonish and symbolic nature of the design, the fingers are not individually detailed. Instead, they are represented as broad, rounded shapes with no clear delineation of individual fingers. For example, the hands appear as two ovals or blocks with minimal segmentation. There are no visible extra digits, but neither are there five distinct fingers. This simplification is common in children's toys and folk art like matryoshka dolls, where anatomical accuracy is sacrificed for aesthetic appeal. Since the question requires 'exactly five fingers' and 'properly shaped,' and the hands do not meet this criterion due to abstraction, the answer must reflect that the requirement is not fulfilled.",

      "question": "Are the orange and blue colors consistently applied across all six dolls without color bleeding, mismatched tones, or unexpected gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dolls in Image B use a dominant palette of orange and blue, which is applied uniformly across all figures. The orange is used for the outer garments, and blue for accents, trim, and inner layers. There is no visible color bleeding—where one color bleeds into another unnaturally—nor are there mismatched tones or unexpected gradients. The color application is clean and deliberate, with sharp boundaries between hues. Even though the style is stylized, the color consistency is maintained across all dolls, suggesting intentional design. The same pattern and color scheme repeat across the figures, indicating careful rendering. Therefore, based on visual analysis and standards of digital art consistency, the colors are applied uniformly and correctly.",
