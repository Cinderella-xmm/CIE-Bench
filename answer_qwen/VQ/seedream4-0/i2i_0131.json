      "question": "Do the refrigerator doors and handles appear proportionally correct and geometrically consistent with typical refrigerator designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both refrigerators feature side-by-side door configurations with vertical handles, which is a common design for modern French-door refrigerators. The handles are centered on each door and extend vertically from top to bottom, maintaining symmetry and alignment consistent with real-world appliances. The width of the doors appears proportional to the overall height, and the spacing between the two doors on each unit is standard. The top freezer compartments are also aligned properly above the main fridge sections. These visual cues align with typical refrigerator proportions and geometry, suggesting no significant distortion or scaling errors. Furthermore, the placement of the water dispensers near the lower portion of the left-hand door follows industry-standard positioning. There is no indication of disproportionate sizing or misalignment in either unit.",

      "question": "Are the metallic surfaces of the refrigerator free from unnatural textures, maintaining a consistent and authentic finish throughout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic surfaces of the refrigerators in Image B exhibit a brushed stainless steel finish, which is typical for high-end appliances. The texture appears uniform across both units, with subtle gradients that suggest light reflection and depth, consistent with real stainless steel. There are no visible pixelation, unnatural patterns, or artificial sheen that would indicate digital artifacts. The reflections and highlights follow logical lighting directions, enhancing the realism. However, upon closer inspection, especially in the lower portions of the doors, there is a slight gradient shift—possibly due to rendering effects—that might be interpreted as an over-smoothed transition. But overall, the surface maintains a coherent and realistic appearance without obvious textural inconsistencies. This suggests the finish is largely authentic and well-rendered.",

      "question": "Does the lighting appear uniform across both refrigerators, without noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to originate from multiple sources: ambient daylight through the windows and under-cabinet lighting on the left side. The refrigerators reflect this lighting with soft highlights on their upper portions and gradual shading toward the bottom, which mimics how light interacts with reflective metal surfaces. Both units show consistent illumination patterns, with no abrupt changes or conflicting shadows. However, there is a subtle difference in brightness between the two refrigerators—the one on the right appears slightly brighter, possibly due to its proximity to the window. While this could be seen as a minor inconsistency, it is plausible given real-world lighting conditions. No harsh shadows or unnatural glares are present, and the reflections remain smooth and coherent. Therefore, the lighting is generally uniform and realistic.",

      "question": "Are there smooth transitions where the refrigerators meet the cabinets, without visible seams or edges that break the visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the refrigerators are positioned between dark gray cabinetry, and the integration appears seamless. The top of each refrigerator aligns perfectly with the base of the overhead cabinets, and the sides abut the adjacent cabinets without gaps or misalignments. The flooring continues uninterrupted beneath the units, and the grout lines and trim match the surrounding environment. There are no visible seams, cracks, or floating edges that would suggest poor modeling or rendering. The bottom vents of the refrigerators are flush with the floor, and the overall composition maintains architectural continuity. This level of detail indicates careful attention to spatial relationships and visual coherence, supporting the conclusion that the transitions are smooth and realistic.",

      "question": "Are the water dispensers on both refrigerators clearly defined and positioned appropriately, contributing to the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both refrigerators in Image B feature water dispensers located on the left-hand door, near the lower third of the panel. This placement is consistent with standard refrigerator designs, where the dispenser is accessible yet not obstructive. The dispensers include control panels, levers, and spouts, all of which are clearly rendered and proportionate to the door size. The black bezels around the dispensers contrast appropriately with the stainless steel surface, enhancing visibility without appearing out of place. The details such as buttons and labels are legible and stylistically appropriate. There is no distortion or misalignment in the dispenser components, and they appear functional and integrated into the appliance’s design. Given these observations, the dispensers contribute positively to the realism of the scene.",
