      "question": "Does the person appear naturally integrated into the scene without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a person is partially visible on the left side of the frame, showing only their lower body from the waist down. The person is wearing dark pants and shoes and appears to be walking alongside the zebra. The lighting on the person matches the warm, golden sunlight illuminating the rest of the scene, suggesting consistent environmental lighting. However, the edge where the person's leg meets the ground shows a slightly sharp and clean cut, which is suspicious in natural photography. Additionally, the shadow cast by the person is minimal and does not align perfectly with the direction of the light source, which could indicate digital insertion. While the textures of clothing and skin tone appear plausible, the overall integration lacks subtle depth cues and blending that would be expected in a real photograph. Therefore, there are signs of digital manipulation, such as inconsistent shadows and edge artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the zebra's head turned in a way that looks natural and plausible for a startled reaction?",
      "choices": [
        "yes",
        "no"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B has its head turned sharply to the right, away from the water source, with ears perked up and eyes wide open. This posture is consistent with a startled or alert animal reacting to a sudden presence—such as the nearby human. In the wild, zebras often react to potential threats by turning their heads quickly and assessing danger. The angle of the neck bend and the positioning of the ears suggest an active, reactive stance rather than a passive one. From a biological standpoint, this movement is anatomically feasible for a zebra, and the muscles and joints involved in such a turn appear consistent with natural biomechanics. Thus, the head turn is both visually and behaviorally plausible for a startled response.",

      "question": "Are the zebra's stripes clear and detailed without any unnatural blurring or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra’s stripes in Image B are sharp and well-defined, with consistent black-and-white contrast across its body. There is no visible blurring, smudging, or pixelation along the edges of the stripes, especially noticeable around the legs and torso. The pattern remains continuous and symmetrical, following the natural variation seen in real zebras. Even in areas where the zebra is in motion (e.g., the tail and hind legs), the stripes retain clarity and do not exhibit ghosting or warping effects. This suggests high-resolution rendering and careful attention to detail, likely indicating either a high-quality photograph or a very realistic digital composition. No visual anomalies suggest artificial manipulation in this region.",

      "question": "Does the person's foot look like it is realistically pressing down on the zebra's tail without breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the person's foot appears to be positioned directly beneath the zebra’s tail, with the heel making contact. However, upon closer inspection, the zebra’s tail seems unnaturally compressed or flattened under the weight of the foot. The curvature of the tail does not follow typical biomechanical behavior when pressed by an external force—it lacks the slight bending or displacement that would occur in reality. Furthermore, the foot’s placement appears too close to the base of the tail, and the interaction between the two objects lacks soft deformation or shadowing that would suggest physical contact. The geometry of the tail’s tip seems distorted, as if digitally manipulated to fit the foot. This indicates a failure to maintain realistic physics in the interaction.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the person maintain the overall composition and layout of the scene without disrupting the natural setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original scene (Image A) features a zebra drinking water near a rocky embankment, with natural lighting and a serene, undisturbed environment. In Image B, the introduction of a human figure changes the narrative significantly. While the person is placed within the same environment and lighting conditions, their presence introduces an element of unnatural intrusion. Zebras are typically wary of humans and would not allow close proximity without fleeing or showing strong defensive behavior. Moreover, the spatial relationship between the human and the zebra feels forced—the person is too close, and their positioning suggests they are walking casually beside a wild animal, which contradicts typical wildlife behavior. This disrupts the naturalness of the setting and alters the intended mood of the image. Although the background and lighting remain consistent, the addition of the person undermines the authenticity of the scene.",
