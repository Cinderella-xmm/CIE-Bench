      "question": "Does the keychain with the chibi-style German Shepherd appear naturally integrated into the scene without disrupting the overall realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B is a stylized, cartoonish representation of a German Shepherd, rendered in a chibi art style with exaggerated features such as large eyes and a simplified body shape. This design is inherently non-realistic and contrasts sharply with the naturalistic appearance of the human hand and background. The keychain's bright colors, bold black outlines, and plastic-like texture are inconsistent with real-world materials and proportions when compared to the organic textures of skin and the neutral environment. While it is clearly placed in a realistic setting (a hand against a plain background), its artificial and playful design disrupts the realism of the scene. Therefore, despite being physically present in the image, it does not integrate naturally due to its intentional stylistic departure from reality.",

      "question": "Are the soft rubber texture and bold black outline of the keychain clearly visible and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The keychain in Image B displays a distinct soft rubber texture, indicated by subtle surface shading and slight depth variations that suggest flexibility and material thickness. The bold black outline surrounding the entire figure is sharp and consistent, defining the edges of the character clearly. There are no visible pixelation, jagged lines, or color bleeding that would indicate digital artifacts. The rendering of the material appears smooth and uniform, with appropriate highlights and shadows that enhance the three-dimensional effect. These visual cues align with typical high-quality 3D-rendered or photographed rubber keychains. Thus, the texture and outline are both clearly visible and free from unnatural distortions.",

      "question": "Is the small silver keyring proportionate and logically attached to the keychain without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silver keyring in Image B is connected to the top of the keychain via a small metal chain link. Its size is appropriately scaled relative to the keychain—neither too large nor too small—and matches common real-world keyring dimensions. The attachment point is centered at the top of the keychain’s head, which is a standard placement for such items. The chain links are evenly spaced and show no signs of stretching, warping, or misalignment. The metallic sheen and reflective properties are consistent with polished steel or aluminum, and there are no visual anomalies such as clipping or floating elements. Given these observations, the keyring is proportionate and logically integrated into the design.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the keychain display a natural grip and anatomically correct finger positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B shows a relaxed, open palm with fingers slightly curved, cradling the keychain. The thumb is positioned on one side, while the other fingers support it from behind. The spacing between the fingers is consistent with normal hand anatomy, and the curvature of the knuckles and joints appears natural. There is no evidence of unnatural bending, overlapping, or disproportionate length. The lighting and shadowing across the hand follow realistic patterns, suggesting proper depth and form. No distortions or digital artifacts are visible in the skin texture or fingernails. All these factors indicate that the hand is depicted with accurate anatomy and a natural grip.",

      "question": "Has the neutral background been maintained without any unintended alterations or additions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a plain, light beige or off-white surface with no visible patterns, textures, or objects. It is uniformly lit and lacks any shadows, reflections, or digital noise that might suggest post-processing errors. The edge of the hand and keychain blends smoothly into the background without any haloing, blurring, or color bleed. There are no unexpected elements such as text, logos, or foreign objects introduced into the scene. The simplicity and consistency of the backdrop suggest that it was intentionally kept neutral and unaltered, serving as a clean canvas to highlight the keychain. Therefore, the background has been preserved without unintended modifications.",
