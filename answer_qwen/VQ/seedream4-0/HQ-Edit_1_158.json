      "question": "Does the silhouette of the woman maintain correct anatomical proportions and avoid geometric distortions such as misaligned limbs, unnatural bends, or missing body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is rendered in a paper-cut style, where the human form is represented by layered cutouts. The silhouette of the woman appears to have a head, torso, arms, and legs, all positioned in a seated posture consistent with the chair. However, the head is featureless and lacks facial details, which is intentional for the artistic style. Despite this abstraction, the limbs are proportionally aligned—arms extend naturally from the shoulders, hands hold the book, and legs rest appropriately on the chair. There are no visible misalignments or unnatural bends. The use of negative space and intricate cutwork does not compromise the overall anatomical structure; rather, it enhances the stylized representation. While the figure is simplified, the proportions remain consistent with human anatomy in a seated position. Therefore, despite being abstracted, the silhouette maintains correct anatomical proportions within the constraints of the medium.",

      "question": "Is the enlarged book proportionally consistent with the woman’s hands and arms, and does it not appear to float or clip through the chair or body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is crafted from the same cardstock material as the figure and is held open in front of the woman. Its size relative to the hands appears proportional, with fingers wrapped around the spine and pages, suggesting a natural grip. The book is positioned centrally in the lap area, supported by the arms and not floating above or clipping through any part of the body or chair. The layers of the book are clearly defined, and its thickness aligns with the depth suggested by the hand positioning. There is no visual indication of floating or intersection with other elements, such as the chair back or seat. The paper art technique allows for precise layering, ensuring spatial coherence. Thus, the book remains grounded and proportionally consistent with the figure's hands and arms.",

      "question": "Are the lace details on the sweater seamlessly integrated with the original knit texture, showing no signs of unnatural edges, repeating patterns, or material inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sweater in Image B is made entirely of cut paper, with intricate lace-like patterns carved into the surface. These patterns are highly detailed and resemble traditional knitted textures, but they are not actual fabric—they are artistic representations using negative space. The design includes circular motifs, mesh-like openings, and symmetrical patterns that mimic lacework. While the texture is consistent across the garment, the repetition of these patterns is deliberate and stylistic, not accidental. In paper art, such uniformity is expected and acceptable. There are no visible jagged edges or inconsistencies in the material, as all elements are part of the same cardstock layer. The integration of the lace pattern with the turtleneck and sleeves appears seamless within the context of the medium. Although it's not real fabric, the design successfully emulates textile detail without introducing artificial artifacts. Hence, within the constraints of the paper-cut style, the lace details are well-integrated and visually coherent.",

      "question": "Do the simplified bookshelves maintain coherent shelf structure with aligned edges and realistic spacing between books, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookshelves are constructed from blue cardstock, forming a backdrop behind the seated figure. The shelves are depicted as horizontal lines with vertical supports, and books are arranged in stacks of varying heights. While simplified, the shelves maintain straight edges and consistent alignment, creating a sense of depth and order. The spacing between books varies slightly but follows a plausible arrangement typical of a library setting. Some books are tilted or stacked unevenly, which adds realism to the scene. No books appear to float unsupported or clip through the shelf edges. The entire structure is layered and dimensional, with shadows suggesting depth. The design respects basic architectural logic—horizontal shelves supported by vertical frames—with no visible misalignment. Therefore, despite being stylized, the bookshelves retain structural coherence and realistic spacing.",

      "question": "Is the antique-gold cardstock background uniformly textured and lit, with no abrupt edges or lighting mismatches that separate it from the central figure and other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a solid antique-gold cardstock surface, providing a warm, neutral backdrop for the scene. The texture appears uniform across the entire surface, with subtle variations that suggest a matte finish typical of high-quality paper. There are no visible seams, sharp edges, or sudden changes in tone that would indicate poor layering or lighting inconsistency. The lighting seems evenly distributed, with soft shadows cast by the cutout figures, suggesting a single light source from above or slightly in front. These shadows blend naturally into the background, enhancing the three-dimensional effect without creating harsh contrasts. The central figure and surrounding elements (chair, books, cat) are cleanly cut and placed against the background without any gaps or misalignments. The transition between the background and foreground elements is smooth, maintaining visual harmony. Therefore, the background is uniformly textured and lit, with no abrupt separations.",
