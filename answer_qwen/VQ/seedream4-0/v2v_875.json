      "question": "Are the edges of the palm tree and cactus seamlessly integrated into the Polaroid frame without visible artifacts or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the palm tree and the real cactus (background elements) are visible within the Polaroid frame. The edges of these elements align with the frame's boundaries, but they are not seamlessly blended into the frame’s edge. Instead, the image inside the Polaroid appears as a clean cutout, suggesting a digital composite. There is no visible distortion or artifact along the edges of the palm tree or the cactus inside the frame, which indicates careful masking. However, since the frame acts as a hard border, the integration is not seamless in the sense of continuity beyond the frame—rather, it is a deliberate design choice to present a photo-like effect. Given that the goal is visual coherence within the frame, the edges appear clean and natural within the context of a photograph. Therefore, despite being a cutout, there are no visible artifacts or unnatural breaks.",

      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style cactus maintain its original green color and texture, avoiding unnatural color shifts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style cactus in Image B is rendered in a stylized, cartoonish manner. Its primary color is a consistent bright green, typical of such animated characters. The texture includes small white spines evenly distributed across its body, maintaining uniformity and clarity. There are no noticeable color shifts—such as discoloration, gradients, or unnatural highlights—across its surface. Additionally, the details like the facial features, arms, and legs are sharp and well-defined, indicating high-resolution rendering. This consistency suggests that the model preserves the intended aesthetic without degradation. Compared to realistic plants, this is an artistic interpretation, but within its own style, it maintains fidelity in color and texture.",

      "question": "Does the human hand holding the Polaroid photograph appear anatomically correct with natural skin texture and no more than five fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B shows a thumb and four fingers clearly gripping the Polaroid frame. The number of fingers is five, which is anatomically correct. The skin texture appears smooth and realistic, with subtle shading and natural creases around the knuckles and fingertips. The lighting on the hand matches the ambient light of the scene, casting soft shadows consistent with a sunlit environment. There are no distortions, extra digits, or unnatural proportions. While the hand is slightly stylized (possibly due to 3D rendering), it remains within plausible human anatomy and exhibits no obvious errors. Therefore, based on visual cues and common knowledge of human anatomy, the hand is correctly represented.",

      "question": "Is the transition where the 3D chibi-style cactus appears to break out of the Polaroid frame smooth and believable, without any distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi-style cactus is positioned so that part of its body extends beyond the bottom edge of the Polaroid frame, creating a 'breaking out' effect. This transition is smooth in terms of geometry—the cactus’s limbs and body maintain consistent shape and proportion as they extend outside the frame. There are no jagged edges, pixelation, or clipping artifacts that would suggest poor compositing. The shadow beneath the cactus’s feet also suggests depth and grounding, enhancing the illusion of breaking through the plane of the photo. While this is a creative and surreal element, the geometric integrity of the cactus is preserved, and the transition is visually coherent. Thus, it is believable within the context of the image’s artistic intent.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the palm tree, cactus, and the 3D chibi-style cactus align naturally with the light source in the image, avoiding any artificial highlights or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall lighting in Image B suggests a bright, sunny day with a clear blue sky. The palm tree and background cactus cast subtle shadows consistent with overhead sunlight, and their surfaces show highlights on upper-facing areas, indicating a top-down light source. The 3D chibi-style cactus has similar lighting: its upper surfaces are brighter, and shadows fall beneath it and to its sides, matching the direction of light from above. Notably, the shadow under the chibi cactus’s feet aligns with the angle of the light, reinforcing spatial coherence. There are no harsh, unrealistic glares or mismatched shadows. The lighting across all elements is harmonious and consistent with a single directional light source. Therefore, the lighting and shadows are natural and aligned with the scene’s illumination.",
