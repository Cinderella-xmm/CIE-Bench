      "question": "Is the outline of the purple blouse magnet smooth and symmetrical, with recognizable embroidered patterns intact and not blurred or fragmented?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The purple blouse magnet in Image B is a stylized representation of a traditional Indian blouse. Visually, its outline appears smooth and symmetrical, conforming to the typical shape of a short-sleeved blouse with a V-neckline. The embroidered patterns, depicted as small, colorful gem-like elements and intricate designs along the neckline and sleeves, are clearly defined and evenly spaced. There is no visible blurring or fragmentation of these patterns, suggesting that the design has been rendered with care and precision. The symmetry and clarity align with common design practices for decorative magnets, where sharpness and recognizability are prioritized. Based on visual inspection and general knowledge of how such items are manufactured (e.g., using screen printing or digital engraving), this level of detail is consistent with high-quality production.",

      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the lehenga magnet evenly spaced and symmetrically arranged, with no broken or misaligned designs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lehenga magnet in Image B features a patterned skirt design resembling traditional Indian embroidery. The floral motifs are arranged in vertical columns, each containing a central ornamental element flanked by smaller patterns. These motifs appear evenly spaced and symmetrically aligned across the fabric surface of the magnet. There is no evidence of broken lines, misalignment, or irregular spacing that would suggest distortion or poor rendering. In real-world textile designs, such symmetry is often achieved through careful drafting or digital replication. The magnet’s depiction maintains this consistency, indicating intentional and accurate design execution. Therefore, based on both visual cues and understanding of patterned textile artistry, the arrangement is orderly and well-executed.",

      "question": "Does the red dupatta magnet show a natural curve at the edge, with the border pattern consistently aligned and not stretched or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red dupatta magnet in Image B displays a flowing, draped appearance typical of a traditional Indian veil. Its edge curves naturally, mimicking the soft fold of fabric. The border pattern along the dupatta's edge consists of repeated geometric and floral elements that are consistently aligned and evenly spaced. There is no visible stretching or distortion in the pattern, which suggests that the design was scaled proportionally during creation. In real-life textiles, such borders are often woven or printed with precision to maintain alignment. The magnet replicates this accurately, preserving the integrity of the pattern despite its simplified form. Thus, based on visual analysis and knowledge of textile design principles, the dupatta’s representation is faithful and undistorted.",

      "question": "Are the jewelry elements (maang tikka, earrings, bangles) depicted with clear outlines and consistent metallic sheen, without merged or malformed components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jewelry elements—such as the maang tikka, earrings, and bangles—are represented on various magnets. The maang tikka on the central figure is shown as a detailed ornament with a central pendant and dangling elements; its outline is crisp and the metallic sheen is uniformly applied. Similarly, the earrings on multiple figures have distinct shapes with visible studs and drops, maintaining clear separation between components. The bangles, especially on the two red circular magnets, are stacked neatly with consistent spacing and reflective surfaces, indicating a metallic finish. There are no signs of merging or deformation—each component remains distinct and properly proportioned. This reflects standard practices in illustrative design for collectible magnets, where clarity and aesthetic appeal are emphasized. Therefore, based on visual inspection and expectations for such decorative items, the jewelry is well-rendered.",

      "question": "Is the background wall pattern magnet composed of repeated motifs that are evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background wall pattern in Image B is part of the overall scene behind the magnets, but it is not itself a separate magnet. However, interpreting the question as referring to the decorative wallpaper-like pattern visible in the upper-right corner of the image, we observe a subtle damask-style motif with repeating floral and geometric elements. These motifs are evenly spaced and aligned in a grid-like fashion, typical of traditional wallpaper designs. There are no visible seams or distortions, suggesting a continuous print. While the pattern is faint and serves as a backdrop rather than a focal point, its regularity and lack of disruption support the conclusion that it is well-designed and consistent. Given that such patterns are commonly used in interior decor for their symmetry and elegance, the observed layout aligns with standard design practices.",

      "question": "Do all six magnets have visibly rounded edges and a uniform glossy surface without uneven reflections or dull spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the six magnets in Image B, they exhibit rounded edges, which is characteristic of typical fridge magnets made from plastic or resin with a smooth finish. The surface of each magnet appears glossy, reflecting light uniformly, which indicates a polished coating. There are no visible dull spots or areas with inconsistent shine, suggesting even application of the finish. Even the flat-bottomed magnets (like the ones depicting rings) maintain a consistent gloss. This uniformity is expected in mass-produced decorative magnets, where surface quality is important for visual appeal. Therefore, based on visual evidence and knowledge of manufacturing standards for such products, the magnets display a high-quality, uniform finish.",

      "question": "Are the six magnets arranged in a non-overlapping manner, with sufficient spacing to distinguish each item clearly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The six magnets in Image B are arranged in a 3x3 grid formation on what appears to be a refrigerator door. Each magnet is positioned separately, with clear gaps between them, ensuring no overlap. The spacing allows for easy identification of individual items, whether they depict clothing, figures, or jewelry. The arrangement follows a balanced and orderly layout, typical of decorative magnet displays. From a design perspective, such spacing prevents visual clutter and enhances readability. Therefore, based on visual assessment and common practices in product display, the magnets are clearly separated and distinguishable.",
