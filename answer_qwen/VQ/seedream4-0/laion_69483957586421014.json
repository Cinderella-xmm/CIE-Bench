      "question": "Does the packaging box maintain correct proportions relative to the food processor, especially in alignment with the base and handle, without any distorted edges or warped geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging box in Image B is a three-dimensional rendering of a product box featuring an image of the Waring food processor. The proportions of the box appear consistent with standard packaging design for such appliances—rectangular, with clean edges and sharp corners. The illustration of the food processor on the front panel aligns well with the physical dimensions of the appliance, particularly in how the base, handle, and feed tube are depicted. There is no visible warping or distortion in the edges of the box itself; it maintains geometric integrity. The perspective used in the rendering suggests a slight angle to show depth, but this does not introduce any unnatural stretching or misalignment. Based on common product packaging standards and visual cues like parallel lines and consistent scaling, the proportions appear accurate.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the 'Waring' brand name clearly visible and properly aligned on the packaging without overlapping or distorting adjacent elements such as the appliance illustration or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the packaging box in Image B, the 'Waring' logo is prominently displayed in large, bold lettering on both the front and side panels. On the front, it is positioned above the image of the food processor and does not overlap with the appliance illustration. The text is cleanly rendered with proper spacing and alignment, and there is no evidence of blurring, clipping, or distortion. The font style and color contrast (black on silver/white background) ensure high visibility. On the side panel, the logo appears in white against a black background, maintaining legibility and alignment. No adjacent elements such as the exploded diagram or product image are obscured or distorted by the placement of the brand name. This follows standard branding practices where logos are placed in non-intrusive, high-visibility zones.",

      "question": "Does the isometric illustration of the food processor on the box accurately reflect the original object's geometry, including the feed tube, lid, and base, without distortion or incorrect angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The isometric illustration of the food processor on the front of the box closely matches the actual product shown in Image A. The feed tube is correctly positioned at the top center, extending vertically, and the transparent lid fits seamlessly over the bowl. The base has the same silver finish and control buttons (red, green, and blue), and the handle is accurately placed on the left side. The perspective is consistent with a standard isometric projection, preserving the spatial relationships between components. There are no signs of angular distortion, such as skewed edges or misplaced parts. Comparing with Image A, all key features—including the shape of the container, the position of the pulse button, and the overall silhouette—are preserved. This accuracy reflects professional product rendering techniques commonly used in packaging design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the exploded components of the food processor depicted with accurate shapes and positions, maintaining their original form and material texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exploded view on the side panel of the box shows several disassembled parts of the food processor, including the blade assembly, lid, and other internal components. Each part is rendered with clear outlines and appropriate proportions relative to one another. The shapes match known component designs—such as the circular blade and cylindrical shaft—indicating technical accuracy. The materials are represented with consistent textures: metallic for blades, translucent for plastic parts, and matte black for housing. There is no visible stretching, blurring, or warping in the individual components. The positioning follows logical spatial separation, typical of exploded diagrams used in product manuals. This level of detail suggests a professionally designed schematic that preserves form and function without artistic distortion.",

      "question": "Do the metallic silver and matte black surfaces of the packaging display natural material finishes without unnatural reflections, graininess, or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B features a combination of metallic silver and matte black surfaces. The silver portion has a brushed metal appearance with subtle horizontal striations, which mimics real brushed aluminum—a common aesthetic in premium kitchen appliance packaging. The reflections are soft and directional, consistent with light interaction on a matte-finished metal surface, without harsh glares or unnatural highlights. The matte black areas, particularly on the side panel, lack shine and exhibit uniform tone, suggesting a non-reflective finish. There is no visible graininess, pixelation, or texture artifacts that would indicate low-resolution rendering or poor post-processing. These visual qualities suggest high-quality digital design and printing standards, where material finishes are simulated realistically based on real-world examples.",
