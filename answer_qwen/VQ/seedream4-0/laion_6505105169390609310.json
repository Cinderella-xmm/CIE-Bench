      "question": "Are the three figurines positioned inside a transparent spherical enclosure with no visible warping or geometric distortion of their shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the three figurines are clearly visible within a transparent spherical enclosure. The shapes of the figurines appear undistorted and maintain their proportions, suggesting that there is no warping or geometric distortion caused by the enclosure. This conclusion is drawn from observing the consistent lines and edges of the figurines against the background.",

      "question": "Does the grassy hilltop beneath the figurines have a natural texture and color gradient, and are the figurines' feet properly grounded without gaps or floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grassy hilltop beneath the figurines in Image B has a natural texture with varying shades of green, simulating a realistic grass surface. The feet of the figurines rest directly on this surface without any noticeable gaps, indicating they are properly grounded. There are no floating effects observed, which supports the conclusion based on visual cues.",

      "question": "Is the golden star positioned above the central figurine, small in scale relative to the scene, and free from jagged edges or unnatural lighting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden star in Image B is positioned above the central figurine and appears small relative to the overall scene.

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes inside the globe in Image B are translucent and evenly distributed across the scene. They do not obscure the facial features or clothing details of the figurines, maintaining clarity.
