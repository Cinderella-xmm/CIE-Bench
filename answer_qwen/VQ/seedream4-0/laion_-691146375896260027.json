      "question": "Are the brown LEGO bricks covering the dresser body evenly spaced and aligned, with no visible gaps or irregularities in the surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dresser is constructed from LEGO bricks, and the brown bricks forming the main body appear to be tightly packed and uniformly arranged. The surface shows a consistent pattern of brick placement, with no obvious gaps or misalignments between pieces. The use of flat and slightly curved LEGO elements allows for a smooth approximation of the original curved shape. Given the nature of LEGO construction, some minor pixelation or step-like transitions are expected, but overall, the surface appears even and well-constructed. The alignment is consistent across the front and sides, suggesting careful assembly. Based on visual inspection and understanding of LEGO building techniques, the surface texture is largely uniform without significant irregularities.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the herringbone marquetry pattern on the front panels clearly defined and continuous, without broken lines or missing segments caused by improper LEGO piece placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The herringbone pattern on the front panels of the LEGO dresser is recreated using smaller brown LEGO bricks arranged in a zigzag fashion. While the pattern is generally recognizable and follows the classic herringbone design, the discrete nature of LEGO bricks introduces a pixelated effect. Upon close inspection, there are slight breaks and interruptions in the continuity of the lines due to the blocky nature of the medium. Some corners of the pattern appear less sharp or slightly offset compared to the smooth flow seen in real marquetry. These deviations are inherent in translating a fine wood inlay into LEGO form. Therefore, while the intent is clear, the pattern is not perfectly continuous and contains minor imperfections due to the limitations of the building material.",

      "question": "Do the gold decorative borders follow the original curved contours smoothly, without sharp angles or breaks in the flow of the design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold decorative borders on the LEGO dresser are made from gold-colored LEGO pieces, including thin tiles and slopes, designed to mimic the ornate brass mounts of the original. However, due to the modular nature of LEGO, these borders exhibit noticeable angular transitions where pieces meet. The curves are approximated using small angled bricks, but they result in a stepped appearance rather than a fluid, organic curve. In particular, the inner edges of the frame and the scrollwork show sharp corners and discontinuities that disrupt the smooth flow of the design. This contrasts with the seamless, hand-crafted metalwork of traditional furniture. Thus, despite the effort to replicate the design, the flow is interrupted by the geometric constraints of LEGO construction.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the curved side panels and cabriole legs constructed with smoothly joined sloped bricks, showing no visible steps or angular breaks in the profile?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The curved side panels and cabriole legs of the LEGO dresser utilize sloped and curved LEGO bricks to approximate the elegant curves of the original piece. While the general silhouette is accurately captured, close examination reveals subtle step-like transitions between adjacent bricks, especially along the outer edges of the curves and at the joints of the legs. These steps are a result of the discrete nature of LEGO elements, which cannot achieve the continuous curvature of wood or metal. Although the builders have used appropriate techniques (such as layered slopes), the profile still exhibits minor angular breaks, particularly near the knee and foot of the cabriole legs. Therefore, while the overall form is smooth, the surface is not entirely free of visible steps or angular interruptions.",

      "question": "Does the gray LEGO tile top sit flat and level on the dresser, with clean edges and no visible gaps or misalignments where it meets the sides?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the LEGO dresser is composed of gray LEGO tiles arranged in a grid pattern, forming a flat surface. From the image, the top appears to be level and properly aligned with the body of the dresser. The edges of the top are flush with the sides, and there are no visible gaps or overhangs. The use of standard LEGO plate connectors likely ensures structural stability and precise alignment. The transition between the top and the sides is clean, with no signs of misalignment or unevenness. This suggests that the builder has carefully matched the dimensions of the top to the base, maintaining consistency in the overall structure. Given the precision of LEGO construction and the visual evidence, the top sits flat and level with accurate edge alignment.",
