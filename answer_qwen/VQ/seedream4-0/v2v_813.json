      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dessert has been creatively transformed to resemble a sneaker.

        "Yes",
        "No"

      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the creative transformation, the core elements of the chocolate dessert—such as the cake body and the sauce—are still discernible within the sneaker design.
