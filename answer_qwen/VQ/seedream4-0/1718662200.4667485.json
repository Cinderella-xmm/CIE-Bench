      "question": "Is the head of the pig significantly larger than the body without causing visible distortions in the neck or shoulder area?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig's head appears proportionally large relative to its body, which is a common stylistic choice in cartoon and watercolor illustrations to emphasize character expressiveness. However, the neck and shoulder areas are smoothly rendered with no visible distortions or unnatural transitions. The proportions are exaggerated but consistent with the whimsical, artistic style of the image. The neck maintains a natural curvature and connects seamlessly to both the head and body, indicating that despite the larger head, there are no anatomical distortions. This aligns with common practices in stylized animal illustrations where proportions are altered for visual appeal without sacrificing structural coherence.",

      "question": "Are the green sunglasses properly rendered with consistent color and reflective properties matching the original style, without unnatural edges or texture breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green sunglasses on the pig in Image B are rendered with a consistent, vibrant green hue that matches the watercolor aesthetic of the entire image. The lenses show subtle reflections and shading that suggest transparency and depth, appropriate for sunglasses. There are no jagged edges or texture breaks; instead, the edges blend smoothly into the pig’s face, maintaining the soft, painterly quality of the artwork. The style is cohesive with the rest of the illustration, and the rendering respects the medium’s characteristics—watercolor often features soft transitions and gentle gradients, which are present here. Thus, the sunglasses are well-integrated and visually consistent with the overall art style.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the pig's hands on the turntable have five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and curvature that match typical animal anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pig’s hands are depicted with four fingers and a thumb, totaling five digits per hand, which is consistent with typical mammalian anatomy. The fingers show natural spacing and curvature, resembling those of a pig or similar animal, though stylized for artistic effect. The nails are slightly elongated, which may be an artistic exaggeration, but they do not disrupt the anatomical plausibility. The positioning of the hands on the turntable suggests functional interaction with the equipment, further reinforcing the realistic interpretation of the limbs within the cartoon context. While the illustration is not photorealistic, it adheres to general biological principles of limb structure in pigs.",

      "question": "Does the watercolor background integrate smoothly with the pig and DJ equipment, showing no abrupt edges or conflicting lighting patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watercolor background in Image B features soft, blended colors and abstract soundwave patterns that create a vibrant, musical atmosphere. The transition between the background and the pig, as well as the DJ equipment, is smooth, with no sharp or abrupt edges. The lighting is consistent across the scene, with gentle gradients and highlights that complement the pig’s form and the equipment’s metallic surfaces. The watercolor technique naturally allows for bleeding and blending, which enhances the integration of elements. There are no conflicting lighting directions or harsh shadows that would suggest a mismatch between foreground and background. The overall composition feels unified and harmonious, indicative of careful artistic planning.",

      "question": "Are the chat bubbles and surrounding soundwave patterns clearly defined, free of jagged edges, and positioned without obstructing key features like the face or turntable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chat bubbles and soundwave patterns in Image B are clearly defined with smooth, rounded edges typical of watercolor illustrations. They are rendered with clean lines and consistent opacity, avoiding jaggedness or pixelation. The placement of these elements is strategic: the main chat bubble above the pig’s head does not cover the face or eyes, preserving visibility of facial expressions. Similarly, the soundwaves are layered in the background and around the pig without overlapping critical features like the turntable or hands. The design ensures that key visual elements remain unobstructed while still contributing to the dynamic, musical theme. This thoughtful layout reflects good compositional balance and attention to visual hierarchy.",
