      "question": "Are the character's proportions in each sticker consistent with the Chibi style without any unnatural distortion or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character exhibits exaggeratedly large heads and small bodies, which is characteristic of the Chibi art style. The limbs are short and simplified, maintaining a cute and childlike appearance. There are no visible distortions or broken geometric shapes that would disrupt the consistency of the Chibi style. Each sticker adheres to these stylistic conventions.",

      "question": "Do the textures of the character's clothing and painting tools appear natural and detailed in the Chibi stickers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Chibi stickers in Image B do not exhibit highly detailed textures on the clothing or painting tools due to the nature of the Chibi style, which often simplifies details for a more cartoonish look. However, the depiction is consistent with typical Chibi illustrations where textures are minimalistic rather than realistic. Therefore, they appear natural within the context of the Chibi style.",

      "question": "Are the shapes and lines of the character's hands in the Chibi stickers natural and ergonomic, with no more than five fingers on each hand?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the character are depicted in a simplified manner typical of Chibi art. They generally have rounded shapes and smooth lines, appearing ergonomic within the style's constraints. Most stickers show hands with fewer than five fingers, which is common in Chibi art to maintain simplicity and cuteness. No hands display an unnatural number of fingers.",

      "question": "Are the colors in the Chibi stickers vibrant and consistent with the Chibi Ghibli cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are indeed vibrant, featuring bright and cheerful hues that align well with the Chibi Ghibli cartoon style. This style often employs saturated colors to create an appealing and lively visual effect. The consistency across the stickers suggests a deliberate choice to maintain this aesthetic.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the background of each Chibi sticker transparent, and are there no extraneous pieces or artifacts present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each Chibi sticker in Image B has a transparent background, as indicated by the checkered pattern typically used to denote transparency in digital images. There are no visible extraneous pieces or artifacts disrupting the clean presentation of the stickers. This ensures that the focus remains solely on the character and her activities.",
