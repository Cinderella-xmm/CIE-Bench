    "Question": "Q1: Does the crystal vase maintain the original shape and proportions of the ceramic vase, with clear faceted surfaces that follow the curvature without geometric distortion?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal vase is clearly designed to mimic the form of the original ceramic vase from Image A. The overall silhouette—including the rounded body, flared neck, ornate handles, and base—remains consistent in shape and proportion. However, the material transformation from ceramic to crystal introduces a new visual texture. The surface is composed of numerous facets, which are carefully aligned to follow the curvature of the vase. These facets appear to be precisely cut and polished, maintaining the intended contours without introducing geometric distortion such as warping or stretching. The transition from solid ceramic to transparent crystal does not compromise the structural integrity of the design; instead, it enhances the three-dimensional form through light interaction. Based on visual analysis and knowledge of crystal craftsmanship (e.g., how glassblowers and cutters preserve forms while adding clarity), the proportions and shape are preserved accurately. Therefore, the answer is yes.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the abstract floral patterns on the crystal vase etched into the surface with uniform depth and clarity, without appearing superimposed or blurred?",
    "explanation": "The crystal vase in Image B features intricate designs that resemble the painted motifs on the ceramic vase in Image A. These patterns include a central figure of a classical woman and surrounding floral elements. In the crystal version, these designs are not painted but appear to be etched or engraved into the glass. The etching is visible as subtle indentations with varying depth, creating a frosted or translucent effect. The clarity of the etching is high, with clean lines and consistent depth across the surface. There is no evidence of digital overlay or blurring that would suggest a superimposed image. Instead, the patterns integrate naturally into the crystal’s structure, with shadows and highlights indicating physical depth. This aligns with real-world techniques like acid etching or laser engraving on glass, where depth and clarity are achieved through controlled removal of material. Thus, the patterns are well-executed and not artificially layered. The answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the crystal flowers retain the recognizable shapes of the original blooms and display internal refraction and pastel coloration without appearing solid or opaque?",
    "explanation": "The flowers in Image B are rendered in crystal, mimicking the natural forms seen in Image A. Each bloom—such as daisies, poppies, and delphiniums—retains its distinct shape and structure, even though they are now transparent or semi-transparent. The internal refraction is evident: light passes through the petals, creating subtle gradients and sparkle effects typical of cut crystal. The colors are soft and pastel-like, likely due to tinted glass or internal coloring techniques used in crystal art. Importantly, the flowers are not solid or opaque; their translucency allows light to pass through, revealing inner details and giving them a delicate, luminous quality. This matches known techniques in crystal flower artistry, where artisans use colored glass or layering to achieve realism while preserving transparency. Therefore, the crystal flowers successfully emulate the original blooms with appropriate optical properties. The answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the mirrored pedestal flat and reflective, showing a clear, undistorted reflection of the crystal vase and flowers?",
    "explanation": "The pedestal beneath the crystal vase in Image B is made of a highly reflective material, likely black mirror glass or polished acrylic. It is flat and smooth, providing a clean surface for reflection. The reflection of the vase and flowers is sharp, symmetrical, and accurate, mirroring the actual object without distortion. The edges of the vase and individual petals are clearly visible in the reflection, indicating a high-quality reflective surface. There are no visible ripples, warping, or blurring that would suggest imperfections in the mirror. This reflects real-world principles of optics: a flat, polished mirror produces an undistorted image when placed horizontally under proper lighting. The reflection also includes subtle light refractions from the crystal, enhancing the realism. Hence, the pedestal functions as a perfect mirror, supporting the illusion of depth and symmetry. The answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the lighting show realistic refraction and internal glow in the crystal elements, with soft highlights and no unnatural bright spots or flat shading?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is carefully designed to simulate how light interacts with crystal. There are visible refractions within the vase and flowers, where light bends as it passes through the facets, creating prismatic effects. Internal glow is present, especially in the thicker parts of the vase and larger flower petals, suggesting illumination from within or behind the objects. Highlights are soft and diffused, following the curves of the crystal, rather than appearing harsh or over-saturated. There are no unnatural bright spots or areas of flat shading—each facet responds to light appropriately, with gradations that suggest depth and volume. This aligns with photorealistic rendering techniques used in digital art and photography, where subsurface scattering and ray tracing are employed to mimic real crystal behavior. The lighting enhances the three-dimensionality and material authenticity without artificiality. Therefore, the lighting is realistic and well-executed. The answer is yes.",
    "answer": "Yes"
