    "Question": "Q1: Are the red-and-gray train and STOP sign geometrically simplified without introducing distorted or broken shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the train and STOP sign are rendered in a minimalist, stylized manner. The train is composed of clean, straight lines and flat color blocks, with its windows, doors, and body sections represented as simplified rectangles and parallelograms. The overall form retains the recognizable silhouette of a passenger train, with no apparent distortion or fragmentation in its structure. The STOP sign is an octagon with sharp, even edges and a centered 'STOP' text, consistent with standard traffic signage design. While the proportions are slightly exaggerated for stylistic effect (e.g., the train's height appears taller than typical), the geometry remains intact and coherent. There are no broken lines, irregular angles, or warped shapes that would suggest deformation. This simplification adheres to principles of geometric abstraction without sacrificing structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the green mountain outlines and track lines look naturally integrated and consistent with the cool-toned minimalist style?",
    "explanation": "The mountains in Image B are depicted using layered, flat green triangles with subtle gradients, creating a sense of depth while maintaining simplicity. These forms align with common minimalist design practices where natural elements are abstracted into basic geometric shapes. The tracks are rendered as parallel lines with alternating light and dark gray tones, mimicking rails and sleepers in a highly stylized way. The use of soft, cool tones—light blue sky, muted greens, and grays—creates a harmonious, serene atmosphere typical of minimalist illustrations. The integration of these elements feels cohesive; there are no jarring transitions or mismatches in style. The overall aesthetic avoids realism but preserves spatial logic and visual balance, making the scene feel intentionally designed within a unified artistic framework.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Have the textures of the simplified train and STOP sign been maintained well enough to avoid loss of essential details and unnatural appearances?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both the train and the STOP sign are presented without surface textures such as metal reflections, rust, or weathering. Instead, they rely on solid colors and clean outlines. While this results in a loss of photorealistic texture, it is consistent with the minimalist art style, which prioritizes clarity and simplicity over detail. Essential features like the train’s windows, doors, and branding stripe (red band) are preserved through shape and color contrast. The STOP sign maintains its standard red octagon with white border and lettering, ensuring immediate recognition. Although textures are absent, the key identifying characteristics remain intact and legible. In minimalist design, texture is often replaced by form and color hierarchy, so the absence here does not lead to an unnatural appearance—it supports the intended aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the minimalist illustration maintain the correct spatial relationship between the train, STOP sign, and tracks without disrupting visual credibility?",
    "explanation": "Image B correctly positions the train on the tracks, with the STOP sign placed near the edge of the platform area, facing the viewer. The perspective suggests depth: the tracks converge toward the background, and the train appears to be moving along them. The relative size and placement of the objects follow logical spatial rules—the train is behind the sign, and the tracks extend from foreground to background. Despite the abstraction, the layout preserves realistic proportionality and alignment. For example, the sign is upright and at a plausible height, and the train spans multiple tracks appropriately. There is no visual conflict or misalignment that would break immersion. The minimalist approach simplifies but does not distort spatial relationships, maintaining visual credibility within the context of a stylized representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Does the cool-toned color palette remain consistent throughout the minimalist illustration, effectively supporting the traffic safety visual style?",
    "explanation": "The color scheme in Image B is dominated by cool tones: light blue sky, pale green mountains, and various shades of gray and white for the tracks and platform. These hues create a calm, orderly atmosphere. The red of the train and STOP sign stands out sharply against this backdrop, fulfilling a critical function in traffic safety design—drawing attention to important elements. Red is universally associated with stopping and caution, and its use here ensures high visibility and immediate recognition. The consistency of cool tones across non-essential areas enhances the focus on the red accents, reinforcing their significance. This selective use of warm color within a cool palette is a deliberate design choice common in safety-related graphics, balancing aesthetic harmony with functional clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
