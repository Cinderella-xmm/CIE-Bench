      "question": "Does the sail's surface retain its original fabric texture and intricate knotwork design when converted into a game board layout, without visible pixelation, warping, or inconsistent patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sail is depicted on the game box cover as part of an illustrated design rather than a physical fabric. The surface of the sail shows a stylized representation with a circular Norse knotwork pattern, which appears smooth and consistent in texture across the illustration. However, since it is a printed graphic on a box cover, it does not retain the actual tactile fabric texture or three-dimensional intricacies of the original ship’s sail seen in Image A. Instead, it mimics the appearance using digital art techniques. There is no visible pixelation or warping in the image quality; the pattern is evenly distributed and maintains consistency. But the question asks whether the 'original fabric texture' is retained — this implies a physical attribute that cannot be preserved in a 2D printed illustration. Therefore, while the design is accurate and well-rendered, the actual fabric texture is not retained.",

      "question": "Are the mini figures derived from the rowers positioned correctly along the hull, maintaining proportional size and anatomical structure without distortion or missing limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mini figures representing rowers are placed on the game board, not along the hull of the ship. These figures are separate components of the game, designed to represent Viking oarsmen. They are positioned on individual bases, each holding an oar, and appear anatomically correct with proper limbs and proportions. Their size relative to the game board tiles and other elements is consistent with typical miniature scale used in board games. There is no visible distortion, missing limbs, or unnatural scaling. In contrast, in Image A, the rowers are part of the model ship itself, integrated into the hull and uniformly sized. While both versions maintain proportional accuracy, the context differs: in Image B, they are standalone game pieces, not attached to the hull. Thus, the positioning is not 'along the hull' but rather on the game board, which satisfies the requirement of being correctly proportioned and anatomically sound, even if their placement has changed.",

      "question": "Do the Norse motifs extended onto the box cover match the original carving style and material appearance of the ship’s dragon head and hull, without jagged edges or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Norse motifs on the box cover, particularly the circular knotwork design on the side panel, are rendered in a style that closely matches the aesthetic of the dragon head and hull carvings seen on the ship model in Image A. The patterns feature interlacing lines typical of Norse art, and the color scheme uses dark brown and gold tones consistent with the wood carving. The edges of the design appear clean and smooth, without jaggedness, suggesting high-resolution rendering. The shading follows the curvature of the box surface, maintaining visual continuity with the wooden texture. While the material is now printed paper rather than carved wood, the visual replication of the style and lighting is faithful. Comparing to Image A, where the carvings are three-dimensional and have depth, the box version is a two-dimensional approximation but retains stylistic accuracy. There is no evidence of tiling or inconsistent shading, indicating careful digital design.",

      "question": "Is the typography for \"Voyage of the Vikings\" clearly legible and stylistically consistent with the historical theme, without floating above the surface or casting unrealistic shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography for 'Voyage of the Vikings' on the box cover is clearly legible, with bold, serif lettering that evokes a historical, adventurous tone appropriate for a Viking-themed board game. The font style resembles old parchment or medieval inscriptions, aligning with the thematic setting. The text is embedded within the sail illustration and appears to be part of the artwork rather than floating above the surface. It casts subtle shadows consistent with the lighting direction of the scene (coming from the candles), which enhances its integration into the image. There are no unrealistic floating effects or harsh shadow mismatches. The rendering is professional and cohesive with the overall artistic style, suggesting intentional design choices to maintain immersion. Compared to real-world packaging standards, this level of typographic integration is common and effective.",

      "question": "Do the wooden texture accents on the box sides match the grain pattern and lighting of the original wooden base and tabletop, without visible tiling or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden texture accents on the sides of the box in Image B mimic the grain pattern and warm tone of the original wooden base and tabletop seen in Image A. The vertical grain lines and natural wood coloration are consistent with the real wood surfaces, suggesting a deliberate attempt to match materials. Lighting on the box sides reflects the ambient candlelight similarly to how it illuminates the table, with soft highlights and shadows that suggest depth. There is no visible tiling — the wood pattern flows naturally without repetition artifacts — and the color gradient matches the surrounding environment. This indicates high-quality digital texturing or printing that replicates real wood effectively. When compared to Image A, the original wooden base has a polished finish with clear grain, and the box’s side texture mirrors this accurately, showing attention to detail in material consistency.",
