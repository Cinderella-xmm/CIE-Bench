      "question": "Does the chibi version of the woman have a proportionally enlarged head relative to the body, with limbs and torso scaled down appropriately without deformed joints or elongated limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is rendered in a chibi art style, which is characterized by an exaggeratedly large head relative to the body, small limbs, and a simplified, stylized form. The head is significantly larger than the torso and limbs, which is consistent with typical chibi proportions. The limbs are short and stubby, with no signs of elongation or joint deformation. The arms and legs maintain smooth, rounded forms without anatomical distortions. This stylization aligns with common practices in chibi design, where facial features are emphasized and body proportions are altered for cuteness and visual appeal. Compared to Image A, where the figure has realistic proportions, Image B clearly adopts a deliberate stylistic exaggeration that preserves structural integrity while altering scale. Thus, the head is proportionally enlarged, and the body parts are scaled down appropriately without deformation.",

      "question": "Are the oversized frills on the gown rendered with curved, layered shapes that suggest fabric volume, and do they avoid flat, rigid edges or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown in Image B features prominent, layered frills on the sleeves and hemline. These frills are depicted with rounded, overlapping curves that mimic the soft folds of fabric, suggesting volume and depth. The layers appear stacked in a natural way, resembling ruffles made from lightweight material like lace or taffeta. There are no sharp, flat edges or areas of unnatural stretching; instead, the rendering uses smooth transitions between layers to simulate draping. In comparison to Image A, where the fabric folds are more subtle and realistically shaded, Image B simplifies but still retains a sense of textile texture and dimensionality through its stylized approach. The frills are not rigid or geometrically distorted, indicating careful attention to volumetric representation within the chibi aesthetic.",

      "question": "Do the gold accents on the jewelry show consistent metallic highlights and soft shadows that align with the lighting direction in the scene, without harsh glints or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry in Image B — including the necklace, bracelets, and ring — features gold elements with visible highlights and subtle shading. The light source appears to come from the upper left, as indicated by the direction of shadows and reflections on the character’s face and clothing. The gold pieces reflect this lighting consistently, with bright specular highlights on the upper surfaces and gentle gradients into shadowed areas. There are no abrupt or overly bright glints that would suggest digital artifacting or over-sharpening. The surface of the jewelry maintains a smooth, polished appearance without pixelation or textural noise. Compared to Image A, where the gold jewelry has more subdued, painterly lighting, Image B uses digital rendering techniques to simulate realistic metallic properties while keeping them harmonious with the overall lighting scheme. The consistency of highlights and shadows supports the illusion of three-dimensional metallic objects.",

      "question": "Is the modified chair still identifiable as a chair with four legs and backrest, scaled down proportionally and colored vividly without broken geometry or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chair in Image B is clearly recognizable as a chair despite being stylized. It has a distinct backrest, armrests, seat cushion, and four legs — all present and structurally coherent. The legs are visible and proportionally reduced to match the chibi scale of the figure. The chair is rendered in vibrant colors (blue upholstery with red and orange accents), enhancing its visual appeal. There are no gaps, broken lines, or missing components; the geometry remains intact. While the design is cartoonish and exaggerated (e.g., curved armrests and bold color blocking), it retains the essential functional form of a chair. In contrast to Image A, where the chair is more realistically depicted with muted tones and subtle textures, Image B transforms it into a playful, stylized object suitable for the chibi theme. However, the core structure is preserved and accurately represented.",

      "question": "Does the pearl border surround the image edge evenly, with uniformly sized spheres and consistent spacing, without overlapping the subject or showing jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border in Image B consists of a frame made of white spherical pearls arranged in a continuous loop around the entire perimeter. Each pearl appears to be of uniform size and spacing, creating a symmetrical and decorative frame. The pearls are aligned neatly along the edge, forming a clean boundary that does not intrude into the main image or overlap with the character or background elements. There are no visible jagged edges, irregularities, or gaps in the pattern, suggesting high-quality digital rendering. The border enhances the composition without distorting any part of the scene. Compared to Image A, which lacks any such frame, Image B introduces this ornamental element as a stylistic choice, and it is executed with precision and consistency. The evenness and clarity of the pearl arrangement indicate careful design work.",
