    "Question": "Q1: Are the limbs of the astronaut proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they avoid unnatural bends or distortions in the joints when enlarged with zig-zag motion lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut's limbs are depicted in a dynamic pose with one arm raised in a fist and the other resting by the side. The joints—particularly at the elbows and knees—are rendered with smooth curvature and appropriate flexion angles that align with typical human anatomical movement. The addition of zig-zag motion lines near the arms suggests speed or force but does not interfere with the limb proportions or joint structure. These motion lines are stylized and placed externally, not distorting the underlying form. The limbs appear to maintain realistic musculature and articulation, even under exaggeration for dramatic effect. While the art style is illustrative and cartoonish, the proportions remain within plausible human anatomy. There is no visible overextension or unnatural bending of joints, such as hyperflexion or dislocation, which would suggest distortion. Thus, despite the stylization, the limbs retain anatomical consistency.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the celestial motifs applied to the suit exhibit uniform texture and shading that aligns with the material appearance of the spacesuit, without visible seams or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The spacesuit in Image B features decorative celestial motifs—such as stars and blue gradients—applied primarily on the legs and lower torso. These patterns are integrated into the suit’s surface using a semi-transparent overlay technique that mimics a painted or printed design rather than a physical texture. However, upon close inspection, the transitions between the metallic silver base of the suit and the blue starry patterns show inconsistent shading. The lighting appears flat in some areas, especially where the blue elements meet the silver, lacking depth or reflection continuity. Additionally, there are subtle edges around the motifs that resemble digital layering artifacts, suggesting a lack of seamless integration. The textures do not convincingly mimic real fabric or composite materials used in actual spacesuits. Therefore, while the design is visually appealing, it fails to achieve uniformity in texture and shading, and minor seams or digital artifacts are present.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the illustrated moon surface positioned at the correct depth and scale relative to the astronaut’s feet and shadow, with no visible gaps or misalignment between the figure and ground?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut stands atop a small, rounded representation of the lunar surface, which appears beneath the feet. The positioning of the feet is aligned with the curved edge of the moon depiction, and the shadow extends naturally from the figure toward the bottom left, suggesting a light source from above and behind. There is no visible gap between the astronaut’s boots and the moon surface; the contact point is continuous and logically placed. The scale of the moon fragment is exaggerated for artistic effect, but it maintains a coherent spatial relationship with the figure. The perspective is consistent with a low-angle view, and the shadow supports this depth cue. Although the moon is stylized and not geographically accurate, its placement relative to the astronaut’s stance and shadow is consistent and free of misalignment. No floating or disconnected elements are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the astronaut’s face retain natural facial proportions and feature alignment, such as symmetrical eyes and a defined jawline, without excessive smoothing or distortion?",
    "explanation": "The astronaut’s face in Image B is rendered with clear symmetry: both eyes are evenly spaced, aligned horizontally, and have similar shape and size. The nose is centered, and the jawline is well-defined with a natural curve, consistent with human facial anatomy. There is no visible distortion such as elongation, asymmetry, or exaggerated features. The skin texture appears slightly smoothed, which is common in stylized illustrations, but not to the extent of losing realism. The facial expression is neutral and balanced, with subtle shading that enhances depth without altering proportions. Compared to typical portrait standards, the face retains natural proportions and avoids artificial smoothing that might suggest digital overprocessing. Therefore, the facial features are proportionally accurate and aesthetically consistent with human anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the space-themed border evenly aligned around the image edge without overlapping or cutting into the astronaut or background elements, and does the simulated card stock texture appear uniform and free of repetition?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a dark blue border adorned with white stars, framing the central illustration. This border is uniformly aligned along all four edges, maintaining consistent width and spacing. It does not overlap or intrude into the astronaut or the inner white background, preserving clean separation between the frame and the subject. The border also includes a subtle inner margin that prevents any clipping of the astronaut’s limbs or the moon surface. Regarding the simulated card stock texture, it appears as a fine grain across the white background, giving the impression of paper. This texture is evenly distributed and does not show obvious repeating patterns or tiling artifacts. While slight variations in tone suggest a hand-drawn or textured effect, they are consistent with the intended aesthetic and do not detract from visual coherence. Thus, both the border alignment and the texture simulation are well-executed and free of flaws.",
    "answer": "Yes"
