      "question": "Do the muscles and body proportions of the basketball player appear exaggerated but still maintain anatomical plausibility without unnatural bulges or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the basketball player is rendered in a stylized, animated art style. The musculature is clearly emphasized, with defined biceps, triceps, and leg muscles that are larger than typical human proportions—common in cartoon or anime-inspired character design. However, despite this exaggeration, the muscle groups follow recognizable anatomical patterns (e.g., deltoids, quads, calves), and there are no visible distortions such as bulges, disconnected limbs, or incorrect joint angles. The overall silhouette remains proportionate and balanced, maintaining a sense of physical coherence even within the stylized framework. This aligns with common practices in animation where characters are exaggerated for visual impact while preserving basic biomechanical logic. Compared to a realistic depiction (as seen in Image A), the stylization is intentional and consistent with artistic conventions.",

      "question": "Are the colors applied to the player's clothing and skin consistent with the graffiti theme and do they retain visible texture and material properties without appearing flat or artificially oversaturated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B are vibrant and bold, matching the energetic graffiti background which features neon pinks, purples, blues, and yellows. The player’s blue jersey and shorts harmonize with these hues, contributing to a cohesive urban aesthetic. The skin tone is rendered with gradient shading and subtle highlights, suggesting form and depth rather than flatness. Additionally, the clothing has visible texture cues—such as fabric folds and light interaction—implying material properties like cotton or spandex. While the saturation is higher than in real life, it is appropriate for an animated, stylized image and does not appear unnaturally oversaturated or washed out. In contrast to Image A, which uses more naturalistic tones, Image B embraces a hyper-stylized palette that enhances the graffiti theme without sacrificing visual credibility.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the basketball have exactly five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does it grip the ball in a physically credible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B displays five distinct fingers, each with proper curvature and spacing. The thumb is positioned on one side of the basketball, and the other fingers wrap around it in a way that mimics a standard dribble grip. The positioning allows for realistic contact points between the fingers and the ball, suggesting control and balance. There are no missing digits or malformed joints. While the hand is slightly stylized—consistent with the overall animation style—the anatomy remains plausible and functional. Comparing to Image A, the hand in the original photo appears more lifelike, but both versions depict a credible grip. The stylized version maintains the essential mechanics of a basketball hold, so it remains physically believable within its artistic context.",

      "question": "Is the blank graffiti-style text area clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the background graffiti, and placed in a way that does not distort the scene or obscure key elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A large white rectangular area is present in Image B, located near the player’s right side and extending toward the background. It appears to be a placeholder for text, possibly intended for branding or customization. The rectangle itself lacks any graffiti styling and stands out due to its stark white color against the colorful backdrop. Its edges are clean and sharp, contrasting with the organic, flowing lines of the surrounding graffiti. While it does not obscure the player or the basketball hoop directly, it intrudes into the composition and disrupts the visual continuity of the wall art. Furthermore, it lacks stylistic consistency—it doesn’t mimic the graffiti font, layering, or spray-paint effect seen elsewhere. Therefore, although it is clearly visible, it fails to integrate seamlessly with the environment and breaks the thematic cohesion of the scene.",

      "question": "Are the lighting, shadows, and surface textures of the player, basketball, and court consistent with each other and free from artifacts such as mismatched highlights or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears directional, likely simulating overhead sunlight, casting soft shadows beneath the player and the basketball. The highlights on the player’s skin, jersey, and shoes are consistent with this light source, showing specular reflections that suggest a smooth surface. The basketball has a glossy finish with a clear highlight on the top-right, matching the direction of illumination. The court surface reflects light uniformly, with subtle texture indicating a rubberized material. There are no obvious artifacts like ghosting, double outlines, or misaligned shadows. However, some edges around the figure have a glowing outline effect (common in cel-shaded animation), which, while stylistic, could be interpreted as a form of digital artifact if not intended. But given the artistic style, this glow is purposeful and enhances depth. Compared to Image A, which has softer, more natural lighting, Image B uses dramatic contrasts and stylized rendering, yet maintains internal consistency across elements. Thus, within the context of the art style, lighting and textures are coherent.",
