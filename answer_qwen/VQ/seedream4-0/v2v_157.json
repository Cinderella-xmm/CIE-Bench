      "question": "Do the books and diploma held by the owl appear to integrate seamlessly with the owl's body without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the owl is perched atop a stack of three books, and it holds a rolled diploma tied with a yellow ribbon. The books are rendered with consistent color gradients and visible spine details, suggesting a realistic texture. The owl's feet rest naturally on the top book, and there are no visible seams or distortions at the contact points between the owl’s claws and the book cover. The diploma is held in the owl’s talon, and its cylindrical shape aligns well with the grip, showing no clipping or unnatural warping. The lighting appears consistent across the objects, and shadows are soft and plausible, indicating that the integration of these elements into the scene is coherent. There are no obvious digital artifacts such as jagged edges or texture mismatches. Based on visual analysis and common sense about object integration in digital art, the books and diploma appear to be seamlessly incorporated.",

      "question": "Does the graduation cap on the owl's head maintain the structural integrity of the owl's head, avoiding any distortion or unnatural geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The graduation cap on the owl in Image B is positioned directly on the head, with the tassel hanging to the left side. The cap maintains a typical square academic shape with clean edges and a consistent perspective relative to the owl’s head. The owl’s facial features—such as the eyes, beak, and ear tufts—are not compressed or distorted by the presence of the cap. The cap appears to sit naturally on the head without altering the underlying anatomy or creating unnatural bulges or flattening. This suggests that the cap has been digitally added with attention to proportion and spatial harmony. From a world knowledge standpoint, academic caps are typically designed to sit flat on the head without deforming it, and this image adheres to that expectation. Therefore, the structural integrity of the owl’s head is preserved.",

      "question": "Are the owl's feathers and eyes free from any loss of detail or unnatural textures, preserving their original quality and appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The owl in Image B displays detailed feather patterns with varied shades of brown, tan, and white, creating a textured, lifelike appearance. Each feather is individually rendered with fine lines and shading, contributing to a natural look. The eyes are large, round, and vividly colored with orange irises and black pupils, featuring subtle highlights that suggest depth and reflectivity. These details are consistent with high-quality digital illustration standards. There is no evidence of pixelation, blurring, or texture repetition that would indicate degradation. Furthermore, the feathers around the face and wings retain clarity even near the added elements like the cap and diploma. Given that the owl was likely originally illustrated with care, and the editing process did not introduce artifacts, the quality of the feathers and eyes remains intact.",

      "question": "Does the lighting in the image enhance the details of the owl and the added elements without creating any unnatural shadows or highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to come from a consistent direction, likely from the upper left, casting soft shadows on the right side of the owl, the books, and the glass case. The highlights on the owl’s feathers, the glossy surface of the glass case, and the reflective base are appropriately placed and contribute to a sense of depth. The diploma and ribbon also have gentle highlights that match the light source. There are no harsh glares, overexposed areas, or shadow inconsistencies that would suggest poor lighting design. The reflections on the glass case are subtle and realistic, enhancing the perception of transparency without distorting the objects inside. Overall, the lighting supports the realism of the scene and does not introduce unnatural effects.",

      "question": "Are the books beneath the owl free from any unnatural textures or distortions, maintaining a realistic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stack of books under the owl in Image B consists of three volumes with distinct colors (blue, orange, and red), each displaying realistic spine grooves, page edges, and slight wear along the corners. The textures of the book covers are smooth and consistent, with no signs of stretching, warping, or pixelation. The alignment of the books is stable, and they appear to support the owl’s weight plausibly. The shadows cast by the books are soft and follow the light direction, reinforcing their three-dimensional form. There is no visible artifacting or misalignment that would suggest digital manipulation errors. From a world knowledge perspective, books in illustrations are often depicted with attention to material properties, and these books meet that standard. Thus, they maintain a realistic appearance.",
