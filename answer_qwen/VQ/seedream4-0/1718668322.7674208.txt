    "Question": "Q1: Do the shoulder and chest armor sections display realistic metallic sheen with proper light reflection and depth, avoiding flat or overly shiny surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the shoulder and chest armor sections exhibit a reflective metallic surface that captures light realistically. The reflections are not overly bright but have enough variation to suggest depth and texture. This is consistent with how polished metal would behave under lighting conditions. There are no flat areas that lack detail, which supports the conclusion that the metallic sheen is well-rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the joint areas of the armor aligned with the underlying anatomy and free from geometric distortions or unnatural gaps?",
    "explanation": "The joints in the armor appear to align logically with human anatomy, such as at the elbows and knees. There are no visible geometric distortions or unnatural gaps that would disrupt the flow of movement implied by the pose. The design suggests flexibility while maintaining structural integrity, which is typical for advanced armor designs in science fiction contexts.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Do the metallic hair strands appear as continuous, flowing wires with consistent color gradients and reflective properties, without breaking or clumping unnaturally?",
    "explanation": "The metallic hair strands in Image B are depicted as continuous and flowing, with smooth transitions between colors. They reflect light consistently along their length, suggesting a uniform material property. There are no breaks or unnatural clumps, which enhances the realism of the wire-like appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the background a uniform, neutral gray tone with no visible remnants of the original setting or inconsistent lighting?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is a consistent, neutral gray tone. There are no elements that resemble the original setting or inconsistencies in lighting that would detract from the uniformity. This indicates a clean edit where the subject has been effectively isolated against the new background.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are all edited regions—armor, hair, and background—seamlessly integrated with smooth transitions and no visible artifacts like pixelation or mismatched edges?",
    "explanation": "The integration of the armor, hair, and background in Image B appears seamless. The transitions between these elements are smooth, and there are no visible pixelations or mismatched edges that would indicate poor editing. The overall quality suggests careful attention to detail in the editing process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
