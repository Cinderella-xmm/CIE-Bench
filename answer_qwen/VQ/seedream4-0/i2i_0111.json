      "question": "Does the edited image retain authentic swirl patterns and color transitions in the night sky, maintaining its style and materials without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the night sky retains the iconic swirling patterns characteristic of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night,' with visible brushstroke-like textures that mimic the original painting’s impasto technique. The color transitions from deep blues to vibrant yellows and greens are preserved, especially around the stars and moon, which maintain their radiant halos. However, due to the application as a wall sticker or projection in a bedroom setting, there is a noticeable shift in luminosity—particularly the glow-in-the-dark effect—which enhances certain areas (like stars and the crescent moon) with a neon greenish tint. While this glow adds an artificial luminescence not present in the original, it does not distort the overall swirls or disrupt the directional flow of the sky. The texture appears consistent with the artistic style, though slightly smoother than the original canvas texture. Given that the visual intent is to reproduce the painting in a decorative context, the authenticity of the swirls and color transitions is largely maintained despite the added glow effect.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and alignment of key elements such as the cypress tree and the village preserved correctly in the bedroom scene, ensuring structural consistency and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cypress tree remains a dominant vertical element on the left side of the composition, mirroring its position in the original painting. Its height relative to the surrounding landscape and the village below appears proportionally accurate. The village, including the church steeple, is situated in the lower right quadrant, consistent with the original layout. However, due to the scale of the wall mural and the curvature of the wall surface, there may be slight foreshortening or distortion at the edges, particularly near the corners of the wall. Despite this, the core spatial relationships—such as the cypress towering over the village and the steeple rising above the rooftops—are preserved. The alignment of these elements maintains visual credibility within the context of a room decoration, where perfect geometric precision is less critical than aesthetic fidelity. Therefore, while minor distortions may exist due to physical constraints, the overall proportions and alignment remain faithful.",

      "question": "Do the church steeple and stars maintain their crisp details and natural appearance in the wall sticker, avoiding unnatural distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The church steeple in Image B is clearly visible and retains its slender, pointed form, consistent with the original painting. However, due to the lighting conditions and the glow-in-the-dark effect, some fine details like the cross at the top appear slightly blurred or diffused, likely because of the emission of light from the surface. Similarly, the stars exhibit a glowing halo effect that enhances their visibility but also softens their sharpness. In the original painting, the stars have defined circular centers with radiating lines, but in Image B, the glow causes them to appear more diffuse, especially under ambient room lighting. This results in a loss of some fine textural details. Additionally, the edges of the stars and the steeple show slight blurring, possibly due to the material of the wall sticker or the method of application. While the overall shapes are recognizable, the crispness is reduced compared to the original.",

      "question": "Do the colors used for the glow-in-the-dark effect create a natural and visually plausible appearance, harmonizing well with the bedroom environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glow-in-the-dark effect in Image B introduces a bright, neon-green hue to the stars, moon, and parts of the sky, which contrasts with the original painting’s warm yellow and blue tones. While this effect enhances visibility in low-light conditions, it deviates significantly from the natural color palette of Van Gogh’s work. The glowing elements stand out too vividly against the darker background, creating a surreal rather than realistic atmosphere. In the context of a bedroom, this can be aesthetically pleasing for ambiance, but it lacks visual plausibility when compared to the original artwork. The glow does not mimic natural starlight or moonlight; instead, it resembles artificial neon lighting. Thus, while harmonious in a decorative sense, the effect is not naturally plausible in terms of color accuracy or realism.",

      "question": "Are the shapes and forms of elements like the clouds and moon preserved accurately in the edited image, avoiding any damage or unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moon in Image B maintains its crescent shape and position in the upper right corner, consistent with the original painting. The swirling cloud formations are also present, following the same dynamic, vortex-like patterns seen in the original. However, the glow-in-the-dark effect causes the edges of the moon and clouds to appear slightly blurred or softened, particularly where the light emits from the surface. This could be due to the nature of phosphorescent materials or the way light interacts with the wall texture. Additionally, the overall brightness of the glowing areas might cause the adjacent regions to appear washed out, affecting the perception of depth and form. While the fundamental shapes are preserved, the subtle distortions caused by the illumination reduce the accuracy of the forms. Nevertheless, no major structural damage or warping is evident—the shapes remain recognizable and stylistically consistent.",
