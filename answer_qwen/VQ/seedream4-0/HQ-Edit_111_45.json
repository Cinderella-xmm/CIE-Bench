      "question": "Is the golden halo around the blacksmith’s head smoothly rendered with even luminosity and no jagged edges or visible seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden halo surrounding the central figure in Image B is a prominent visual element, designed to convey divinity or sanctity. Observing its appearance, the halo has a consistent golden glow with smooth curvature and no visible pixelation or jagged edges. The luminosity appears evenly distributed across the circular shape, with subtle radial gradients that enhance its ethereal quality without introducing harsh contrasts or seams. This smooth rendering aligns with traditional religious iconography, where halos are depicted as seamless, radiant rings. There are no breaks or irregularities in the outline, suggesting high-quality digital rendering. Based on visual inspection and common standards for sacred imagery, the halo is well-integrated and polished.",

      "question": "Do the flowing robes on the central figure show natural fabric folds and consistent material texture without unnatural stretching or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The robes worn by the central figure in Image B are elaborate, draped in a manner reminiscent of classical religious art. The fabric exhibits a series of soft, cascading folds that follow the contours of the body, particularly around the arms and lower torso. These folds appear physically plausible, with shadows and highlights indicating volume and depth. The texture of the fabric seems consistent—likely a heavy silk or linen—with slight sheen and fine detailing that suggests weave patterns. There are no areas of unnatural stretching, such as exaggerated elongation or pinching, nor are there visible gaps where the fabric should be continuous. The way the robe drapes over the arm and flows to the ground maintains anatomical plausibility and textile behavior under gravity. Compared to typical artistic representations of holy figures (e.g., in Renaissance paintings), this rendering adheres closely to realistic cloth dynamics.",

      "question": "Are the divine instruments held by the blacksmith clearly derived from the original hammer and tongs, with preserved proportions and no geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tools held by the central figure—a hammer and tongs—are central to the blacksmith motif. In Image B, these instruments retain their basic forms but appear slightly stylized, possibly to emphasize their symbolic or divine nature. The hammer has a balanced head-to-handle ratio, and the tongs maintain symmetrical jaws and a straight shaft. There are no apparent geometric distortions such as warped angles, disproportionate scaling, or broken symmetry. While the lighting enhances their metallic shine and gives them a glowing aura, their core shapes remain faithful to functional blacksmith tools. The transformation into 'divine instruments' does not compromise their structural integrity; instead, it elevates them through visual embellishment rather than deformation. Thus, they are recognizable derivatives of real-world tools with preserved proportions.",

      "question": "Does the glowing interior of the forge emit consistent radiant light without excessive bloom, pixelation, or irregular ember patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forge in Image B emits a bright, warm glow that radiates outward from the firebox. The light appears consistent in intensity and direction, casting appropriate illumination on nearby surfaces like the anvil and stone walls. The embers inside the forge are rendered with a granular yet cohesive pattern, resembling real coal and flame activity. There is no visible pixelation or aliasing in the glow, and the bloom effect—where light spills beyond its source—is controlled and natural-looking, contributing to atmospheric depth without overwhelming the scene. The fire's color gradient transitions smoothly from deep orange to yellow at the center, which is realistic for a high-temperature forge. No irregular or artificial ember clusters suggest poor rendering. Overall, the light emission is both visually convincing and technically sound.",

      "question": "Are the vine borders and calligraphy evenly distributed along the image edges without overlapping or obscuring the main subject or tools?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features ornate decorative elements including vine borders and Gothic-style calligraphy framing the central scene. These elements are confined to the outer margins of the image, following a symmetrical layout that complements the central composition. The vines grow vertically along the left and right sides and horizontally along the top and bottom, forming a cohesive border. Importantly, they do not intrude into the main action—neither the blacksmith nor the anvil, hammer, or forge are obscured. The calligraphy, while elaborate, is placed within the frame so that it does not interfere with the visibility of key objects. The spacing between the text and the image is sufficient to preserve clarity. This design choice reflects traditional illuminated manuscript aesthetics, where decoration enhances rather than distracts from the central narrative. Therefore, the borders are well-placed and non-intrusive.",

      "question": "Do both hands of the blacksmith display anatomically correct five-fingered grips with natural joint alignment and no deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the blacksmith holds both the hammer and tongs with his hands positioned in a working grip. Upon close inspection, both hands exhibit five distinct fingers, with proper articulation at the knuckles and joints. The fingers wrap around the tool handles in a natural, biomechanically plausible manner—no missing digits, fused fingers, or unnatural bending are present. The thumbs are correctly aligned opposite the other fingers, allowing for a secure grip. The lighting accentuates the hand contours, revealing subtle shading that supports the three-dimensional form. While the hands are stylized slightly to match the overall artistic tone, they remain anatomically accurate and free from deformation. This level of detail suggests careful attention to human anatomy in digital modeling.",
