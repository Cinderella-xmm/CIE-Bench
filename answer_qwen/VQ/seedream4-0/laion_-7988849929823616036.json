      "question": "Does the floral pattern on the suit jacket follow the contours of the lapels and shoulders without visible distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral pattern on the suit jacket appears to follow the contours of the lapels and shoulders smoothly. The flowers and geometric shapes are aligned in a way that suggests they were carefully placed to match the natural lines of the clothing. There is no visible distortion or misalignment that would indicate poor editing. The visual cues suggest a high level of attention to detail in the design process.",

      "question": "Is the geometric design on the bow tie aligned symmetrically and properly tied under the collar without breaking the knot shape or introducing sharp, artificial edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric design on the bow tie in Image B is symmetrical and properly tied under the collar. The edges of the bow tie are clean and do not introduce any sharp, artificial edges that would disrupt the knot shape. The alignment with the collar indicates careful placement and consideration for maintaining the integrity of the original image's structure.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dotted texture in the background of Image B is evenly spaced and consistent in size and density throughout. There are no areas where the dots overlap or obscure the subject, which suggests a deliberate choice to keep the background simple and unobtrusive. This consistency contributes to a clean and professional look.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, appear proportionally correct and undistorted. The skin texture and shading seem natural, suggesting that the editing process maintained the original quality of the face. Comparing this with Image A, the facial features retain their original proportions and details without any noticeable alterations.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral suit and graphic bow tie in Image B exhibit consistent lighting and shadowing relative to the shirt and background. There are no unnatural highlights or flat areas that would suggest inconsistent lighting. The shadows and highlights on the suit and bow tie align well with the overall lighting of the image, indicating a cohesive and well-executed edit.",
