      "question": "Does the kimono feature bold, clean outlines and uniformly flat color regions without gradient blending or photographic texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono is rendered with distinct, sharp black outlines that define its shape and floral patterns. The colors within the kimono are applied in flat, uniform regions—such as the red base and the multicolored floral motifs—without visible gradients or shading that would suggest depth or photographic realism. This style aligns closely with traditional Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e), where color fields are typically flat and separated by strong outlines. There is no evidence of smooth transitions or textured surfaces that would indicate photorealism. Instead, the visual language emphasizes clarity and stylization over naturalistic rendering. Thus, the kimono adheres to the aesthetic of flat, outlined forms typical of such artistic traditions.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossoms represented with simplified, stylized shapes and muted pink hues, avoiding photorealistic detail or irregular clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossoms in Image B are depicted using simplified, almost schematic clusters of flowers. Each bloom is composed of a few rounded petals grouped together, lacking fine botanical details like stamens or individual petal textures. The color palette uses soft, muted pinks and light peach tones, consistent with the subdued chromatic range often seen in ukiyo-e prints. These blossoms do not exhibit the dense, irregular clumping or complex layering found in photorealistic depictions. Instead, they are arranged in orderly, stylized patterns along the branches, emphasizing design over realism. This approach reflects traditional Japanese artistic conventions that prioritize harmony and symbolic representation over literal accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the path stones and vertical poles display textured patterns such as hatching, stippling, or woodgrain that align with traditional woodblock printing techniques?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the stone path and the vertical wooden poles show clear textural elements characteristic of woodblock printing. The stones have crosshatch patterns and subtle linear markings suggesting carved or weathered surfaces, while the poles are detailed with vertical lines mimicking wood grain. These techniques—hatching and line work—are hallmarks of traditional ukiyo-e printing, where texture is created through carving into woodblocks rather than digital rendering. The absence of smooth, uniform surfaces further supports this interpretation. These stylistic choices are deliberate and consistent with historical printmaking methods, reinforcing the image’s alignment with classical Japanese art forms.",

      "question": "Is the figure's body proportionate and structurally sound, with no exaggerated limbs, distorted joints, or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits balanced proportions typical of idealized human forms in traditional Japanese art. The posture is upright and graceful, with arms and legs positioned naturally for walking. The limbs are neither elongated nor shortened in an unrealistic manner, and the joints (such as elbows and knees) appear anatomically correct. The silhouette maintains symmetry and fluidity, consistent with classical depictions of women in ukiyo-e prints. While stylization may slightly alter realism, there is no indication of distortion or unnatural curvature. The overall structure supports a sense of elegance and physical coherence, adhering to both artistic convention and basic anatomical plausibility.",

      "question": "Are the distant hills depicted as simplified, layered forms with flat colors and clear outlines, consistent with traditional ukiyo-e landscape conventions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background hills are rendered in a highly stylized manner. They are composed of simple, overlapping layers with clear, defined edges and flat color application—using shades of beige and grayish-blue—without gradients or atmospheric perspective. This technique mirrors the conventional way landscapes were portrayed in ukiyo-e, where depth was suggested through layering and color contrast rather than realistic shading or texture. The lack of detailed topography or vegetation further emphasizes abstraction and simplification. This approach aligns perfectly with the aesthetic principles of traditional Japanese woodblock prints, which favor compositional balance and symbolic representation over naturalistic depiction.",
