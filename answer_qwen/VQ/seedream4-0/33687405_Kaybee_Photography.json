      "question": "Are the patterns and beadwork on the woman's blue vest clearly defined and consistent with the original image's details, without blurred edges or unnatural pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the patterns and beadwork on the woman's blue vest are clearly visible with distinct edges and consistent colors. The details appear sharp and there is no noticeable pixelation or blurring that would suggest a loss of quality. The analysis is based on observing the clarity and definition of the intricate designs against the fabric's texture.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the stat bars positioned in a way that does not obscure key facial features or clothing details and appear visually coherent with the overall composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stat bars in Image B are placed below the central figure and do not overlap with any key facial features or clothing details. They are visually coherent as they align well with the overall design and do not disrupt the composition. This conclusion is drawn from assessing their position relative to the subject and ensuring they do not interfere with important visual elements.",

      "question": "Does the woven-texture title banner at the top have consistent thread-like patterns and natural shading, without visible warping or repeating artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woven-texture title banner at the top of Image B displays consistent thread-like patterns with natural shading. There are no visible warping or repeating artifacts that would indicate poor rendering. The analysis involves examining the uniformity and continuity of the texture across the banner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the gold-etched nameplate free from exaggerated glares or inconsistent surface reflections, and does it maintain a uniform thickness and edge definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold-etched nameplate in Image B appears free from exaggerated glares or inconsistent surface reflections. It maintains a uniform thickness and edge definition, contributing to its realistic appearance. This assessment is based on checking for smoothness and consistency in the material's depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the geometric tribal motifs along the border continuous, symmetrical, and free from gaps or distorted angles that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric tribal motifs along the border in Image B are continuous and symmetrical, with no gaps or distorted angles. The motifs form a seamless pattern around the image, indicating high-quality rendering. The evaluation considers the symmetry and alignment of the motifs to ensure they are well-rendered.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the abstracted trees and gathering figures in the background maintain logical spatial relationships and soft transitions, without abrupt edges or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abstracted trees and gathering figures in the background of Image B maintain logical spatial relationships and soft transitions. There are no abrupt edges or misplaced elements that would disrupt the scene's coherence. This conclusion is reached by analyzing the harmony and flow of the background elements within the overall composition.",
