      "question": "Does the transformed book maintain consistent proportions and structural integrity when opened into a pop-up form, without warped edges or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the book is depicted as an open, three-dimensional pop-up structure with figures standing on its pages. The proportions appear consistent with the original book's size, and the structural integrity seems maintained as the figures are firmly placed on the pages without any visible warping or floating. This conclusion is drawn by observing the alignment of the figures with the book's pages and the absence of visual distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the quill positioned centrally and vertically as a stable pivot, with natural feather texture and metallic base that match the original materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill in Image B is indeed positioned centrally and vertically within the pop-up book structure, serving as a pivot for the figures. Its feather texture appears natural, and the metallic base matches the material seen in Image A. Comparing it to Image A, where the quill is also present but not part of the book, the consistency in design and material suggests a logical transformation.",

      "question": "Does the inkwellâ€™s transformation into a fountain include realistic water flow and surface reflections without unnatural highlights or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inkwell in Image B does not show any transformation into a fountain; it remains a static object with no indication of water flow or surface reflections. Therefore, there is no basis for assessing realism in terms of water dynamics. Based on this observation, the question's premise does not apply.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the glass cloche transparent and free of distortion, with smooth curvature and accurate light refraction across all internal elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cloche in Image B is transparent and exhibits smooth curvature. Light refraction is accurately depicted, as evidenced by the clear visibility of the objects inside and the subtle distortions caused by the curvature of the glass. These observations align with common properties of glass cloches, confirming their transparency and optical accuracy.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the engraved lines on the wooden base continuous, legible, and integrated with the wood texture without sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B features engraved lines that appear continuous and legible. They are well-integrated with the wood texture, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural depth variations. This assessment is based on the visual coherence between the engravings and the wood grain, which suggests a harmonious design.",
