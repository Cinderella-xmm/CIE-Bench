      "question": "Are the eyes and mouth of the horse in both panels correctly positioned and proportionally consistent with the original plush design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the top panel shows a stylized cartoon version of the rocking horse. The eyes are large, round, and positioned high on the head, which is typical for animated characters but differs from the more realistic proportions seen in plush toys. The mouth is drawn with a wide, smiling expression that appears exaggerated compared to the subtle smile on the original plush. In the bottom panel, the horse's face is more faithful to the original design—eyes are smaller and closer to the actual placement on the plush, and the mouth has a gentle curve matching the original. However, the overall facial features still appear slightly simplified due to cartoon styling. Comparing this to Image A (the original plush), the real horse has a more natural eye shape and a less pronounced mouth. While the bottom panel retains reasonable proportions, the top panel exaggerates facial features for animation effect. Therefore, while some consistency exists, especially in the bottom panel, the top panel deviates significantly in proportion.",

      "question": "Is the lasso above the horse's head shaped naturally and positioned so that it appears to be twirling in mid-air without intersecting or clipping through the horse's body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bottom panel of Image B, a lasso is depicted above the horse’s head, forming a circular loop as if in motion. The rope forms a smooth, continuous arc with no visible breaks or distortions, suggesting a dynamic spinning motion. It is positioned clearly above the horse’s head and does not touch or intersect any part of the horse’s body, including its ears or mane. This spatial separation indicates careful placement to simulate a realistic aerial toss. From a physics perspective, a lasso thrown in such a manner would follow a parabolic trajectory, and the depiction here aligns well with that expectation. There are no visual artifacts indicating clipping or intersection, and the shadow under the lasso further enhances the sense of depth and separation. Thus, the lasso appears naturally shaped and properly positioned.",

      "question": "Do the cacti and wooden saloon buildings in the background align with the horizon line and cast shadows consistent with the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, the background depicts a classic Western town setting with cacti and wooden saloon-style buildings. The horizon line is clearly defined and runs horizontally across both scenes. The cacti and buildings are placed along this line, maintaining proper alignment. Shadows are cast toward the lower left side of the image, suggesting that the light source (likely the sun) is coming from the upper right. This directional lighting is consistent across all elements: the shadows beneath the cacti, the building overhangs, and even the rocking horse itself (in the bottom panel) show shading on the left side, reinforcing the same light direction. Additionally, the length and angle of the shadows suggest a midday or early afternoon sun, which is plausible for a desert environment. No inconsistencies in shadow direction or horizon alignment are observed.",

      "question": "Are the fur texture of the horse and the plastic details of the rocking base clearly visible and not blurred or oversimplified due to stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, particularly in the bottom panel, the horse's fur is rendered with soft, fluffy strokes that mimic the plush material seen in Image A. While it is stylized, the texture is still distinguishable as furry rather than flat or smooth. The white patches on the muzzle and chest are clearly defined, and the brown areas have subtle shading to suggest depth. The rocking base, made of plastic in the original, is depicted with clear outlines and segmented parts, including the wheels and rockers. Although simplified for cartoon style, the structural details like bolts and the 'Rockin' Rider' label are visible and legible. In contrast to the top panel, where the horse appears flatter and less detailed, the bottom panel preserves most of the key textures and mechanical components. Overall, despite stylization, essential visual information about material and structure remains intact.",

      "question": "Is the text “Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!” positioned at the top of the image without overlapping any part of the horse or background elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Wild, Wild Horse Adventures!' is located at the very top of Image B, centered above both panels. It is set against a solid blue sky background and does not overlap with any part of the horse, cacti, or buildings below. The font is bold and outlined, ensuring readability, and it is spaced far enough from the top edge of the first panel to avoid interference. The text is fully contained within the upper margin, leaving ample space between it and the scene below. This positioning ensures clarity and prevents visual clutter, adhering to standard comic book or graphic design conventions where title text is typically placed above the main action. There is no evidence of clipping or overlap with any foreground or background elements.",

      "question": "Are the legs and rocking base of the horse proportionally accurate and aligned with the original mechanical structure, even after stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse's legs and rocking base are shown in both panels. In the bottom panel, the legs are proportionally similar to those in Image A—the front legs are slightly bent forward, and the back legs are angled backward, consistent with the rocking mechanism. The rocking base includes two curved rockers connected by a central frame, which matches the original design. The wheels attached to the legs are also present and correctly placed, allowing for movement. While the top panel simplifies the legs into more rigid, cartoonish shapes, the bottom panel maintains accurate proportions and alignment with the original mechanical structure. Even with stylization, the core functional elements—such as the pivot point and wheel placement—are preserved. The only minor deviation is slight exaggeration in limb thickness for comedic effect, but this does not compromise structural accuracy.",
