      "question": "Does the elongated body retain smooth, continuous curvature along the side and rear panels without sharp edges or unnatural bulges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The object in Image B is a highly stylized, metallic, boat-like structure resembling a luxury vehicle in form but clearly not a car. Its elongated body has a sleek, reflective silver surface with flowing contours. The side and rear panels exhibit a continuous, smooth curvature consistent with high-end design aesthetics, particularly those seen in vintage speedboats or conceptual art pieces. There are no visible sharp edges or unnatural bulges; instead, the surface appears uniformly polished and seamlessly curved. This smoothness is typical of hand-crafted metalwork intended to reflect light elegantly. Given its artistic nature, the design prioritizes fluidity over mechanical precision, which supports the conclusion that it maintains smooth, continuous curvature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the glass bases at the wheel positions transparent with visible internal texture, evenly shaped, and grounded flush with the platform without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the object rests on three cylindrical supports positioned where wheels would be on a car. These supports appear to be made of clear, textured glass or crystal, with a pattern resembling fish-scale or diamond-cut textures, commonly used in decorative glassware. They are transparent, allowing visibility into their internal structure, and each is uniformly shaped—cylindrical with a consistent diameter and height. They are placed directly on the black circular platform, appearing firmly grounded and flush with the surface, with no visual indication of floating or clipping artifacts. Their placement and material suggest intentional design for aesthetic display rather than functional support. The lighting reflects off them cohesively, indicating proper rendering without technical flaws.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the silver cap centered on the roof area, with clean edges and reflective surface that matches the surrounding chrome elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top center of the object in Image B, there is a small, spherical silver cap mounted on a short stem. It is precisely centered along the longitudinal axis of the elongated body, suggesting symmetry and balance in design. The cap has a polished, reflective surface that mirrors the surrounding chrome finish of the main body. Its edges are sharp and well-defined, indicating careful craftsmanship. The reflection and sheen are consistent with the rest of the metallic surface, reinforcing the idea that it is part of a unified design language. This feature resembles a finial or ornament often found on classic boats or luxury accessories, further supporting its role as a stylistic highlight.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the embossed text along the side panel clearly legible, aligned with the body's curvature, and rendered with subtle depth and shadow to match the material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The side panel of the object features the word 'BENTLY' embossed twice, once near the front and once near the rear. The text is clearly legible despite being integrated into a curved surface. It follows the natural contour of the body, maintaining alignment with the flow of the design. The embossing includes subtle depth and soft shadows, giving it a three-dimensional appearance consistent with raised metal lettering. The material appears to be polished aluminum or stainless steel, and the text’s finish matches the surrounding surface in both tone and reflectivity. This suggests careful attention to detail in modeling and rendering, ensuring realism in texture and integration with the overall form.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wave patterns flow continuously across the surface without repeating tiles, jagged edges, or mismatched lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Running along the side of the object are ornamental wave patterns that mimic water ripples. These patterns extend from one end to the other in a continuous, flowing manner. There are no visible seams, tile repetitions, or abrupt transitions that would suggest digital cloning or poor texture mapping. The curves of the waves follow the body’s shape smoothly, and the lighting interacts consistently across the surface—highlights and reflections align naturally with the undulations. This indicates a high-quality 3D model or physical craftsmanship where the pattern was either sculpted by hand or generated with advanced software to maintain continuity. No jagged edges or lighting mismatches are apparent, supporting the conclusion that the wave design is seamless and well-executed.",
