      "question": "Does the character’s face retain natural proportions and smooth contours despite the half-cartoon style transformation, without visible distortion in facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face is rendered in a stylized, cartoon-like manner typical of animated illustrations. The facial features—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—are simplified and exaggerated for expressive effect, which is common in animation. However, the proportions remain consistent with human anatomy: the eyes are placed at an appropriate height relative to the eyebrows and nose, the jawline is smooth and symmetrical, and the cheekbones are subtly defined. While the style is not photorealistic, it adheres to established cartoon aesthetics that preserve recognizable facial structure. There are no obvious distortions such as stretched features or misaligned symmetry. Compared to Image A, where the face is highly detailed and realistic, Image B simplifies but does not deform the facial geometry. This suggests that even in a stylized form, the artist maintained anatomical plausibility through careful design choices.",

      "question": "Is the elongated book's shape geometrically consistent with a real book, maintaining uniform page thickness and aligned edges without warping or stretching artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open book on the desk appears slightly elongated compared to standard proportions, particularly in its horizontal length. Upon closer inspection, the pages show a consistent thickness throughout, and the edges align properly along the spine. The curvature of the pages near the binding is smoothly rendered, indicating attention to how paper behaves when opened. However, the overall length of the book exceeds what would be typical for a physical book of this size, suggesting intentional exaggeration for visual appeal—a common trait in cartoon art. Despite this artistic liberty, there are no clear signs of warping, stretching, or inconsistent layering. The perspective remains coherent, with parallel lines converging appropriately. Compared to Image A, where the book is more realistically proportioned, Image B stretches the dimensions slightly but maintains structural integrity. Thus, while not perfectly scaled, the book retains geometric consistency within the stylistic context.",

      "question": "Do the sleeves exhibit natural fabric draping with consistent lighting, shadow depth, and fold patterns that align with gravity and textile behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sleeves in Image B are designed in a loose, flowing style typical of animated characters. The folds appear soft and follow a logical path from the shoulder down to the wrist, consistent with how lightweight fabrics like cotton or linen might drape under gravity. Shadows are applied selectively to suggest volume and depth, with darker areas beneath the arm and along creases, enhancing the three-dimensional illusion. The lighting seems to originate from the upper right (matching the lamp), casting subtle highlights on the outer surfaces of the sleeve. Although the rendering is simplified compared to real-world textures, the fold patterns are plausible and do not violate physical laws. In contrast to Image A, where fabric texture and lighting are hyper-realistic, Image B uses stylized shading and fewer fine details, yet still conveys believable movement and weight. Therefore, the sleeves maintain a sense of natural draping within the cartoon aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the golden filigree details on the buttons clearly rendered and integrated into the button surface without visible artifacts, such as jagged edges or mismatched reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buttons on the character's vest in Image B feature intricate golden filigree designs, resembling traditional decorative knots. These details are cleanly outlined and uniformly colored, with no visible pixelation or jagged edges. The reflection and shading on the gold elements match the light source (the green lamp), creating a cohesive appearance. The filigree patterns are symmetrical and well-integrated into the circular shape of each button, suggesting careful digital artwork rather than low-resolution or poorly layered graphics. There are no apparent mismatches in highlight placement or color bleeding. When compared to Image A, where the buttons are simpler and less ornate, Image B introduces more complex detailing—but it does so without compromising clarity or visual harmony. The level of detail is consistent with high-quality 2D animation standards, where clean linework and proper lighting integration are essential.",

      "question": "Are the library shelves transformed into a wooden frame background with consistent wood grain, edge alignment, and depth cues that maintain spatial logic and avoid broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been reimagined from a full library setting into a framed wooden panel, likely representing a calendar or illustration border. The wood grain is consistently textured across the frame, with vertical striations and natural variation in tone that mimic real wood. The edges of the frame are straight and aligned, forming a rectangular structure that encloses the scene logically. Depth cues are present through shading on the inner edges of the frame and subtle gradients that suggest dimensionality. There are no broken lines, floating edges, or geometric inconsistencies. Unlike Image A, which depicts an expansive library with multiple rows of books and realistic perspective, Image B simplifies the environment into a single, stylized backdrop. This transformation is intentional and stylistically coherent—it replaces realism with a clean, illustrative format. The spatial logic remains intact because the frame serves as a bounded space that supports the central figure without introducing visual contradictions.",
