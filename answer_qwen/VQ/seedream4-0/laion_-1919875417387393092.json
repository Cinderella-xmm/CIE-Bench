      "question": "Is the glass cloche added over the pottery setup transparent, smoothly shaped, and free of visible artifacts such as jagged edges or distorted reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cloche in Image B appears to be transparent, allowing a clear view of the pottery setup inside. Its shape is smooth and dome-like, which is typical for such objects designed to protect and display miniature scenes. There are no visible jagged edges or distorted reflections that would suggest imperfections or damage. The transparency and smoothness are consistent with the purpose of a glass cloche, which is to provide an unobstructed view while protecting the contents.",

      "question": "Do the clay pieces exhibit a uniform, realistic patina that blends naturally with their original gray tone without abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the clay pieces on the table exhibit a patina that seems uniform and realistic. The colors blend naturally with their original gray tone, and there are no abrupt color shifts or artificial-looking highlights. This suggests that the patina has been applied carefully to mimic the appearance of aged or used clay, enhancing the realism of the scene without disrupting the visual harmony.",

      "question": "Are the miniature fairies proportionally scaled to the pottery and tools, positioned realistically on or near the table, and anatomically accurate with intact limbs and natural poses?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature fairies in Image B are proportionally scaled relative to the pottery and tools, positioned realistically on or near the table. They appear anatomically accurate, with intact limbs and natural poses that suggest they are engaged in pottery-making activities. Their size and positioning contribute to the overall believability of the scene, making it seem like a miniature representation of a real-life activity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss and tiny flowers in Image B are placed along the edges of the wooden table with natural growth patterns and realistic textures. They do not cover critical structural components of the table, and their placement looks intentional and aesthetically pleasing. The textures of the moss and flowers appear detailed and lifelike, contributing to the overall realism of the scene without appearing artificially pasted.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden plaque in Image B is attached securely to the base and is correctly sized relative to the structure. It displays clear, readable engravings without any signs of warping or unnatural surface texture. The plaque's placement and design complement the overall aesthetic of the miniature scene, providing additional context and information without detracting from the main elements.",
