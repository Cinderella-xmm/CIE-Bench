      "question": "Do the armor elements on the central figure's torso and arms follow natural human body contours without causing distorted shapes or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure in Image B is adorned with elaborate ocean-themed armor that features intricate designs resembling coral, waves, and marine life. Upon close inspection, the armor appears to be sculpted to follow the underlying musculature and anatomy of the human body, particularly around the chest, shoulders, and biceps. The armor plates are segmented in a way that allows for articulation at joints such as the elbows and shoulders, suggesting careful attention to anatomical accuracy. There are no visible distortions, such as bulges or unnatural gaps, that would suggest misalignment or broken geometry. The curvature of the armor aligns with natural body contours—e.g., the pectoral region is broadened but not exaggerated, and the arm segments taper naturally toward the hands. This suggests a high degree of design coherence between the fantasy aesthetic and realistic human form.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the ocean-themed armor on the rightmost figure’s jacket smooth and continuous without visible tiling or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rightmost figure wears armor with detailed oceanic motifs, including what appear to be barnacles, kelp, and wave patterns. The texture application across the armor shows consistent detail and variation in shading, which contributes to a sense of depth and realism. However, upon closer examination, especially around the shoulder and forearm areas, subtle repetition in pattern elements—such as identical coral-like structures spaced too regularly—suggests possible texture tiling. Additionally, some transitions between different sections of the armor (e.g., where the sleeve meets the torso) exhibit slight seam lines or color mismatches, indicating imperfect blending. These artifacts are common in digital texturing when high-resolution maps are not properly UV-mapped or blended. While the overall effect is visually striking, these small inconsistencies indicate that the textures are not entirely seamless.",

      "question": "Does the right hand of the rightmost figure have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and joint curvature, even with armor applied?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right hand of the rightmost figure is partially obscured by shadow and armored gauntlets, but the visible portion reveals four distinct finger-like protrusions. The fifth finger appears either missing or merged into the glove structure due to the armor's design. Moreover, the spacing between the fingers seems compressed, and the curvature of the knuckles is exaggerated, likely due to the rigid nature of the armor. In real-world anatomy, fingers maintain consistent spacing and joint angles, but here, the armor appears to impose a stylized, non-anatomical shape. The lack of clear separation between the pinky and ring finger, along with the overemphasized thickness of the middle finger segment, suggests an artistic interpretation rather than anatomical fidelity. Therefore, while the intent may be to depict five fingers, the execution does not reflect natural human hand morphology.",

      "question": "Is the sky gradient from the horizon upward smooth and free of color banding or abrupt transitions between orange, blue, and purple hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B displays a gradient transitioning from warm orange near the horizon to deep purple and blue higher up. The transition appears largely smooth, with soft blending between colors, which is typical of high-quality digital compositing or HDR photography. However, upon close inspection—especially in the mid-tones between orange and purple—there are faint horizontal lines or striations that suggest minor color banding. These occur when there is insufficient color depth in the image data, leading to visible steps in the gradient instead of a seamless blend. While the effect is subtle and may not be noticeable at first glance, it is present enough to compromise the visual quality of the gradient. Thus, although the overall impression is of a beautiful sunset, the technical execution shows slight imperfections.",

      "question": "Is the typography at the bottom of the image clearly legible, properly aligned, and textured with ocean-spray effects without repeating patterns or sharp edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Sunset Guardians of the Coastlines' is rendered in a serif font with a distressed, weathered texture that mimics erosion or sea spray. The lettering is centered and horizontally aligned, contributing to balanced composition. Legibility is maintained despite the texture, as each character remains distinguishable. The ocean-spray effect is applied consistently across the letters, with splatter patterns that simulate water droplets or salt deposits. However, the texture shows some repetitive patterns—particularly in the white splashes around the edges—which resemble a repeated brush stroke or filter. Additionally, certain edges of the letters, especially in the 'S' and 'G', appear slightly jagged or pixelated, suggesting low-resolution rendering or anti-aliasing issues. While the artistic intent is clear, the presence of repeating textures and sharp edges undermines the illusion of organic wear.",

      "question": "Are the ocean creature motifs on the armor of the leftmost figure small, integrated, and positioned in a way that does not distort the armor’s form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leftmost figure's armor includes decorative elements resembling sea creatures such as octopuses, starfish, and fish. These motifs are relatively small and strategically placed on the shoulder pauldrons, chest plate, and lower legs. They appear to be sculpted into the surface of the armor rather than superimposed, allowing them to conform to the underlying curves. For example, the tentacle-like appendages wrap around the shoulder joint without disrupting its shape, and the starfish are embedded within the plate material rather than floating above it. This integration suggests intentional design choices to preserve structural integrity while adding thematic detail. No significant distortion of the armor’s silhouette or form is evident; the motifs enhance rather than interfere with the overall shape.",

      "question": "Do the shadows of the figures fall forward onto the rocks in alignment with the sun’s position behind them, and are the silhouettes sharp and unbroken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sun is positioned directly behind the central figure, creating backlighting that should cast shadows forward onto the rocks in front of the figures. However, in Image B, the shadows are not clearly visible on the foreground rocks. Instead, the figures appear as dark silhouettes against the bright sky, with minimal projection of shadow onto the ground. This could be due to the intensity of the backlighting overwhelming any subtle shadow detail, or because the lighting was digitally enhanced to prioritize dramatic contrast over realism. Furthermore, the silhouettes of the figures are mostly intact, but the edges are slightly softened or blurred, particularly around the limbs and hair, possibly due to post-processing effects like glow or feathering. While the general direction of light is consistent with the sun’s position, the absence of defined forward shadows and the softness of the silhouettes suggest a lack of photorealistic depth and precision.",
