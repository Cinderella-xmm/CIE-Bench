      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground maintain the structural integrity of the suit and cup without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi version of the person in the foreground is depicted with a suit and a cup. The suit appears to maintain its structural integrity, with visible seams and folds that suggest a natural fit on the character's body. The cup also looks proportionate and smooth, without any noticeable distortions or unnatural textures. The overall design adheres to typical 3D modeling practices for maintaining object realism within a stylized context.",

      "question": "Does the 3D chibi version of the person in the background retain the natural appearance of the suit and the warm glow of the lamp without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D chibi version of the person in the background retains the appearance of a suit with visible details like lapels and buttons, suggesting a natural look. The warm glow from the lamp behind him is softly rendered, contributing to the scene's ambiance without introducing artifacts. This aligns with common techniques used in 3D animation to simulate lighting effects realistically.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features and suit details of both chibi characters rendered with sufficient detail and texture to avoid looking unnatural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both chibi characters in Image B have facial features and suit details that are simplified yet recognizable. The faces exhibit large eyes and minimalistic expressions typical of chibi art, while the suits show basic textures and shading to avoid an overly flat appearance. These elements are consistent with the chibi style, which aims for a cute and approachable aesthetic rather than hyper-realism.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the hands of the chibi characters, especially the one holding the cup, appear proportionate and physically plausible without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the chibi characters, particularly the one holding the cup, appear proportionate to their bodies and physically plausible within the chibi art style. The hand holding the cup shows a gentle grip, and the fingers are slightly curved around it, which is a reasonable depiction given the stylized nature of the characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene enhance the visual credibility and realism of the composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the photo frame around the chibi-style 3D scene in Image B enhances the visual presentation by giving the impression of a finished artwork. However, it does not necessarily enhance realism since the content inside remains stylized. The frame serves more as a decorative element that complements the artistic style rather than increasing the scene's credibility in terms of realism.",
