      "question": "Does the stone-like texture applied to the mountain's surface exhibit uniformity and natural variation in roughness, without visible artifacts like repeating patterns or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central figure is a fantastical creature resembling a lion with wings and roots, standing atop a hill. The body of this creature has a stone-like texture that appears highly detailed, with variations in surface roughness mimicking natural rock formations. Upon close inspection, the texture shows subtle gradations in shading and depth, consistent with natural geological surfaces. There are no obvious repeating patterns such as those seen in low-quality textures or procedural generation artifacts. Instead, the roughness varies organically across the surface—thicker on the limbs and smoother around the joints—suggesting intentional artistic design aimed at realism. The transition between different parts of the body (e.g., torso to legs) is smooth and gradual, avoiding abrupt changes. This suggests a high level of texturing quality that aligns with professional digital art standards. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about digital sculpting and texturing techniques (such as those used in 3D modeling software), the texture exhibits natural variation and lacks artificial repetition.",

      "question": "Are the rock-carved eyes positioned symmetrically and proportionally on the mountain’s peak, with realistic depth and integration into the terrain, avoiding floating or misplaced features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not feature a mountain with carved eyes. Instead, it depicts a mythical creature with a lion-like head, which includes two prominent eyes. These eyes are located on the face of the creature, not on a mountain peak. The eyes are symmetrical, well-proportioned relative to the facial structure, and integrated into the stone-like skin of the creature. They have depth and appear to be part of the organic form rather than added elements. However, since the question refers to 'the mountain’s peak' having 'rock-carved eyes,' and there is no such element present in Image B—only a creature with natural-looking eyes—the premise of the question is based on a misidentification. The creature’s eyes are not carved into a mountain but are part of its anatomy. Therefore, the condition described in the question cannot be satisfied because the scenario does not exist in the image.",

      "question": "Do the wing-like ridges extend from the mountain’s sides in a way that follows natural geological lines and does not introduce sharp, broken, or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image does not show a mountain with wing-like ridges extending from its sides. Instead, the creature in Image B has large, feathered wings that resemble those of a griffin or phoenix. These wings are anatomically structured and extend from the creature’s back in a natural, biomechanically plausible manner. They follow the curvature of the body and taper outward with layered feathers, maintaining smooth gradients and realistic angles. While the wings are fantastical, their shape adheres to principles of organic form and aerodynamic design. However, the question specifically refers to 'wing-like ridges' on a mountain, implying geological formations. Since the image contains no mountain with such features—only a creature with biological wings—the premise of the question is incorrect. Thus, the condition cannot be met.",

      "question": "Are the limbs of the creature integrated with the tree silhouettes in a way that avoids visual conflicts such as overlapping branches appearing behind solid limbs or disconnected joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the creature’s lower body transitions into a network of roots that merge with the ground and surrounding trees. The roots appear to grow out from the creature’s legs and intertwine with the base of nearby trees. The integration is visually coherent: the roots wrap around tree trunks and spread across the terrain without any clear signs of overlapping or clipping errors. Branches of the trees do not appear to pass behind solid limbs; instead, they seem to emerge from the same root system, suggesting a symbiotic or fused relationship between the creature and the environment. The depth cues, lighting, and shadowing support this seamless fusion. There are no visible disconnects or floating elements. From a digital art perspective, this kind of integration requires careful layering and compositing, and here it is executed well, avoiding typical rendering artifacts. Thus, the limbs and trees are harmoniously combined without visual conflict.",

      "question": "Do the luminous veins emit a soft glow that blends with the blue and pink hues of the sky, without creating bright halos, sharp edges, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B has glowing veins running along its body, emitting light in shades of blue and purple. These veins are embedded within the stone-like skin and emit a soft, diffused glow. The light does not appear harsh or overexposed; instead, it gently illuminates the surrounding surface, enhancing the texture without washing out details. The glow interacts subtly with the ambient light of the sky, which transitions from blue to pink at sunset. The edges of the glow are smooth and blurred, lacking sharp boundaries or halo effects that would indicate poor post-processing. This soft emission contributes to a magical yet natural atmosphere, consistent with fantasy art styles. Given the lighting conditions and color harmony, the glow integrates well with the environment, avoiding visual distractions. Therefore, the luminous veins meet the criteria for soft, blended illumination.",
