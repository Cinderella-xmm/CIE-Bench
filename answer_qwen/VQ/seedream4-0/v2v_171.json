      "question": "Does the chibi Funko Pop-style figure maintain the structural coherence of the child's facial features without introducing unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi Funko Pop-style figure in Image B has a stylized design typical of such figures, with exaggerated features like large eyes and a small nose. The facial structure is simplified but maintains coherence within the style's context. There are no unnatural distortions that disrupt the overall appearance; instead, the design adheres to the expected aesthetic of chibi characters. This conclusion is drawn from observing the proportions and style consistency.",

      "question": "Are the tech-related accessories added to the chibi figure free of unnatural textures and integrated smoothly with the figure's design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tech-related accessories, specifically the headphones on the chibi figure, appear to be integrated smoothly into the design. They have a clean texture that matches the figure's overall look, without any visible anomalies or disruptions. The integration suggests careful attention to detail in the design process, ensuring that the accessories complement rather than clash with the figure's appearance.",

      "question": "Does the casual attire of the chibi figure retain its realistic texture and detail, avoiding any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The casual attire of the chibi figure retains a realistic texture and detail appropriate for a Funko Pop-style figure. While the fabric details are simplified as per the style, they still convey the material's essence, such as the denim jeans and the t-shirt. The level of detail is consistent with what one would expect from such a collectible item, avoiding any significant loss of fine details.",

      "question": "Is the cross-legged sitting pose of the chibi figure with the tablet anatomically plausible and free of any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cross-legged sitting pose of the chibi figure holding the tablet is anatomically plausible within the constraints of the chibi art style. The limbs are proportionate and positioned in a way that mimics a natural sitting posture. There are no signs of unnatural deformations that would make the pose seem awkward or impossible.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure outside the packaging exhibits textures and lighting that contribute to a visually plausible product visualization. The lighting highlights the figure's features and accessories realistically, enhancing its three-dimensional appearance. The textures are consistent with the materials depicted, giving the figure a lifelike quality despite its stylized nature.",
