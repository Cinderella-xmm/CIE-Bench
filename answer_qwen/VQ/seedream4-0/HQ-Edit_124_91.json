      "question": "Does the dancer have exactly one visible arm extended in a dynamic pose, with no additional limbs or distorted joints present?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer is depicted in a classical ballet-like pose. Her right arm is raised gracefully above her head, forming an elegant arc, while her left arm extends outward to the side. Both arms are clearly visible and anatomically proportionate, with no signs of extra limbs or joint distortions. The positioning of the arms appears natural and consistent with traditional dance poses, particularly those seen in formal or historical dance styles. There is no indication of unnatural duplication or warping of limbs. Based on visual inspection and common knowledge of human anatomy and dance choreography, both arms are present and correctly positioned. Therefore, the statement that only one arm is extended is incorrect.",

      "question": "Is the Renaissance-style dress composed of smooth, coherent fabric with natural draping and detailed embroidery, showing no pixelation, repetition, or textural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B features rich red velvet with gold brocade patterns, typical of Renaissance-era fashion. The fabric appears smooth with natural folds and draping that follow gravitational logic, suggesting realistic textile behavior. Embroidery details such as floral motifs and ornamental borders are finely rendered, with consistent texture across the surface. There is no visible pixelation, tiling, or repetitive patterns that would suggest digital artifacts. The transition between the red outer layer and golden inner lining is seamless, and the material appears cohesive. Given the high resolution and artistic quality of the image, combined with knowledge of historical costume design, the dress demonstrates excellent craftsmanship in its digital rendering.",

      "question": "Are the necklaces made of clearly defined pearls and gold filigree elements that appear three-dimensional, properly scaled, and seamlessly integrated with the dress?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer wears a multi-strand pearl necklace with a central gold pendant featuring intricate filigree work. The pearls are uniformly sized and reflect light realistically, indicating depth and volume. The gold elements exhibit fine detailing, with shading and highlights that suggest three-dimensionality. The necklace sits naturally against the bodice of the dress, without floating or clipping issues. The scale of the jewelry matches the proportions of the dancer’s figure, and it blends well with the opulent style of the gown. From a visual and artistic standpoint, the accessories are well-integrated into the overall composition, adhering to principles of realism and historical accuracy in costume design.",

      "question": "Does the background display Renaissance-style columns, arches, and fresco paintings with consistent perspective, proportion, and material textures that match historical architecture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features architectural elements characteristic of Renaissance design: tall fluted columns with ornate capitals, rounded arches, and frescoes depicting classical scenes on the walls and ceilings. These frescoes include figures in flowing robes, reminiscent of religious or mythological themes common in Italian Renaissance art. The perspective is accurate, with converging lines leading toward a vanishing point, creating a sense of depth. The materials—such as stone columns and painted plaster—are textured realistically, and the lighting enhances the three-dimensionality of the space. The overall composition aligns with known examples of Renaissance palatial interiors, such as those found in Florence or Rome. Thus, the background exhibits historically accurate and visually coherent architectural details.",

      "question": "Is the dancer’s supporting leg planted firmly on the floor with the other leg lifted in a natural arc, maintaining balance and anatomical correctness without exaggerated or broken joint angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s right leg is firmly planted on the ground, supporting her body weight, while her left leg is lifted behind her in a graceful extension. The knee of the lifted leg is bent at a natural angle, and the foot points downward in a manner consistent with classical dance technique. The alignment of the spine, hips, and legs suggests proper balance and posture. There are no signs of joint distortion, unnatural curvature, or biomechanical errors. The pose resembles a standard ballet or court dance position, where the raised leg follows a smooth arc without overextension. This reflects anatomical correctness and adherence to principles of dance movement.",
