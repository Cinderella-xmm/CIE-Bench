    "Question": "Q1: Do the extended page edges blend naturally into the frame without introducing any unnatural breaks or abrupt transitions at the corners?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the extended page edges appear to smoothly continue from the original book's pages, maintaining a consistent curvature and thickness. The corners of the extended pages do not show any sharp discontinuities or jagged edges that would suggest digital manipulation. The transition from the original page to the extended portion is seamless, with no visible seams or artifacts. This suggests that the extension was carefully rendered to match the natural fold and edge profile of the book. Based on visual cues such as smooth gradients in lighting and shadow, and the continuity of paper texture, it appears that the extended edges integrate well into the frame. There are no abrupt changes in color, tone, or geometry at the corners, which supports a natural blending effect.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the curved shadow cast by the extended pages follow the lighting direction present in the original image, contributing to a natural perception of depth?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to originate from the upper left, casting soft shadows toward the lower right. The extended pages create a subtle curved shadow that follows this directional consistency. The shadow is not overly sharp or misaligned but gently curves along the contour of the page extension, reinforcing the illusion of depth. In comparison to typical real-world lighting behavior, where shadows align with light source direction and object shape, this shadow placement is plausible. The gradient of the shadow also matches the ambient lighting seen on the wooden table and the book’s spine, indicating careful attention to lighting coherence. Therefore, the shadow enhances realism rather than detracting from it.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the texture and fine details of the extended pages consistent with the original pages, with no visible loss or distortion of the text and paper grain?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the extended pages in Image B display text and paper texture that closely resemble those of the original pages. The font style, line spacing, and ink density appear uniform across both the original and extended sections. The paper grain is subtly visible and maintains a similar level of detail, suggesting high-resolution rendering. There is no noticeable blurring, pixelation, or warping of the text—common signs of digital distortion. Additionally, the slight yellowing and aging effect on the paper is consistently applied, enhancing authenticity. Since these details are preserved without artificial smoothing or over-sharpening, the extended content appears to be a faithful continuation of the original.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the curvature of the extended pages consistent with the perspective of the original image, creating a believable unfolding effect without distorting the geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The curvature of the extended pages in Image B aligns well with the perspective of the original book. The book is angled slightly upward from the viewer’s point of view, and the extended pages follow this angle while maintaining a natural arc that mimics how real paper bends under gravity and physical constraints. The geometry of the pages does not exhibit unnatural stretching or compression; instead, the fold lines and creases appear continuous and realistic. The way the pages fan out respects the 3D structure of the book, preserving the spatial relationship between the spine, cover, and inner pages. This adherence to physical plausibility contributes to a convincing unfolding effect, making the extension appear as if it were part of the original book.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the interaction between the base of the book and the wooden table appear natural, with no unrealistic gaps or overlaps introduced by the extension of the pages?",
    "explanation": "The base of the book in Image B rests firmly on the wooden surface, and the extended pages do not intrude beneath or lift the book unnaturally. There is no visible gap between the bottom edge of the book and the table, nor is there an overlap that would suggest floating or misalignment. The shadow under the book remains consistent with its physical presence, and the extension of the pages does not alter the contact area between the book and the table. From a physics standpoint, adding pages should not affect the book's stability unless the weight distribution changes significantly—but here, the added pages seem lightweight and do not cause any visible shift in position or pressure points. Thus, the interaction remains natural and grounded in reality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
