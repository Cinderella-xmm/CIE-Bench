      "question": "Does the line-art representation of the elderly man maintain accurate proportions and natural joint alignment in his tai chi stance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elderly man is depicted in a traditional tai chi pose, with one leg bent and the other extended slightly behind, which is consistent with common tai chi stances such as 'Golden Rooster Stands on One Leg.' The line art shows clear outlines of the limbs, torso, and head. The proportions appear balanced: the head is appropriately sized relative to the body, the arms are proportionate to the torso, and the legs maintain anatomical alignment. The knee of the bent leg is aligned over the ankle, indicating proper joint mechanics. The spine appears straight, and the shoulders are relaxed, which aligns with correct tai chi posture. There is no visible distortion in limb length or joint angles (e.g., elbows, knees), suggesting that the artist maintained anatomical accuracy within the stylized line-art format. This conclusion is supported by general knowledge of human anatomy and tai chi form standards.",

      "question": "Are the pastel watercolor tones applied uniformly across the scene, preserving smooth gradients and avoiding harsh edges or inconsistent color zones?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a soft, watercolor aesthetic characterized by gentle transitions between colors. The background features light pink and peach hues for the cherry blossoms, blending into pale yellows and whites near the horizon, creating a dreamy atmosphere. These colors transition smoothly without sharp lines or abrupt changes, indicative of proper watercolor technique. The ground tiles have subtle shading that mimics natural light diffusion, and the figure's clothing blends softly with the surrounding tones. There are no visible hard edges or clashing color blocks, and the overall tone remains harmonious. The use of translucent washes suggests uniform application, consistent with watercolor painting principles. Thus, based on visual cues and artistic conventions, the tonal application is uniform and gradient-rich.",

      "question": "Are the cherry blossom patterns integrated naturally into the background, maintaining depth and perspective consistency with the existing trees and mist?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherry blossom branches in Image B extend from the left side of the frame, with delicate pink flowers and thin stems. They are layered above the faint silhouettes of trees in the midground, which are rendered in lighter, more translucent tones to suggest distance. The mist effect enhances depth by softening distant elements, and the blossoms appear to float in the foreground without disrupting this spatial hierarchy. The perspective is consistent: closer blossoms are more detailed and saturated, while those further back fade into the background. This layering aligns with standard principles of atmospheric perspective. Additionally, the blossoms do not overlap or obscure the main subject in an unnatural way, maintaining visual coherence. Therefore, the integration of cherry blossoms respects both compositional depth and environmental realism within the artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the date grids placed in a way that respects the spatial boundaries of the scene, such as being anchored to the ground or wall without overlapping the man’s body or distorting his silhouette?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the top of Image B, there are four small rectangular grids resembling calendar layouts. These are positioned horizontally across the upper portion of the image, well above the figure and the foreground elements. They are aligned along the top edge, appearing as if mounted on a wall or floating in the sky, but they do not intersect with the man’s silhouette or any key background features. Their placement does not distort the composition or obstruct the view of the subject. While their presence is somewhat surreal—since calendars are typically grounded—they are contained within the upper margin of the frame and do not intrude upon the spatial integrity of the scene. From a design standpoint, they respect the visual boundaries and do not interfere with the primary subject. Hence, despite their unusual context, they are spatially respectful.",

      "question": "Does the hand forming the \"OK\" gesture have exactly five fingers, with natural joint curvature and no elongated, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The right hand of the elderly man in Image B is raised and forms a gesture resembling the 'OK' sign, where the thumb and index finger touch to create a circle, and the other three fingers are extended. Upon close inspection, all five fingers are present: thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky. Each finger displays appropriate curvature at the knuckles, consistent with natural hand anatomy. There are no signs of elongation, duplication, or missing digits. The joints are subtly defined, showing realistic bending at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. The gesture is anatomically plausible and stylistically consistent with the rest of the illustration. Even in a simplified line-art style, the number and shape of the fingers remain accurate. This assessment is supported by basic human anatomy and typical depictions of hand gestures in art.",
