      "question": "Are the outlines of the church's steeple, roof, and walls clearly defined and geometrically consistent, without broken or warped edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is rendered in a stylized, cartoon-like art style. The steeple, roof, and walls are outlined with clean, sharp lines that follow geometric shapes such as triangles and rectangles. Despite the whimsical nature of the scene, the structure maintains symmetry and proportionality typical of architectural design. The edges are smooth and continuous, with no visible warping or breaks. This consistency aligns with common artistic conventions in animated or illustrated environments where clarity and visual coherence are prioritized. The use of clear outlines ensures the building remains recognizable and structurally plausible within the fantasy context. There is no distortion or irregularity in the geometry, suggesting intentional and careful design.",

      "question": "Do the stained-glass windows display clear, coherent patterns with smooth color transitions and no pixelation or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stained-glass windows in Image B feature colorful, segmented designs typical of stained glass, with distinct sections separated by dark leading lines. Each window displays a mosaic of vibrant colors—reds, blues, yellows, and greens—that transition smoothly within each segment. The edges of the colored panes are sharp but not jagged, and there is no visible pixelation, which would suggest low resolution or poor rendering. The patterns are symmetrical and coherent, resembling traditional stained-glass artistry. In this stylized cartoon depiction, the emphasis is on clarity and aesthetic appeal rather than photorealism, yet the rendering achieves high visual fidelity within its artistic framework. Therefore, the windows appear well-defined and professionally executed.",

      "question": "Are the candy-like tree replacements composed of smooth, continuous shapes with consistent surface textures, and do they maintain plausible proportions relative to the church?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are whimsically designed to resemble candy, with features like lollipops, candy canes, and striped trunks. These elements are composed of smooth, rounded shapes with consistent textures—such as polka dots, swirls, and stripes—that are evenly distributed across their surfaces. The forms are continuous and lack abrupt discontinuities, contributing to a cohesive fantasy aesthetic. Regarding proportions, while the trees are exaggerated in size and shape (e.g., large lollipops on branches), they remain visually balanced relative to the church. The church itself is scaled appropriately so that it does not appear dwarfed or oversized compared to the fantastical flora. In a surreal or fairy-tale setting, such proportion adjustments are acceptable and even expected. Thus, despite the fantastical nature, the trees maintain internal consistency and plausible scaling within the world’s logic.",

      "question": "Does the patchwork quilt sky feature uniform stitching lines and consistent color blending between patches, with no visible seams or sharp discontinuities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B is depicted as a large, circular patchwork quilt made up of concentric rings of fabric squares in various pastel colors and patterns. Each square has distinct borders that resemble stitching lines, and these lines are uniformly spaced and consistent in thickness throughout the composition. The color transitions between adjacent patches are smooth, with no harsh contrasts or visible gaps. While the patches vary in pattern (some have polka dots, others checks), the overall effect is harmonious and seamless. The curvature of the quilted sky suggests a dome-like structure, and the radial symmetry enhances the illusion of continuity. There are no sharp discontinuities or missing segments, indicating careful design and attention to visual cohesion. This representation adheres to the principles of textile art and digital illustration, where texture and repetition create an immersive environment.",

      "question": "Do the light sources from the church windows cast consistent, soft shadows on the surrounding grass and path, matching the direction and intensity of the internal glow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church windows emit a warm, yellow-orange glow, suggesting an internal light source such as lamps or candles. However, the shadows cast by the church onto the grass and path are minimal and lack directional consistency. The lighting appears flat and evenly diffused, with no discernible shadow gradients or elongated silhouettes that would result from a localized light source. In real-world physics, light from windows should cast soft, angled shadows depending on the time of day and position of the light. Here, the absence of such shadows indicates a stylized, non-photorealistic approach to lighting. The cartoonish art style prioritizes brightness and mood over realistic illumination effects. Therefore, while the glow is present, it does not produce corresponding shadows that match its direction or intensity. This is a deliberate artistic choice rather than a flaw, but it means the lighting behavior does not adhere to physical realism.",
