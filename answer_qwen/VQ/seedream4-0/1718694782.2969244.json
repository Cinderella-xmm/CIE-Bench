      "question": "Are the motion lines surrounding the character in Panel 1 smoothly aligned with the direction of motion and free from jagged edges or inconsistent spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the motion lines are radiating outward from the character’s body, indicating forward momentum as he leaps off the cliff. These lines are predominantly straight and extend diagonally backward, consistent with the direction of motion (from left to right). They are evenly spaced and exhibit a uniform thickness, with no visible jagged edges or irregularities. The lines are stylized in a way typical of comic art to emphasize speed and dynamic action. Based on visual inspection and common comic book conventions, such motion lines are designed to be smooth and aligned to enhance the perception of movement without distracting artifacts. Therefore, they meet the criteria for being smoothly aligned and free from defects.",

      "question": "Is the internal monologue bubble positioned close to the character’s head without overlapping facial features or distorting the character’s outline?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, the speech bubble containing the text 'The jump of a lifetime awaits!' is placed above and slightly to the left of the character’s head. It does not touch or overlap any part of his face or hair, maintaining a clear separation that preserves the integrity of the character’s outline. The tail of the bubble points toward the character’s mouth area, which is standard for dialogue placement in comics. There is no distortion of the character's form due to the bubble, and it adheres to conventional layout practices where speech bubbles avoid clipping into characters. Thus, the positioning is correct and unobtrusive.",

      "question": "Does the sky background in Panel 1 display a smooth gradient from warm to cool tones without visible color bands or unnatural transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 1 features a sunset sky with a vibrant gradient transitioning from warm orange and yellow near the horizon to cooler purples and pinks higher up. The transition between these colors appears seamless, with no visible banding or abrupt shifts in hue. This smooth blending is consistent with natural atmospheric lighting during sunrise or sunset, where light scatters across different wavelengths. Additionally, the gradient enhances the dramatic effect of the scene without introducing digital artifacts such as color quantization or pixelation. Given the high-quality rendering and adherence to realistic lighting principles, the sky displays a natural and smooth gradient.",

      "question": "Is the parachute in Panel 2 correctly shaped, proportionally sized relative to the character, and connected by visible cords that extend logically from the character’s back?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 2, the parachute is depicted as a large, dome-shaped canopy with alternating red and orange sections, resembling a typical sport parachute. Its size is appropriate relative to the character beneath it — significantly larger than the person but not exaggeratedly so. The parachute is attached via multiple thin cords that originate from the harness worn by the character and extend upward to the canopy, forming a logical and structurally plausible connection. These cords are clearly visible and converge at the top of the parachute, consistent with real-world parachute design. There is no indication of incorrect proportions or illogical attachment points, suggesting accurate representation based on world knowledge of parachuting equipment.",

      "question": "Do the animated clouds in both panels appear as distinct volumetric forms with soft edges and no clipping into the character or mountain silhouettes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels, the clouds are rendered with soft, rounded edges and a sense of volume, giving them a three-dimensional appearance. In Panel 1, the clouds are set against the colorful sky and do not intersect with the character or the mountain silhouette; they remain behind the foreground elements. In Panel 2, the clouds are similarly positioned in the background and maintain clean separation from the character and mountains. No clipping or overlapping occurs where the clouds would intrude upon the outlines of the character or terrain. Their placement follows depth layering principles used in animation and illustration, ensuring clarity and spatial coherence. Therefore, the clouds are properly designed and composited without visual errors.",
