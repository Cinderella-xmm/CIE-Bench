    "Question": "Q1: Does the character's crouched pose maintain natural limb proportions and joint alignment without exaggerated or distorted angles?",
    "explanation": "The character is depicted in a low crouch, with one knee bent and the other leg extended behind her, supporting her weight. Her arms are positioned to maintain balance—her right hand grips a weapon while her left hand rests on the ground. The joints (knees, elbows, shoulders) appear anatomically plausible, with no visible distortion such as unnaturally bent knees or dislocated elbows. The limbs are proportionate to the body, and the musculature suggests realistic tension consistent with a crouching stance. The pose reflects a dynamic yet grounded posture typical of stealth or combat-ready characters in comic art. There are no exaggerated angles that would suggest deformation, and the overall silhouette aligns with human biomechanics. Therefore, the pose maintains natural proportions and joint alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the rooftop ledge positioned directly under the character’s feet with consistent shadow direction and material texture that matches the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "The character is seated on a rooftop ledge, and her feet rest firmly on the surface. The ledge appears to be made of concrete or stone, matching the urban architectural style seen in the background. The shadow beneath her is cast forward and slightly to the side, consistent with a light source coming from above and slightly behind her, which aligns with the spotlight beams illuminating the scene. The texture of the ledge shows subtle wear and grime, fitting for an outdoor city rooftop. The edge is clearly defined, and the character's feet are positioned naturally along it, suggesting physical contact and stability. There is no visual inconsistency in shadow direction or material texture that would imply misalignment or mismatch with the environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the distant skyscrapers and spotlights in the background properly scaled and positioned to match the character’s viewpoint and lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "The background features a cityscape at night, with prominent skyscrapers including a tall building resembling the Empire State Building, illuminated in blue tones. The perspective places the character in the foreground, looking toward the viewer, with the skyline receding into the distance. The scale of the buildings is consistent with a high vantage point (e.g., a rooftop), and their relative sizes diminish appropriately with depth. The spotlights, located on the right side of the image, project beams upward and slightly toward the center, aligning with the lighting on the character’s figure and the ambient glow on the buildings. The direction of illumination supports the idea that the light sources are behind and to the side of the character, creating a cohesive lighting scheme. The positioning and scaling of elements in the background adhere to principles of linear perspective and atmospheric depth, reinforcing a believable urban nighttime setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the claws exhibit a metallic glint that follows the direction of the spotlight illumination without excessive or misplaced reflections?",
    "explanation": "The character’s claws are rendered with sharp, reflective surfaces, and they show highlights that correspond to the direction of the spotlight beams coming from the right side of the image. These highlights appear along the edges of the claws, where light would naturally reflect off a polished metal surface. The reflections are concentrated on the upper and outer surfaces of the claws, consistent with the angle of the light source. There are no random or overly bright reflections that would suggest unrealistic lighting behavior. The metallic sheen is subtle but present, enhancing the sense of materiality without overemphasizing glossiness. This treatment aligns with standard practices in digital illustration for depicting reflective materials under directional lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the speech text clearly visible, properly aligned, and placed in a position that does not interfere with the character’s form or visual balance?",
    "explanation": "The speech bubble containing the text 'The night awaits...' is located in the upper right quadrant of the image, near the character’s head but not overlapping any critical features such as the face or hands. It is clearly legible with clean, white font on a black background, ensuring readability against the darker backdrop. The placement avoids obstructing the character’s form and maintains visual balance by being positioned away from the central focus of the composition. Speech bubbles are typically placed near the speaker’s mouth, and this one is angled appropriately to suggest origin from the character. Its size and shape are proportionate to the scene, contributing to the narrative without distracting from the visual impact of the character or setting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
