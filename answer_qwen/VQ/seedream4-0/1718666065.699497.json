      "question": "Is the surface of the unicorn’s body uniformly smooth and reflective, resembling a glazed ceramic finish without patches of residual fur texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn's body exhibits a consistent, glossy sheen across its entire form, particularly noticeable on the torso, legs, and head. The surface lacks any visible texture such as fur or hair-like patterns that might suggest organic material. Instead, it reflects light in a way characteristic of glazed porcelain or ceramic—smooth, uniform, and slightly translucent in certain areas. This appearance is typical of high-quality ceramic sculptures, where the glaze creates a seamless, polished finish. There are no irregularities, bumps, or textured patches that would imply residual fur or natural skin texture. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of ceramic art, this surface is clearly intended to mimic a glazed finish rather than a biological one.",

      "question": "Are the mane and tail composed of thin, curved porcelain-like structures that follow the natural flow of the original hair and are securely attached to the head and base of the tail without floating or breaking apart?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mane and tail in Image B are sculpted with intricate, curling forms that resemble stylized waves or loops, consistent with porcelain or ceramic craftsmanship. These elements are tightly integrated into the body structure, showing no signs of detachment or floating. Each strand appears solid and continuous, forming a cohesive unit that follows the natural curvature expected in a horse’s mane and tail. The curls are evenly spaced and symmetrically arranged, suggesting careful handcrafting. In contrast to organic hair, which would appear more random and flexible, these features are rigid and permanent, indicating they are made from a hard material like porcelain. The attachment points at the neck and tail base are seamless, reinforcing their secure integration into the sculpture. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of ceramic art, the mane and tail meet the criteria described.",

      "question": "Does the horn form a continuous, symmetrical spiral shape made of reflective metallic material, originating from the same position as the original horn and maintaining proportional size relative to the head?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The horn in Image B is clearly distinct from the rest of the sculpture due to its metallic sheen and spiral design. It emerges from the forehead in the typical location for a unicorn horn, centered between the eyes. The spiral is tight and symmetrical, with each coil evenly spaced, giving it an elegant, almost mechanical appearance. Its reflective surface suggests it is made of metal or a metallic coating, contrasting sharply with the white ceramic body. The size of the horn is proportionate to the head, neither overly large nor small, fitting within the aesthetic balance of the sculpture. This matches known artistic representations of unicorns where the horn is a prominent but balanced feature. Given the visual evidence and understanding of sculptural design, the horn meets all specified criteria.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the unicorn positioned on a flat, subtly textured stone base that contrasts with the original forest floor, with no visible remnants of trees, dirt, or foliage in the immediate surroundings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the unicorn stands on a natural-looking stone slab that is irregular in shape but relatively flat, providing a stable foundation for the sculpture. The surface of the stone has a rough, earthy texture, contrasting with the smooth, glossy finish of the unicorn. The surrounding environment is minimalist—an open gallery space with plain walls, polished flooring, and framed artworks in the background. There are no trees, dirt, leaves, or other natural elements present near the base. This setting clearly differs from the dark, wooded forest floor seen in Image A, which includes moss, rocks, and tree roots. The absence of any outdoor elements confirms that the unicorn is displayed indoors on a purposefully chosen stone base, isolated from nature. Thus, the description aligns perfectly with the visual content.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting on the sculpture soft and directional, casting subtle highlights on the glazed surface and porcelain curls, consistent with indoor gallery illumination rather than outdoor moonlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is characterized by soft, diffused illumination coming from above, likely from ceiling-mounted spotlights commonly found in art galleries. This creates gentle highlights along the curves of the unicorn’s body, especially on the back, flanks, and edges of the mane. The reflections are smooth and controlled, enhancing the glazed finish without harsh glare. Shadows are soft and fall naturally beneath the sculpture, indicating overhead directional light sources. In contrast to the dramatic, ambient glow of moonlight seen in Image A—which casts deep shadows and illuminates the scene uniformly—the lighting here is focused and curated. The overall ambiance is calm and professional, typical of museum or gallery displays. Therefore, the lighting conditions are consistent with indoor gallery settings rather than outdoor nocturnal environments.",
