      "question": "Does the Funko Pop figure box maintain the structural coherence of the original image, avoiding any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Funko Pop figure box in Image B appears to be a digitally inserted element. Upon close inspection, the box has clean edges, consistent lighting, and realistic shadows that align with the ambient light in the scene. The texture of the box is sharp and detailed, matching typical packaging materials (cardboard and plastic), with no visible pixelation or warping. The text and graphics on the box are crisp and legible, suggesting high-quality rendering. The lighting on the box reflects the overhead lights seen in the background, which indicates careful attention to environmental consistency. There are no signs of unnatural textures or distortions such as blurring, stretching, or inconsistent shading. Therefore, the box maintains structural coherence within the image.",

      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine inside the box retain its proportions and physical rationality, avoiding any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figurine inside the box is consistent with the standard design of Funko Pop figures—exaggerated head, simplified limbs, and stylized features. Its proportions are accurate to the known Funko Pop aesthetic, with a large head relative to the body and minimal facial details. The figurine’s pose, holding a skateboard, is anatomically plausible within the stylized context. The details such as the helmet, clothing, and skateboard are rendered clearly and without deformation. There are no visible distortions like stretched limbs or warped joints. The figure's placement within the box also respects the depth and scale of the packaging, maintaining visual logic. Thus, the figurine retains its intended proportions and physical rationality.",

      "question": "Are the detailed textures and lighting on the realistic figurine outside the box natural and consistent with the rest of the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The realistic figurine outside the box is a stylized representation of a person, but it is not a real human. It has exaggerated features typical of Funko Pop designs, including large eyes and a simplified face. However, the textures on the figurine—such as the helmet, clothing, and shoes—are smooth and consistent with plastic toy materials. The lighting on the figurine matches the ambient lighting of the scene, with soft shadows and highlights that suggest a directional light source from above, consistent with the ceiling lights in the background. There are no harsh reflections or unnatural color shifts. While the figurine is not photorealistic, its appearance is coherent with the style of collectible toys and fits naturally into the scene without disrupting the lighting or texture continuity. Therefore, the textures and lighting are natural and consistent.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the original image and the edited elements seamless, free of unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the original skateboarding scene and the added Funko Pop elements is largely seamless. The box and figurines are placed on the same floor surface as the ramp, and their shadows fall consistently with the lighting direction from the ceiling lamps. The edges of the box are sharp and blend well with the surrounding environment, with no visible artifacts like haloing or misalignment. The textures of the box and figurines are clear and do not show signs of compression or degradation. Additionally, the depth of field and focus remain consistent across the scene, suggesting that the digital insertion was done with attention to perspective and scale. There is no noticeable loss of detail or unnatural texture that would indicate poor editing. Thus, the transition appears seamless.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the Funko Pop figure box and its contents maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the image, without disrupting visual credibility and structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While the original image (Image A) depicts a realistic skateboarding scene in an indoor skatepark, the edited version (Image B) introduces a fictional product—the Funko Pop figure—into a real-world setting. This creates a hybrid reality where the fantastical meets the real. However, the integration is handled with care: the lighting, shadows, and scale of the box and figurines are consistent with the environment. The graffiti-covered ramp and concrete walls provide a gritty backdrop that contrasts with the pop-culture toy, yet the contrast is not jarring due to the thoughtful composition. The figurine outside the box is positioned naturally, as if it were part of the scene. Although the presence of a toy in a real skatepark is surreal, the visual execution preserves structural consistency and avoids obvious digital flaws. Therefore, despite the conceptual shift, the image maintains visual credibility through technical precision.",
