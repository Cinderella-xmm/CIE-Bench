      "question": "Are the floral patterns and lace overlay smoothly blended into the gown without visible seams or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress appears to be rendered in a watercolor style, which inherently softens textures and edges. The floral patterns and lace overlay are integrated into the fabric of the gown with a translucent, painterly effect. There are no sharp lines or abrupt transitions between the lace and the base fabric, suggesting a smooth blending technique typical of watercolor art. The delicate shading and gradual color transitions indicate that the artist has intentionally avoided harsh seams or textural breaks. This is consistent with artistic rendering rather than photographic realism, where such imperfections would be more apparent. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of watercolor techniques, the integration appears seamless within the artistic context.",

      "question": "Does the hand show five fingers with natural positioning and no deformation, and is the bouquet held in a physically plausible manner?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hand holding the bouquet is depicted with five distinct fingers, each positioned in a way that suggests a gentle grasp. The fingers appear proportionate and naturally curved around the stem of the bouquet, which is consistent with how a person would hold flowers. The bouquet itself is composed of multiple blooms and greenery, arranged in a realistic cluster. The angle and grip suggest a balanced and stable hold, without any signs of unnatural stretching or distortion. While the image is stylized, the anatomical structure of the hand remains intact and plausible. Comparing this to typical human anatomy and common depictions in art, the hand's representation is accurate and functional. Thus, both the hand and the bouquet are rendered in a physically believable way.",

      "question": "Are the watercolor effects evenly distributed without obscuring facial features, dress details, or creating harsh color boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The watercolor effect in Image B is applied with soft gradients and subtle washes, particularly noticeable in the background and along the edges of the dress. The colors—primarily pastel pinks and creams—are diffused gently, avoiding hard edges. Facial features such as the eyes, nose, and lips remain clearly defined despite the artistic treatment, indicating careful control over opacity and layering. Details like the lace pattern on the dress and the floral crown are still visible and distinguishable, even though softened by the medium. There are no areas where the color bleeding overwhelms the subject or creates jarring contrasts. This suggests that the artist used a deliberate technique to maintain clarity while achieving an ethereal aesthetic. Given the nature of watercolor art, some slight blending is expected, but it does not compromise legibility or visual harmony.",

      "question": "Are the embossed edges consistently applied around the image, and is the paper sleeve positioned without overlapping or distorting the main subject?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the artwork framed within a decorative paper sleeve that has scalloped, embossed edges. These edges are uniformly applied around the perimeter of the card, maintaining symmetry and consistency in design. The embossing adds a tactile quality, enhancing the vintage feel of the piece. The paper sleeve is placed behind the illustration and does not extend over the central figure, ensuring that the bride and her attire remain fully visible and unobstructed. There is no evidence of misalignment or warping caused by the sleeve’s placement. The framing respects the composition, allowing the viewer to focus on the subject without interference. Based on standard practices in stationery design and presentation, this arrangement is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally appropriate.",

      "question": "Is the veil still attached correctly to the head, the floral crown intact and properly positioned, and the dress silhouette preserved without warping or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the veil is shown extending from the back of the head, flowing down alongside the dress in a graceful, continuous line. It appears securely attached at the crown, following the natural curve of the head and shoulders. The floral crown is positioned atop the hair, centered and symmetrical, with petals arranged in a realistic, organic fashion. The dress silhouette maintains its original shape—a long-sleeved, floor-length gown with a fitted bodice and flowing skirt—without any visible warping or stretching. Even under the watercolor rendering, the proportions of the body and clothing remain consistent with the intended design. There are no distortions in scale or perspective that would suggest digital manipulation errors. The overall composition preserves the elegance and structural integrity of the original subject.",
