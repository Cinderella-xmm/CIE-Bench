      "question": "Does the skateboard maintain its structural consistency and visual credibility after being converted into a stained glass style, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard has been transformed into a stained glass style, where its surface is composed of colorful, irregular geometric shapes separated by dark leading lines, mimicking traditional stained glass windows. Despite this artistic transformation, the overall shape and structure of the skateboard—its elongated deck, rounded edges, and placement of truck mounting holes—are preserved. The wheels remain visible and retain their circular form, though stylized. The visual credibility is maintained because the transformation respects the original object's silhouette and key functional features (e.g., wheel positions). While the texture is no longer realistic, it does not introduce unnatural distortions or lose essential structural details. The use of color variation within the glass-like segments adds depth without compromising recognition. Thus, the skateboard remains structurally consistent and visually credible in its new artistic form.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the kitchen sink and cabinets preserved without distortion, maintaining their physical rationality in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kitchen sink and cabinets in Image B are rendered in a stained glass aesthetic, with segmented colored panels outlined by dark lines resembling lead cames. However, upon close inspection, the sink’s rectangular shape and the cabinet doors’ rectangular frames are still recognizable, preserving their basic geometry. The faucet and countertop also maintain their general proportions. Although the style introduces angular fragmentation, the underlying forms remain coherent and do not exhibit significant warping or distortion. For example, the cabinet handles are still aligned correctly with the doors, and the sink basin retains its correct position relative to the faucet. This suggests that while the representation is stylized, the physical rationality of the objects is preserved through careful adherence to their original spatial relationships and proportions. The stained glass effect enhances rather than disrupts the structural logic of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the stained glass effect applied to the countertop and backsplash tiles appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The countertop and backsplash tiles in Image B have been reimagined using the stained glass motif, with each tile subdivided into colorful, angular fragments. While this artistic treatment is visually striking, it deviates from the real-world appearance of smooth, uniform tiles. However, there are no obvious digital artifacts such as jagged edges, pixelation, or inconsistent shading. The transitions between colors are smooth, and the leading lines follow a consistent pattern across surfaces. The effect appears intentional and cohesive, suggesting a deliberate artistic choice rather than a flawed rendering. Although the texture is clearly artificial and not 'natural' in a literal sense, the question asks whether it appears natural *within the context* of the stained glass style. Given that the entire image adopts this style uniformly, the countertop and backsplash integrate well, maintaining visual harmony. Therefore, while not realistic, the effect avoids noticeable technical flaws.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets visually credible and coherent, without any noticeable breaks or inconsistencies in the stained glass style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the skateboard, sink, and cabinets in Image B is visually coherent due to the consistent application of the stained glass style across all elements. The same technique—fragmented geometric shapes bounded by dark lines—is applied uniformly to the skateboard, cabinetry, countertop, and even the backsplash. There are no abrupt changes in style or texture at the boundaries between these objects. For instance, where the skateboard leans against the cabinet, the stained glass patterns flow seamlessly from one surface to the next, maintaining continuity in both color palette and line work. Even the metallic faucet and sink are stylized but integrated into the overall aesthetic without disrupting the visual flow. This seamless integration ensures that the viewer perceives a unified artistic vision rather than disjointed elements. Thus, despite the stylization, the transitions are credible and consistent within the chosen artistic framework.",

      "question": "Do the details of the objects, such as the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles, remain authentic and detailed within the stained glass style, avoiding any degradation of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the skateboard wheels and cabinet handles are stylized but still recognizable. The wheels retain their circular form and are depicted with a distinct orange hue, separated from the deck by dark leading lines. Similarly, the cabinet handles are represented as elongated, curved shapes that preserve their original orientation and function. While the fine details like the texture of metal or plastic are lost due to the stained glass abstraction, the essential shapes and positions are maintained. The artistic style simplifies complex textures but does not distort the core features of these components. For example, the wheel axles are implied by the positioning and spacing, and the handles remain proportionally accurate. Since the goal of the stained glass effect is artistic interpretation rather than photorealism, the preservation of shape and placement over micro-details is reasonable. Therefore, although some fine textural details are sacrificed, the authenticity of the object parts is upheld through structural fidelity.",
