      "question": "Are the eyes, nose, and mouth aligned symmetrically and proportionally, with no distorted shapes such as stretched eyelids or misshapen lips?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s facial features are rendered in a stylized cartoon aesthetic. The eyes are large and round, typical of anime or animated character design, and are symmetrically placed on either side of the vertical axis of the face. The nose is small and centrally located, consistent with common cartoon proportions. The mouth is wide and curved into a smile, with symmetrical upper and lower lips that appear proportionate to the rest of the face. While the style exaggerates certain features (like eye size), there is no visible distortion such as stretched eyelids or misshapen lips. The symmetry is maintained across both sides of the face, and the alignment follows standard principles of balanced facial composition in animation. This reflects intentional artistic design rather than technical flaws.",

      "question": "Is the camera proportionally enlarged but still held securely by both hands without floating or unnatural grip angles, and do the metallic accents show consistent highlights and reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The camera in Image B is clearly larger than realistic proportions, which is typical in stylized illustrations where objects are exaggerated for visual impact. However, it is held firmly by both hands, with fingers wrapped around the body and lens in a natural, stable grip. The angle of the hands and the positioning of the fingers suggest a secure hold, not a floating or awkward pose. The metallic parts of the camera—such as the lens barrel and top dials—have reflective highlights that follow logical light direction, indicating consistent shading and specular reflection. These highlights are smooth and coherent, suggesting attention to detail in rendering material properties. Although the scale is exaggerated, the grip and lighting remain plausible within the cartoon style.",

      "question": "Does the background gradient blend seamlessly with the subject’s edges, with no visible haloing, sharp cutoffs, or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a soft pastel gradient with subtle pink and green hues. The transition between the background and the subject's silhouette is smooth, with no hard edges or visible haloing effects. There is no evidence of color bleeding or jagged outlines around the hair or clothing. The blending appears deliberate and artistically cohesive, likely achieved through digital painting techniques that ensure edge softness and continuity. In contrast to real-world photo editing issues like chromatic aberration or poor masking, this image shows clean integration between foreground and background, consistent with high-quality illustration standards.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the decorative border composed of clean, continuous camera motifs that do not intersect with the subject’s face or clothing, and are there no pixelated or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The border surrounding Image B is made up of repeating camera icons in various colors and styles, arranged in a continuous pattern. These motifs are uniformly spaced and neatly aligned along all four edges, forming a complete frame. Importantly, the border does not overlap or intrude into the subject’s face or clothing—there is a clear margin separating the artwork from the frame. The lines are sharp and clean, with no visible pixelation, gaps, or broken segments, indicating high-resolution rendering and careful design. This suggests professional-level graphic design work where consistency and clarity were prioritized.",

      "question": "Are individual hair strands, denim stitching, and fabric folds clearly visible and undistorted, with no smoothing or blurring that removes detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is depicted with distinct strands that flow naturally, showing variation in thickness and direction, which adds depth and realism even within a stylized context. The denim jacket has visible stitching lines along the seams, pockets, and collar, rendered with consistent line weight and spacing, indicating attention to texture detail. Fabric folds on the shirt and jacket are clearly defined, with shading that suggests volume and movement. There is no noticeable blurring or over-smoothing; instead, the artwork maintains crisp outlines and fine details throughout. This level of clarity suggests the use of vector-based or high-resolution raster art techniques that preserve intricate elements without degradation.",
