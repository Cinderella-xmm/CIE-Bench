      "question": "Does the area on the train where people were previously sitting look natural without any obvious artifacts or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area where people were previously sitting appears to be filled with a conductor standing and holding a flag. The space looks smooth and continuous, suggesting that the removal of people was done carefully. There are no visible gaps or unnatural edges that would indicate poor editing. The visual cues such as the uniform color and texture of the train's surface in this region support the conclusion that it looks natural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the conductor added atop the train well-integrated with the existing lighting and shadows, giving a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The conductor in Image B is positioned under similar lighting conditions as the rest of the scene. The shadows cast by the conductor align with the direction of light coming from the sun, which suggests that the lighting has been considered during the addition. The conductor's figure blends naturally with the train's structure, indicating good integration. This analysis is based on observing the consistency of light and shadow across the image.",

      "question": "Does the flag held by the conductor look natural, with proper proportions and a logical position relative to the train's motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flag in Image B appears proportionate to the conductor and the train. Its position, slightly tilted backward, seems logical considering the train's forward motion, which would cause the flag to flutter naturally. The flag's design and placement do not seem out of place or disproportionate, supporting the conclusion that it looks natural.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any distortions or misalignments in the train's structure near the area where people were removed, and the conductor was added?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the train's structure around the edited areas does not show any noticeable distortions or misalignments. The lines and shapes remain consistent with the rest of the train, indicating careful editing. The conductor's addition does not disrupt the structural integrity of the train, maintaining a coherent appearance.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the image remain balanced and stable after editing, with no noticeable shifts caused by the removal and addition of people?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B maintains balance and stability. The elements within the frame, including the train, platform, and crowd, retain their original positions and proportions. The removal of people and addition of the conductor do not introduce any significant shifts or imbalances, ensuring the image remains visually harmonious.",
