      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the puzzle sections on the horseâ€™s body clearly defined with clean, interlocking edges that follow the natural curves of the horse's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the horse is depicted as a jigsaw puzzle with distinct sections. The edges of these sections appear to be cleanly cut and interlock in a way that follows the contours of the horse's body. This suggests an intentional design choice to mimic a three-dimensional puzzle where each piece fits into the next. The visual cues such as sharp lines and the alignment of the pieces along the horse's natural shape support this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the floral patterns on each puzzle section align seamlessly at the edges where pieces meet, maintaining visual continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the horse in Image B seem to continue across the puzzle sections without interruption. At the edges where the pieces meet, the flowers and designs appear to flow from one section to another, suggesting a careful design process to ensure visual continuity. This seamless alignment indicates that the artist paid attention to detail to maintain the aesthetic integrity of the overall pattern.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome over the horse clear and free from unnatural distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would suggest poor material simulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears transparent and allows for a clear view of the horse beneath it. There are no visible distortions, smudges, or irregular reflections that would detract from its realism. The dome seems to simulate a smooth, polished glass surface effectively, contributing to the lifelike presentation of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the wooden base exhibit realistic wood grain and texture, and is the compass embedded in a way that matches the surface plane and scale of the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B displays detailed wood grain and texture, giving it a realistic appearance. The compass embedded in the base looks proportionate and aligned with the surface plane, suggesting careful placement to match the scale and context of the base. These elements together enhance the authenticity of the object.",

      "question": "Are the antique-brass accents positioned logically on the frame and base, with a matte-to-slight-reflective finish consistent with aged metal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The antique-brass accents in Image B are placed in logical positions on the frame and base, serving both decorative and functional purposes. They have a finish that transitions from matte to slightly reflective, which is characteristic of aged metal. This finish adds to the vintage aesthetic of the entire composition, making the accents appear authentic and well-integrated.",
