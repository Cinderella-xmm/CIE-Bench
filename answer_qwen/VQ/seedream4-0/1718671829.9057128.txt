    "Question": "Q1: Are the wooden beams and roof supports rendered as consistent geometric shapes with sharp, clean edges and no warped or fractured sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and roof supports are depicted in a highly stylized, art-deco-inspired manner. The visual cues show that these elements are not naturalistic but rather abstracted into geometric forms with sharp, angular lines. The beams appear to have clean, straight edges, and their structure is composed of repeating patterns and symmetrical shapes, typical of art-deco design. There are no visible signs of warping or fracturing; instead, the lines are crisp and deliberate. This suggests a deliberate artistic choice to emphasize symmetry and precision over realism. Therefore, based on the visual representation and the stylistic intent (art-deco), the beams are consistently geometric with sharp edges.",

    "Question": "Q2: Is the moon a perfectly round shape with a smooth surface and uniform glow around its edge, without jagged outlines or uneven brightness?",
    "explanation": "The moon in Image B is rendered in a stylized fashion, featuring a bright, glowing orb with radiating lines emanating from its center, resembling a sunburst effect. While the core shape of the moon is circular, the surrounding glow is not uniform—it has sharp, star-like rays extending outward, which deviates from a natural lunar appearance. The edge of the moon itself appears smooth, but the overall luminance is not evenly distributed due to the added radiating lines. These artistic enhancements introduce a non-uniform brightness pattern. Thus, although the base shape is round, the glow and brightness are not uniform, and the outline includes jagged extensions from the radiating lines. This indicates a departure from a realistic, smoothly glowing moon.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the plants in the foreground and background arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without irregular spacing or fragmented shapes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the plants in both the foreground and background are stylized using geometric and symmetrical motifs consistent with the art-deco theme. The foliage is represented with sharp, angular forms, often resembling fan-like or spiky patterns, arranged in repeating sequences. For example, the plants at the bottom of the image are aligned in a mirrored, symmetrical fashion, creating a balanced composition. There is no evidence of irregular spacing or fragmented shapes—each plant element follows a clear, repetitive design. This structured arrangement reflects intentional artistic symmetry rather than natural randomness. Therefore, the plants are indeed arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the wooden surfaces and glass panes display metallic gold and silver accents with consistent sheen and reflection, without color bleeding or missing texture details?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a strong use of metallic textures, particularly gold and silver, applied to both wooden surfaces and glass panes. The wood beams and frames are overlaid with reflective metallic finishes that exhibit consistent sheen and specular highlights, suggesting a polished, almost chrome-like quality. The reflections are uniform across the surfaces, and there is no visible color bleeding or loss of detail. The transitions between colors (gold and silver) are sharp and well-defined, indicating careful rendering. Even the glass panes incorporate metallic borders and internal reflections that align with the overall aesthetic. The absence of smudging or texture loss implies high-quality digital rendering. Thus, the materials display consistent metallic effects without flaws.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the stylized clouds positioned above the horizon with smooth, flowing outlines and do the window frames show bold, angular lines that align with the architectural style without breaking the window’s structural integrity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized clouds are located above the horizon line and are rendered with smooth, curving outlines that resemble calligraphic or wave-like forms. These lines flow continuously and maintain a cohesive shape, contributing to the decorative aesthetic. The window frames are defined by bold, angular lines with sharp corners and geometric precision, consistent with the art-deco style seen throughout the image. These lines integrate seamlessly with the surrounding architecture, preserving the structural integrity of the windows. There are no breaks or distortions in the frame lines; instead, they follow a deliberate, symmetrical pattern. The combination of flowing cloud forms and rigid window geometry demonstrates a balance between organic and architectural elements, all within the intended stylistic framework.",
    "answer": "Yes"
