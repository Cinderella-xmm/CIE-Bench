      "question": "Does the newly added pastel gown maintain consistent fabric texture and realistic layering without visible seams, pixelation, or unnatural creases?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pastel gown in Image B features a highly detailed design with floral embroidery, lace trim, and layered ruffles. The fabric appears to have a satin-like sheen consistent with historical Rococo-era garments. Upon close inspection, the texture of the fabric is smooth and uniform across the surface, with no visible pixelation or jagged edges that would suggest digital artifacts. The layering of the skirt, particularly the multiple tiers of ruffles, shows natural folds and draping that follow gravity and movement, indicating careful rendering. There are no abrupt seams or unnatural creases; instead, the fabric flows seamlessly from the bodice to the hem. The lighting reflects off the fabric consistently, enhancing the illusion of depth and texture. Based on visual cues and world knowledge of textile rendering in high-quality digital art, the gown appears realistically textured and layered.",

      "question": "Is the powdered wig properly aligned with the head shape and facial features, showing natural volume and no floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The powdered wig in Image B is styled in a manner typical of 18th-century European aristocracy, resembling the elaborate coiffures worn during the Rococo period. It sits atop the subject's head with a structured yet voluminous form, matching the curvature of the skull and hairline. The wig’s base appears to be anchored naturally around the temples and crown, with no visible gaps or floating sections. The curls and puffs extend outward symmetrically, maintaining a balanced silhouette. The lighting highlights the texture of the powder and the individual strands, suggesting a cohesive integration with the head. There are no signs of misalignment or detachment from the scalp, which would indicate poor editing. From a historical and aesthetic standpoint, the wig’s placement and volume are consistent with authentic period styling.",

      "question": "Are the added pearl accessories rendered with consistent lighting and surface reflection, showing no unnatural highlights or ghosting around the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pearl necklace and bracelets in Image B are rendered with spherical shapes and subtle luster, consistent with real pearls. The lighting in the scene comes from overhead chandeliers, casting soft, diffused light that creates gentle highlights on the pearls. These highlights are rounded and evenly distributed, mimicking how light interacts with polished surfaces. There is no over-saturation or unnatural glare that would suggest digital enhancement errors. Additionally, the edges of the pearls are clean and sharp, with no visible ghosting or transparency artifacts that might occur if they were poorly composited. The reflections align with the ambient lighting direction, reinforcing their realism. Given the context of a grand ballroom setting, the pearls appear appropriately integrated into the scene.",

      "question": "Does the edited pose maintain anatomically correct limb positions and joint angles, with no bent fingers, stretched limbs, or impossible body contortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject in Image B is captured mid-twirl, with arms extended gracefully to the sides. The elbows are slightly bent, and the hands are positioned naturally—fingers relaxed and curved, not unnaturally straight or bent. The shoulder alignment is symmetrical, and the torso leans slightly forward, consistent with a dance-like motion. The legs are positioned in a way that suggests one foot is stepping forward while the other supports balance, with knee angles that reflect normal human biomechanics. There are no signs of elongated limbs, disjointed joints, or exaggerated poses that defy anatomy. The overall posture is fluid and dynamic, yet entirely plausible for a person dancing in an elegant gown. This pose aligns with common depictions of formal courtly movements in historical reenactments or period dramas.",

      "question": "Is the background ballroom environment visually consistent with the subject in terms of lighting direction, shadow alignment, and perspective, without obvious blending artifacts or scale distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B depicts a luxurious ballroom with ornate gold detailing, large chandeliers, and reflective wooden floors—characteristic of a French palace like Versailles. The lighting originates from the chandeliers above, casting warm, downward illumination that matches the highlights on the subject’s dress and face. Shadows fall consistently beneath the subject and along the floor, aligning with the light source and creating depth. The perspective is coherent: the floorboards recede toward the vanishing point, and architectural elements like columns and arches maintain proper scaling relative to the figure. There are no visible blending artifacts such as color bleeding or mismatched textures at the edges of the subject. The scale of the room and furniture (e.g., distant tables and figures) appears proportionate to the subject. Overall, the environment integrates seamlessly with the foreground, suggesting a well-composited scene with attention to lighting and spatial consistency.",
