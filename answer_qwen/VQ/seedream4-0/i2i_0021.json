      "question": "Do the chibi-style sheep retain proportional accuracy and structural coherence relative to their original poses near the fence in the image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style sheep are depicted with simplified and stylized features. The proportions of these sheep are not realistic but rather exaggerated for a cute effect, which is typical in chibi art. However, their structural coherence seems maintained as they still resemble sheep standing near a fence. Comparing this to Image A, where the sheep have natural proportions and detailed textures, the chibi version retains a similar pose but lacks proportional accuracy due to artistic style.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the added accessories (red scarf, knit hat, and small bell) free of unnatural textures and logically placed on the chibi sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added accessories like the red scarf, knit hat, and small bell on the chibi sheep appear logically placed and fit well within the context of the image. They do not exhibit unnatural textures; instead, they match the flat color and simple design of the chibi art style. This suggests that the artist has successfully integrated these elements into the overall aesthetic without disrupting the visual harmony.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the thick white outlines and flat colors applied to the chibi sheep create a visually coherent and artifact-free appearance, maintaining their structural integrity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thick white outlines and flat colors used for the chibi sheep create a visually coherent appearance that is characteristic of this art style. There are no visible artifacts or disruptions in the outlines, and the colors are applied evenly, maintaining the structural integrity of each sheep. This approach ensures that the sheep remain distinct and recognizable despite the simplification.",

      "question": "Does the positioning of the chibi sheep near the fence remain visually credible, preserving their original spatial relationship with the environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the chibi sheep near the fence in Image B appears credible and consistent with their original spatial relationship in Image A. The sheep are still depicted as interacting with the fence, preserving the sense of location and environment. The chibi style does not alter this spatial arrangement significantly, ensuring that the viewer can still understand the setting.",

      "question": "Is the background successfully made transparent without visible artifacts or remnants of the snowy landscape affecting the clean appearance of the chibi sheep?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B has been made transparent, and there are no visible remnants of the snowy landscape from Image A affecting the clean appearance of the chibi sheep. The transparency is smooth, and the edges of the sheep are cleanly cut out, indicating a successful editing process that maintains the clarity and focus on the subjects.",
