      "question": "Do the brass gears and leather armor pieces on the character’s torso and limbs have consistent shapes, realistic metallic textures, and proper alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brass gears and leather armor on the character’s torso and limbs in Image B are highly detailed. The metallic components exhibit a consistent golden-brown hue with reflective highlights and subtle surface wear, suggesting realistic metallic textures typical of aged brass. The gear shapes are uniform and follow mechanical design principles—circular with teeth that interlock logically. The leather elements show natural folds and stitching patterns, consistent with high-quality craftsmanship. Alignment between metal plates and leather straps appears precise, with no visible gaps or misaligned edges. These features suggest careful attention to engineering coherence and material realism. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of steampunk aesthetics, where mechanical precision is emphasized, the components appear well-integrated and structurally sound.",

      "question": "Are the clockwork wings symmetrically positioned and structurally coherent, with visible mechanical joints and gear patterns that follow logical engineering principles and do not exhibit warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clockwork wings in Image B are large, ornate, and extend from the character’s back in a symmetrical fashion. Each wing contains multiple interconnected gears of varying sizes, arranged in a radial pattern that mimics natural wing structure while maintaining mechanical functionality. The gear teeth interlock cleanly, and there are visible pivot points and joint mechanisms that suggest articulation. The overall shape of both wings mirrors each other closely, indicating symmetry. There are no apparent distortions, warping, or broken geometries; instead, the construction follows plausible engineering logic seen in steampunk designs. This level of detail aligns with real-world mechanical principles such as gear ratios and structural support, reinforcing the impression of functional, albeit fantastical, machinery.",

      "question": "Is the clock face integrated into the glowing orb clearly visible, properly scaled, and emitting light consistently with the surrounding glow, without distorting the shape or texture of the orb or tendrils?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the glowing orb located at the center of the character's chest contains an embedded clock face. The clock face is clearly visible, with Roman numerals and hands indicating time (approximately 10:10). It is properly scaled relative to the orb and does not appear oversized or cramped. The glow emanating from the orb is warm and golden, consistent with the ambient lighting of the scene. The light appears to originate from within the orb and radiates outward, illuminating the surrounding mechanical tendrils without distorting their shape or texture. The integration of the clock face into the orb is seamless, with no visible clipping or shadowing anomalies. This suggests a deliberate design choice to merge timekeeping with magical or mechanical energy, which is common in steampunk fantasy art.",

      "question": "Does the background cityscape feature detailed brass towers and airships arranged in a spatially plausible layout, with consistent lighting and shadowing under a sepia tone, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background cityscape in Image B depicts a sprawling metropolis dominated by tall, spire-like brass towers with intricate architectural details, including domes and clockwork motifs. These structures are arranged in a layered perspective, creating depth and spatial plausibility. Airships float at various altitudes, appearing anchored to the sky with appropriate scale and positioning relative to the buildings. The lighting is consistent with a sepia-toned atmosphere—warm, diffused, and casting soft shadows that align with the light source (likely overhead). There are no floating or disconnected elements; all structures appear grounded or tethered appropriately. The use of atmospheric haze enhances realism and depth perception. Given the artistic style and genre conventions of steampunk, this arrangement reflects a believable alternate-reality urban environment.",

      "question": "Is the sepia tone applied consistently across the entire image, maintaining visible details in the character’s clothing, mechanical elements, and background without causing fading, discoloration, or loss of contrast in critical areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sepia tone in Image B is uniformly applied throughout the composition, lending a vintage, aged aesthetic characteristic of steampunk imagery. Despite this monochromatic bias, fine details remain visible: the textures of the leather armor, the engravings on brass gears, the stitching on fabric, and the intricate patterns on the wings are all distinguishable. Contrast levels are preserved in key areas—such as the glowing orb, the clock face, and the character’s facial features—ensuring clarity and visual hierarchy. There is no noticeable fading or discoloration that would obscure important elements. The tonal consistency supports the thematic mood without sacrificing legibility or detail, demonstrating effective post-processing balance.",
