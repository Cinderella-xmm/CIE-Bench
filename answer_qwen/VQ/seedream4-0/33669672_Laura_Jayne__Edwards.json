      "question": "Are the limbs proportionally elongated without visible kinks, unnatural bends, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted as a bronze sculpture with stylized, artistic proportions. The limbs appear elongated in a manner consistent with classical or modern sculptural aesthetics, where exaggeration of form is common to convey grace or movement. The arms and legs are smoothly curved, with no visible kinks or breaks in continuity. The joints (elbows, knees) follow natural anatomical angles, albeit slightly exaggerated for stylistic effect. There are no disconnected segments or abrupt bends that would suggest digital distortion or poor rendering. This suggests the elongation is intentional and artistically coherent, not a result of technical flaws.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the geometric patterns on the boots and leg areas uniformly applied with clean edges and no overlapping or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boots in Image B feature intricate geometric patterns composed of triangular and linear designs. These patterns are consistently applied across both boots and extend up the lower leg area. The lines are sharp and evenly spaced, with no visible overlaps or gaps. The symmetry between the two boots is preserved, and the design appears to be seamlessly integrated into the metallic surface, suggesting high-quality digital modeling or sculpting. There is no fragmentation or blurring, indicating uniform application and clean rendering.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all body parts, including the skin, dress, and boots, display a consistent metallic sheen with smooth gradients and no patches of mismatched material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire figure in Image B has a unified bronze-like finish, which is characteristic of a metallic sculpture. The lighting creates smooth gradients across the surface, highlighting contours and depth without abrupt changes in texture or reflectivity. The dress, skin, and boots all share the same reflective quality, suggesting a single material type (bronze). There are no visible patches, seams, or inconsistencies that would indicate mismatched materials. The transitions between body parts are seamless, reinforcing the impression of a cohesive, polished metallic surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the color palette limited to metallic tones and turquoise, with no unexpected color bleed or desaturation in the figure or background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is rendered entirely in shades of bronze and gold, typical of metallic sculptures. The background is a solid turquoise color, providing a strong contrast. There is no evidence of color bleedâ€”no unintended blending of colors from the figure into the background or vice versa. The metallic tones remain saturated and consistent throughout the figure, with no signs of desaturation or discoloration. The base of the sculpture also matches the turquoise hue of the background, maintaining visual harmony without introducing new colors.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the figure's pose maintain natural weight distribution and joint angles, with no floating limbs or unnatural overlaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure is posed dynamically, with one arm extended forward and the other back, and one leg forward while the other trails behind. The stance appears balanced, with the center of gravity likely over the supporting foot. The joint angles at the hips, knees, elbows, and shoulders are anatomically plausible, even if slightly stylized. The legs do not float; they rest firmly on the base, and there are no overlapping limbs that would suggest incorrect spatial positioning. The overall posture conveys motion and balance, consistent with a well-executed sculptural representation.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the extended hand have exactly five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, without extra digits or fused joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The extended hand in Image B shows five distinct fingers, each with proper curvature and spacing. The thumb is positioned appropriately relative to the other fingers, and the phalanges appear proportionate. There are no extra digits, fused joints, or distortions. The hand maintains a natural shape despite the stylized nature of the sculpture. The detail level is sufficient to confirm the presence of five separate fingers with realistic articulation, consistent with human anatomy.",
