      "question": "Does the plush pigeon have a rounded, soft-bodied shape with no visible distortion in limbs or head, and does it maintain a natural posture consistent with a seated stuffed animal?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plush pigeon in Image B exhibits a distinctly soft, rounded form typical of stuffed animals. Its body is plump and lacks sharp angles, suggesting a fabric-based construction. The limbs (legs and feet) are proportionally small and tucked beneath the body, consistent with a seated pose. The head is smooth and spherical, without any unnatural elongation or distortion. The overall posture—slightly tilted forward with balanced weight distribution—mirrors how a stuffed bird might naturally rest on a surface. This appearance aligns with common characteristics of plush toys designed to mimic real animals in a stylized, soft manner. There are no signs of digital warping or anatomical inaccuracies that would suggest distortion.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the blue and gray areas on the plush pigeon’s body evenly colored with soft transitions, and do the feather-like patterns appear as continuous, low-relief designs on fabric rather than sharp, digital lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The coloration of the plush pigeon shows a gradient between blue (on the head and neck) and gray (on the wings and body), with smooth transitions that resemble dye diffusion in fabric rather than abrupt digital segmentation. The texture appears velvety or fuzzy, characteristic of plush materials. The feather-like patterns are not sharply defined but instead rendered as subtle, embossed impressions on the surface—consistent with stitched or printed designs on soft textiles. These patterns lack the crispness of vector graphics or digital rendering artifacts, appearing instead as low-relief textures that would be possible in real-world fabric. This suggests a tactile, handmade quality rather than a digitally drawn one.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the architectural elements (columns, arch, distant buildings) display a uniform, matte surface with visible embossed details that resemble cookie dough or icing, and do they lack shiny reflections or metallic sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The architectural structures in Image B—including the columns, archway, and background buildings—are uniformly textured with a light brown, matte finish reminiscent of baked goods like cookies or gingerbread. The surfaces show raised, embossed patterns such as ornamental swirls and geometric motifs, similar to those found on decorative biscuits. There is no glossy reflection or metallic luster; instead, the lighting interacts with these forms softly, casting gentle shadows that emphasize their three-dimensional relief. This visual treatment strongly suggests a material akin to sugar paste or hardened dough, reinforcing the edible aesthetic. The absence of specular highlights confirms the non-reflective, matte nature of the surfaces.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a wooden shelf beneath the plush pigeon that is flat, horizontally aligned, and has visible wood grain and natural edge wear, with a shadow extending downward and to the right consistent with the sky light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "A horizontal wooden shelf is clearly present beneath the plush pigeon, supporting the cookie-like structure it perches on. The shelf exhibits realistic wood grain patterns running parallel to its length, along with slightly roughened edges that suggest natural wear or handcrafting. It is flat and level, providing stable support. A soft shadow extends from the shelf downward and toward the right side of the image, which aligns with the direction of illumination from the upper-left (as indicated by the bright sky and cloud highlights). This shadow behavior is consistent with ambient daylight coming from above and to the left, casting shadows to the lower-right—a standard lighting convention in 3D rendering and photography. The shadow's softness and placement match the surrounding elements' lighting cues.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all elements in the image (plush pigeon, shelf, cookie structures) share the same lighting direction and shadow behavior, with no overlapping shadows or missing occlusions that suggest inconsistent depth or positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All major elements—the plush pigeon, the shelf, the cookie ball it sits on, and the architectural background—consistently follow a single light source originating from the upper left. Shadows cast by each object fall toward the lower right, maintaining spatial coherence. For example, the pigeon casts a subtle shadow onto the cookie ball, and the cookie ball casts a shadow onto the shelf, both aligned with the same directional logic. The shelf itself casts a shadow below it, and the column behind it also shows consistent shading. There are no contradictory shadows (e.g., one object casting a shadow in one direction while another casts in another), nor are there missing occlusions (such as an object appearing to float without blocking light). Depth relationships are preserved: the pigeon is visually layered over the cookie, which rests on the shelf, and all interact with light and shadow in a unified way. This consistency supports a believable, harmonious scene with coherent lighting.",
