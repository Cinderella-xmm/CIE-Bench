      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image provided (Image B) does not contain any zebras or grassland. Instead, it shows a cross-country skier at a 'START' line in a snowy landscape with trees in the background. There is no evidence of a second zebra or grassland that could have been removed. Therefore, the premise of the question — involving the removal of a zebra and grassland — is based on an incorrect assumption about the content of the image. The scene is entirely consistent with a winter sports environment, featuring snow, ski tracks, poles, and a banner. Since there are no zebras or grassland present, the concept of removing them and evaluating the resulting transition is irrelevant. Hence, the question cannot be meaningfully answered in the context of this image.",
