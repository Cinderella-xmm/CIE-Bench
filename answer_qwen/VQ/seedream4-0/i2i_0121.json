      "question": "Does the character maintain its structural consistency as a chibi version, with no disproportionate or overly exaggerated body parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi style, which typically involves exaggerated proportions such as a larger head relative to the body and simplified features. However, the overall structure remains consistent with chibi conventions: the head is proportionally large, the limbs are short and stubby, and the torso is compact. The arms and legs are appropriately scaled for this art style, and there are no overly distorted or unrealistic proportions that would break the visual logic of a chibi design. The character's body maintains balance and symmetry, adhering to typical chibi aesthetics without introducing unnatural distortions. This suggests that the artist has preserved the structural integrity expected in chibi representations.",

      "question": "Is the shell-shaped base seamlessly integrated with the keychain, avoiding any evident artifacts or unnatural boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows the character standing on a large, shell-shaped object floating on water. There is no visible keychain attached to the character or the shell. The base appears to be a standalone element, possibly stylized as a seashell platform rather than part of a keychain. Since there is no indication of a keychain—such as a ring, chain, or attachment point—the integration of a keychain cannot be evaluated. Therefore, the question about seamless integration with a keychain is based on an assumption not supported by visual evidence. Without a keychain present, the concept of 'seamless integration' does not apply. Thus, the answer must reflect the absence of such an element.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Have the character's facial features retained their distinctiveness in chibi form, without losing important details such as eye shape and mouth expression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s face exhibits classic chibi traits: large, round eyes with prominent pupils, a small nose, and a wide, cheerful smile. Despite the stylization, the eyes retain their characteristic shape—large and expressive—with visible eyelashes and highlights that convey liveliness. The mouth is clearly defined with a stitched scar above it, a signature detail from the original character. These elements are preserved even in the exaggerated chibi form. The facial expression remains joyful and energetic, consistent with the character's personality. Therefore, while the features are simplified, they remain recognizable and faithful to the original design.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character appear naturally positioned on the shell-shaped base, with a logical and stable stance, avoiding any awkward angles or impossible positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B stands upright on the shell-shaped base with both feet firmly planted, maintaining a balanced posture. The legs are slightly apart, providing stability, and the arms are positioned naturally—one raised to adjust the hat, the other relaxed at the side. The center of gravity appears aligned with the base, suggesting a stable stance. The shell itself is broad and flat enough to support the character’s weight without tipping, and the positioning of the feet matches the curvature of the shell logically. There are no bent limbs or unnatural joint angles that would suggest instability or impossibility. The overall composition conveys a sense of equilibrium and natural placement.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the character, including clothing and skin, as well as the shell-shaped base, look natural and cohesive, avoiding any incongruent or artificial surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's skin has a smooth, matte finish typical of anime-style rendering, with subtle shading to indicate form and depth. The clothing—red jacket, yellow sash, blue shorts with white fur trim—is rendered with appropriate texture details: fabric folds, stitching lines, and material differentiation (e.g., the fluffy trim on the shorts). The shell base has a realistic, layered appearance with natural color gradients and surface ridges, resembling a real seashell. The lighting across all elements is consistent, with reflections and shadows matching the direction of the sunlight in the background. There are no visible digital artifacts, pixelation, or mismatched textures. All materials appear cohesive within the artistic style, contributing to a visually harmonious and believable scene.",
