      "question": "Are the LEGO bricks forming the hot dog uniformly shaped, properly aligned, and free of distorted or misshapen pieces that compromise structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO hot dog is constructed using standard-colored LEGO bricks in red, yellow, and tan to mimic a hot dog with mustard. The bricks appear to be uniformly shaped and properly aligned along the length of the structure. Each brick fits into the adjacent ones without visible gaps or misalignments. There are no apparent distortions, such as warped or irregularly shaped bricks, which would disrupt the structural integrity. The overall form maintains a consistent rectangular profile typical of LEGO constructions. This uniformity suggests careful assembly and adherence to LEGO building principles. Based on visual inspection and general knowledge of LEGO design standards, the construction appears solid and well-formed.",

      "question": "Does the ceramic mosaic bottle feature smooth, non-glass-like surfaces with clearly defined geometric patterns in red, yellow, and tan, without unnatural reflections or transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic mosaic bottle in Image B is composed of small, flat tiles arranged in a geometric pattern using red, yellow, and tan colors. These tiles create a tessellated surface that resembles traditional mosaic art. The surface lacks any glass-like sheen or transparency; instead, it has a matte finish typical of ceramic mosaics. There are no unnatural reflections suggesting glossy material, and the edges of the tiles are sharply defined, contributing to a clean, intentional design. The absence of translucency or glare supports the interpretation that this is a solid ceramic object rather than glass. The color distribution and tile alignment are consistent with handcrafted mosaic techniques, reinforcing its authenticity as a non-transparent, non-glossy ceramic piece.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO hot dog's length proportionally consistent with the original hot dog’s size relative to the cutting board and nearby objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "To assess proportionality, we compare the LEGO hot dog in Image B with the original hot dog in Image A. In Image A, the real hot dog appears to be approximately 6–7 inches long, fitting naturally on the wooden cutting board. In Image B, the LEGO hot dog spans a similar length across the same cutting board, maintaining comparable proportions. The spacing between the LEGO bricks and the overall scale suggest that the model is designed to match the physical dimensions of the original. Additionally, the nearby objects (such as the bottle and the edge of the table) remain consistent in size and placement between both images, supporting the conclusion that the LEGO version preserves the original scale. Thus, the LEGO hot dog is proportionally accurate relative to the cutting board and surrounding elements.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the ceramic bottle have a rounded, flowing shape with no sharp angles or blocky geometry that would disrupt visual harmony with the LEGO hot dog?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic mosaic bottle in Image B features a classic vase-like silhouette with a rounded body, a narrow neck, and a slightly flared base. Its form is smooth and curvilinear, lacking any sharp angles or blocky edges. This organic shape contrasts with the angular, modular geometry of the LEGO hot dog but complements it through visual balance—while one is structured and geometric, the other is fluid and artistic. The juxtaposition does not create visual disharmony because the two objects serve different aesthetic roles: the LEGO hot dog as playful, mechanical representation, and the mosaic bottle as an ornamental, handcrafted piece. Therefore, the bottle’s rounded form enhances rather than disrupts the scene’s composition.",

      "question": "Is the wooden base under both the LEGO hot dog and ceramic bottle seamless, with consistent wood grain and color matching the surrounding table surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base in Image B appears to be a single, continuous cutting board placed on a larger wooden table. The wood grain runs consistently across the board and blends seamlessly with the table surface beneath it. There are no visible seams, cracks, or color discrepancies that would suggest mismatched materials or digital editing artifacts. The texture and tone of the wood are uniform, indicating a cohesive design choice. Furthermore, the lighting highlights natural wood patterns without introducing unnatural shadows or highlights that might imply compositing errors. The integration of the base with the surrounding environment is smooth and realistic, suggesting careful attention to material continuity and environmental consistency.",
