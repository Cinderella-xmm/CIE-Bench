      "question": "Is the text 'Stories Through Time' rendered in a serif font with a distressed gold texture that matches the typewriter’s material and color tone, and does it appear seamlessly integrated into the image without overlapping or obscuring key objects like the typewriter or lamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Stories Through Time' in Image B is rendered with a serif font that has a distressed gold texture. This matches the vintage aesthetic of the typewriter and the overall sepia tone of the image. The placement of the text does not overlap or obscure key objects like the typewriter or lamp, as it is positioned on the side of the typewriter where there is sufficient space. The integration appears seamless, maintaining the visual harmony of the scene.",
