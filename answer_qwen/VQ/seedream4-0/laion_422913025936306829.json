      "question": "Are the color blocks applied across the shirt’s surface uniform and sharply defined, with no visible smudging or blending between adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The image shows a t-shirt with a design that appears to be derived from a vibrant mural. The design on the shirt uses a dark base color (likely navy blue or black) with gold or bronze outlines forming intricate patterns. However, upon close inspection, the color blocks on the shirt are not uniformly filled; instead, they appear as line art with minimal solid fill, suggesting that the design is primarily outlined rather than filled with solid colors. There is no evidence of smudging or blending in the way the lines are rendered, but since the design relies heavily on outlines and lacks filled-in color blocks, the concept of 'uniformly filled' color blocks does not apply here. Therefore, the answer hinges on whether 'color blocks' refers to solid fills or just the boundaries of shapes. Given the nature of the design—where color is mostly implied through line work—the color blocks are not filled in a traditional sense, so they cannot be considered 'uniform and sharply defined' in terms of solid color application. This leads to the conclusion that the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Do the neon-colored patterns repeat consistently across the shirt, maintaining symmetry and alignment with the original layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt's design features a stylized figure surrounded by geometric and ornamental patterns. However, the design on the shirt is not rendered in neon colors—it uses gold/bronze outlines on a dark background, lacking the vivid, high-contrast neon hues seen in the original mural. Moreover, the pattern on the shirt appears simplified and condensed compared to the full mural, which includes complex, multi-colored sections and symmetrical elements. Due to the reduction in scale and the shift from a large-scale mural to a small-format garment, the symmetry and repetition of patterns are compromised. The shirt’s design omits many of the detailed, repeating motifs present in the original artwork, and the alignment of the central figure and surrounding geometry is altered to fit the T-shirt’s shape. Thus, the neon-colored patterns do not repeat consistently or maintain symmetry when transferred to the shirt. The absence of neon colors and the simplification of the design further support this conclusion.",

      "question": "Are the limbs and torso of the central figure proportionally accurate, with no exaggerated or broken joint lines that violate physical realism?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure on the shirt is depicted in a dynamic pose, kneeling with one arm raised. The proportions of the limbs and torso appear stylized rather than anatomically precise. The figure’s arms and legs are elongated, and the joints (such as elbows and knees) are emphasized with sharp angles and decorative lines, which deviate from natural human anatomy. These stylistic choices suggest an artistic interpretation rather than a realistic portrayal. Additionally, the use of angular, geometric forms in the limbs and torso creates a sense of distortion, especially at the joints, where lines converge in ways that do not reflect real musculature or bone structure. While the figure is coherent within the artistic style, it does not adhere to physical realism. Therefore, the limbs and torso are not proportionally accurate in a realistic sense.",

      "question": "Are the fine details such as facial features, hair texture, and ornamental lines clearly visible and unbroken in the edited version?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The design on the shirt includes outlines of facial features, hair, and ornamental patterns, but due to the reduced scale and the use of thin lines, some details are less distinct. The facial features—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—are present but simplified, with minimal shading or depth. Hair texture is represented through flowing lines, but the finer strands are not individually distinguishable. Ornamental lines around the figure and in the background are continuous but appear slightly blurred or softened, possibly due to printing limitations or resolution constraints. In comparison to the original mural, which displays crisp, high-definition lines and clear textures, the shirt version sacrifices detail for scalability. As a result, while the general form is preserved, the fine details are not as clearly visible or unbroken as in the original. Hence, the answer is 'No'.",

      "question": "Is the central figure properly aligned within the circular frame, with no misalignment or distortion of the bordering geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central figure on the shirt is positioned within a circular frame composed of geometric and floral patterns. However, due to the rectangular format of the T-shirt and the need to adapt the circular composition to a flat surface, there is noticeable distortion. The circular frame appears stretched vertically, particularly around the top and bottom edges, which disrupts the symmetry of the original design. The geometric shapes surrounding the figure—such as triangles, stars, and floral motifs—are also compressed or skewed to fit the shirt’s dimensions. This results in misalignment of the bordering elements relative to the central figure. In contrast, the original mural maintains perfect circular symmetry and precise alignment of all components. The adaptation to the shirt format introduces distortions that compromise the integrity of the circular frame and its surrounding patterns. Therefore, the alignment is not preserved.",
