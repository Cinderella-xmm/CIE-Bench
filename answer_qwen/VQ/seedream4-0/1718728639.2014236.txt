    "Question": "Q1: Do the tesserae on the chest and torso follow the original armor’s curves without visible breaks, misalignments, or inconsistent tile sizes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure's chest and torso are rendered in a mosaic style composed of small, square tesserae. The tiles appear to be carefully arranged to conform to the underlying curvature of the armor, which includes rounded breastplate sections and sculpted contours along the abdomen. The tesserae maintain consistent size and shape across the surface, with no obvious gaps, overlaps, or irregularities. The lines between tiles follow the natural flow of the armor's design, suggesting that the artist has preserved the original form while translating it into mosaic form. This alignment is achieved through precise placement of tiles that respect the three-dimensional structure of the armor. Given the high level of detail and uniformity in tile application, there are no visible breaks or misalignments. The curvature is accurately represented, indicating a faithful adaptation of the original form into mosaic art.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the left and right wings symmetrically styled with ornate feathers, and do they maintain natural layering and curvature without unnatural bends or gaps?",
    "explanation": "The wings in Image B are depicted as large, expansive structures made of mosaic tiles forming feather-like patterns. Both wings exhibit a high degree of symmetry in their overall shape and arrangement of feathers. Each wing features layered segments that mimic the natural overlapping of real feathers, with the mosaic tiles following these layers closely. The curvature of the wings appears organic and balanced, with no visible distortions or unnatural bends. The feathers on both sides mirror each other in size, spacing, and orientation, suggesting careful design to achieve bilateral symmetry. Furthermore, the transition between tiles within the feathers is seamless, with no gaps or abrupt shifts in pattern. This consistency indicates that the artist maintained both aesthetic harmony and structural realism in translating the wing design into mosaic form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the celestial dome background appear to surround the figure without visible edges, color bleeding, or inconsistencies in lighting direction?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B features a celestial dome composed of mosaic tiles, with a radiant halo behind the figure’s head and a starry night sky extending outward. The dome appears to seamlessly encircle the figure, with no sharp edges or interruptions in the tiling pattern. The transition from the golden halo to the deep blue starfield is smooth, using gradient-like arrangements of tiles that suggest depth and continuity. There is no evidence of color bleeding—each tile maintains its distinct hue, and the boundaries between colors are clean and intentional. Lighting appears consistent, with the glow emanating from the central halo casting subtle highlights on the surrounding tiles, creating a sense of illumination from within. The directional light seems to originate from the center, enhancing the divine or sacred atmosphere. This coherence in lighting and composition suggests a well-executed integration of the figure into the celestial backdrop, with no visual artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the mosaic patterns on the crown and neckpiece aligned with the original shape, symmetrically placed, and free of distorted or missing sections?",
    "explanation": "The crown and neckpiece in Image B are intricately detailed with mosaic tiles that replicate the original ornamental design. The crown retains its symmetrical structure, with mirrored elements on both sides, including angular motifs and central gem-like details. The tiles are uniformly sized and precisely aligned to follow the contours of the original metalwork, preserving the intended geometry. Similarly, the neckpiece features a high collar with decorative ridges and flowing lines, all faithfully reconstructed in mosaic form. There are no visible distortions, such as stretched or warped tiles, nor are there any missing sections—every part of the design is filled with appropriate tesserae. The symmetry is maintained across both halves, and the transitions between different parts of the crown and neckpiece are smooth and continuous. This indicates a meticulous adherence to the original shape and proportional accuracy in the mosaic adaptation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the gold and azure colors used consistently across the armor, wings, and crown, with matching reflectivity and no abrupt transitions between materials?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the color palette is dominated by gold and azure tones, which are applied consistently across the entire figure. The gold is used for structural elements like the crown, wing outlines, and armor trim, while azure accents highlight decorative patterns and background elements. The reflectivity of the gold tiles appears uniform, with a metallic sheen that mimics polished metal, and this quality is maintained across all gold surfaces, including the wings, crown, and armor. The azure tiles also show consistent saturation and brightness, contributing to a harmonious visual balance. Transitions between gold and azure areas are smooth, with no abrupt changes in tone or texture—this is achieved through careful selection of tile colors and placement. The mosaic technique allows for gradual blending where needed, especially in curved or shaded areas. Overall, the materials appear cohesive, with no visual dissonance between different parts of the figure, indicating a deliberate and skillful use of color and material simulation in the mosaic style.",
    "answer": "Yes"
