      "question": "Do the transformed peaks retain their original height and angularity without appearing stretched, bent, or misaligned compared to the base of the mountains?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 'peaks' are no longer geological formations but have been transformed into a fantastical creature resembling a bull-like entity with rocky, moss-covered skin. The visual structure suggests that the original mountain peaks have been reinterpreted as parts of this creature's back and head. The angularity and height of the original peaks are not preserved; instead, they appear morphed into the curved, organic forms of the creature’s body. The horns align roughly with the former peak positions, but the overall shape is now biologically inspired rather than geologically accurate. This transformation involves significant warping and reshaping, making the peaks appear bent and misaligned relative to the base terrain. Therefore, the original height and angularity are not retained.",

      "question": "Are the textured hide patterns on the mountain slopes smooth and consistent with natural rock formations, without repeating tile-like patterns or sharp edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the creature’s hide in Image B features a complex interplay of stone-like surfaces, moss, and root-like structures. While these elements resemble natural rock formations at first glance, closer inspection reveals inconsistencies such as repetitive patterns in the moss distribution and unnaturally uniform root networks that suggest digital manipulation. The surface lacks the random irregularities typical of real rock faces and instead displays a structured, almost manufactured appearance. Additionally, some areas show sharp transitions between textures, which are not characteristic of natural erosion or biological growth. These cues indicate the presence of digital artifacts, particularly in how the textures are applied across the creature’s body.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the mossy patches and root-like strands extend naturally from existing vegetation zones and follow downhill gradients without floating above the ground or forming unnatural clusters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the moss and root-like strands are integrated into the creature’s body, appearing to grow from its back and sides. While some of these elements follow the general slope of the animal’s form, many seem to float or project outward in ways inconsistent with gravity or natural plant growth. For example, certain roots extend horizontally or upward, defying typical downhill flow. Moreover, the clustering of moss appears dense and uniform in places, lacking the patchy, variable distribution seen in real ecosystems. These anomalies suggest that the placement of moss and roots was artistically stylized rather than ecologically grounded, resulting in an unnatural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the sinewy musculature in the valley area follow the natural curve of the depression and connect smoothly to adjacent slopes without creating disjointed or exaggerated protrusions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The valley region in Image B has been transformed into what appears to be the lower limbs and torso of the creature. The 'musculature' here is highly stylized, with exaggerated bulges and deep grooves that do not correspond to realistic anatomy or natural topography. Instead of flowing seamlessly with the surrounding terrain, these features create abrupt changes in elevation and form, suggesting artificial sculpting. The connection between the 'legs' and the rest of the body is uneven, with visible seams and disproportionate scaling. This indicates that the musculature does not follow the natural curvature of the original valley but rather imposes a fantastical, biomechanical design upon it, leading to disjointed and overemphasized protrusions.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the transformed elements (hide, fur, musculature) within the same tonal range as the original landscape, with no sudden shifts in hue or brightness that disrupt visual coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of the transformed creature in Image B includes earthy browns, grays, and muted greens—colors that broadly match the original mountainous environment shown in Image A. However, there are subtle but noticeable differences: the creature’s hide has a slightly darker, more saturated tone than the surrounding terrain, especially around the joints and underbelly, where shadows are deeper than would be expected under diffuse lighting. Additionally, the moss appears more vivid and uniformly green, contrasting with the duller, patchier vegetation in the background. These discrepancies, while not extreme, introduce slight tonal shifts that break visual continuity. Despite this, the overall harmony remains relatively intact due to shared earth tones. Nevertheless, the localized intensity variations suggest some degree of artificial enhancement.",

      "question": "Are small-scale details like erosion lines, grass tufts, and rock crevices still visible and correctly aligned with the terrain, without blurring, duplication, or unnatural smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of Image B, the small-scale details such as erosion lines and grass tufts are largely absent or heavily stylized. Where present, they appear simplified or duplicated, particularly along the creature’s flanks and legs, where repeated patterns of cracks and textures suggest digital rendering rather than natural formation. The transition between different surface types (e.g., rock vs. fur) is often blurred or overly smooth, lacking the fine granularity seen in real landscapes. Furthermore, grass tufts are sparse and inconsistently placed, sometimes appearing as isolated clumps without rooting in the soil. These issues indicate that micro-details have been compromised during the transformation process, resulting in a loss of realism and alignment with the terrain.",
