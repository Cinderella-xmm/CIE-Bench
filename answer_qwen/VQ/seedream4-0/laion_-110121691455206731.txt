    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the watch has been anthropomorphized with facial features. The eyes and mouth are positioned on the dial in a way that they do not obscure the numerals or subdials. They appear to be integrated into the metallic texture of the watch face without introducing unnatural shading or edges. This is evident from the smooth blending of the features with the existing design elements of the watch.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The detective desk and magnifying glass in Image B are proportionally sized relative to the watch, maintaining a consistent comic style with uniform line weight and shading.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The background elements in Image B, such as the cluttered office items, are spatially coherent with the watch.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The tick mark sound effects around the dial in Image B are uniformly shaped and cleanly rendered. They do not have jagged edges, smudging, or inconsistent spacing.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The stylized version in Image B retains the original texture of the black leather strap and the brushed silver finish of the case.

    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The hour and minute hands, subdials, and date window in Image B are preserved in their original positions and proportions.
