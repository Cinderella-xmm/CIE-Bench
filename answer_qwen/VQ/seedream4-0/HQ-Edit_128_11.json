      "question": "Does the enhanced chandelier retain its symmetrical structure and realistic crystal texture, with no visible distortion or irregularities in its shape or lighting reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chandelier is centrally positioned beneath the ornate ceiling dome. Its structure appears symmetrically balanced, with evenly spaced candle-like lights and a cascading crystal design that mimics traditional crystal chandeliers. The lighting reflects off the crystals in a way that suggests depth and realism, consistent with how light interacts with glass surfaces. There are no obvious distortions—such as warped arms or uneven spacing of elements—and the glow from the candles is soft and diffuse, contributing to a natural appearance. The symmetry is preserved, and the reflection patterns on the crystals are coherent with the light source above. Based on visual inspection and common knowledge about chandelier design and lighting physics, the chandelier maintains structural integrity and plausible material representation.",

      "question": "Are the newly added patterns on the ceiling consistent in style and scale with the existing decorative elements, and do they blend seamlessly without creating visual breaks or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceiling in Image B features a sepia-toned treatment that gives it an aged, vintage appearance. While there are intricate circular designs around the central medallion, these appear to be part of the original architectural motif rather than newly added patterns. However, due to the monochromatic filter and textural overlay, the fine details are softened and somewhat obscured. Upon close examination, there is no clear evidence of abruptly introduced patterns that clash with the surrounding ornamentation. The radial symmetry and decorative motifs seem harmonious with classical theater architecture. The transition between areas is smooth, with no sharp edges or disjointed elements suggesting artificial additions. Given the uniform tone and subtle detailing, any patterns present appear integrated into the overall design. Therefore, based on visual continuity and stylistic coherence, the ceiling elements appear consistent and well-blended.",

      "question": "Do the silhouette figures in the audience retain recognizable human postures and relative spacing, avoiding unnatural clustering or elongation that would compromise spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the audience is rendered as silhouettes, primarily visible along the front rows and in the balcony levels. These figures maintain general human proportions and seated postures, such as upright backs and angled legs, which align with typical concert attendance behavior. The spacing between individuals is relatively even, though slightly compressed due to the artistic stylization. There is no evident elongation or distortion of limbs, nor are there clusters that violate physical plausibility. The use of silhouettes abstracts detail but preserves basic spatial relationships—people are arranged in rows, facing the stage, with appropriate depth cues. While not anatomically detailed, the silhouettes adhere to logical groupings and perspective, maintaining spatial coherence. Thus, despite the stylistic simplification, the human forms remain recognizable and spatially plausible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the sepia tone evenly applied across all surfaces, maintaining visible texture differences between materials such as the wooden floor, piano finish, and gilded ceiling, without introducing muddy or oversaturated areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a sepia filter that uniformly casts a warm, golden-brown hue over the entire scene. Despite this tonal shift, distinct textures remain discernible: the polished wood grain of the floor shows variation in shading and reflectivity; the glossy black surface of the piano retains a slight sheen indicative of lacquer; and the gilded ceiling exhibits raised decorative elements with subtle highlights. The sepia tone does not flatten the image into a single value—it preserves contrast through careful gradient application. There are no regions where the tone becomes overly saturated or muddy, especially in shadowed areas like under the piano or in the back rows. Instead, the texture differences are subtly emphasized by the tonal layering, enhancing the vintage aesthetic without obscuring material distinctions. This suggests a controlled and intentional application of the filter.",

      "question": "Is the grand piano centered correctly on the stage with accurate perspective, intact legs, and natural shadowing that matches the light source from above, without any deformation or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grand piano in Image B is positioned centrally on the stage, aligned with the vanishing point of the converging floor lines, indicating correct perspective. All four legs are fully visible and proportionally intact, with no signs of cropping or distortion. The shadow beneath the piano is cast directly downward and slightly forward, consistent with overhead lighting from the chandelier. The shadow's shape and soft edges match the piano’s form and suggest a single dominant light source from above. There is no floating effect—the piano rests firmly on the floor, with visible contact points at each leg. The overall composition respects geometric principles of foreshortening and lighting direction. Compared to standard concert hall staging, the placement is both realistic and artistically balanced.",

      "question": "Is the text “AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY” clearly visible at the top of the image, properly aligned within the frame, and rendered with crisp edges and consistent stroke weight, without interfering with background details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'AN EVENING OF CLASSICAL MAJESTY' is located at the top center of Image B, occupying a prominent position without overlapping critical visual elements like the chandelier or ceiling artwork. It is rendered in a serif font with clean, sharp edges and uniform stroke weight, ensuring readability against the textured background. The color of the text contrasts sufficiently with the lighter sepia tones behind it, allowing for clear visibility. There is no blurring, feathering, or jaggedness in the letterforms, and the alignment is horizontal and centered. Importantly, the text does not obscure key features of the ceiling design, and its placement enhances the poster-like quality of the image without visual interference. The integration of typography into the composition is professional and aesthetically appropriate.",
