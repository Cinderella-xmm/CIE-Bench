      "question": "Does the replaced area where the mirror used to be show natural fabric canvas texture consistent with the wall art's minimalist style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the area previously occupied by a mirror now features a rectangular piece of wall art that appears to be made from a textured fabric canvas. The surface has a visible weave pattern and slight irregularities typical of natural fabric materials such as linen or cotton canvas. This texture is consistent with minimalist aesthetic principles, which often emphasize natural materials and understated craftsmanship. The texture does not appear digitally altered or overly smooth, suggesting authenticity in material representation. Given the context of minimalist design—where tactile quality and simplicity are valued—the presence of this natural fabric texture aligns well with the intended style of the artwork.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the minimalist landscape wall art placed at the same level as the original mirror's frame, ensuring no distortion or inconsistency in its placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "By comparing the positioning of the wall art in Image B to the mirror in Image A, it is evident that both objects occupy the same central vertical space on the wall above the sink. The top edge of the wall art aligns with the top edge of the original mirror frame, and the width matches closely, indicating careful alignment. There is no apparent shift in height or tilt, and the surrounding lighting fixtures remain symmetrical relative to the new artwork. This suggests that the replacement was executed with attention to spatial consistency, preserving the original layout’s balance. In interior design, maintaining consistent fixture placement ensures visual harmony; thus, the alignment here supports structural coherence.",

      "question": "Does the minimalist landscape wall art maintain the room's structural coherence, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or disproportionate spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall art is a rectangular piece with clean, straight edges that match the geometry of the surrounding environment—particularly the square marble tiles and the linear form of the wooden vanity. Its proportions (width-to-height ratio) appear balanced relative to the sink and the overall wall composition. There are no jagged lines, misaligned corners, or uneven gaps around the artwork, which could disrupt the room’s symmetry. Additionally, the artwork’s placement maintains equal spacing from the adjacent light fixtures and the sink below, reinforcing a sense of order. In architectural and interior design, maintaining proportional relationships between elements is crucial for visual stability; therefore, the artwork contributes positively to the room’s structural integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any visible unnatural textures or artifacts on the fabric canvas material of the minimalist landscape wall art?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the fabric canvas in Image B, the surface displays a uniform weave pattern with subtle variations in thread density, characteristic of real textile materials. There are no pixelation, blurring, or repeating patterns that would suggest digital manipulation or artifacting. The shading across the canvas is soft and gradual, particularly in the mountain silhouette, which blends naturally into the background without sharp transitions or halos. These qualities indicate a high-quality rendering or photograph of an actual physical object rather than a synthetic or poorly edited image. In digital imaging, artifacts often manifest as unnatural edges or inconsistent lighting; none of these are present here.",

      "question": "Does the color scheme and style of the minimalist landscape wall art blend naturally with the bathroom’s white marble tiles and wooden vanity, without looking out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall art features a muted palette of off-white and soft gray tones, depicting a minimalist mountain landscape. This color scheme harmonizes with the white marble tiles, which have subtle gray veining, creating a cohesive visual flow. The warm brown tones of the wooden vanity provide a complementary contrast that enhances the calm, neutral atmosphere. The minimalist style of the artwork—characterized by simplicity, negative space, and understated imagery—matches the modern, uncluttered aesthetic of the bathroom. Such integration reflects good interior design practice, where decorative elements should complement rather than dominate the space. Therefore, the artwork fits seamlessly within the environment.",
