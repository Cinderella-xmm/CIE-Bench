      "question": "Are the enchanted vines covering the Eiffel Tower's lattice continuous and aligned with its original structural lines, without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted with glowing vines that wrap around its structure. These vines appear to follow the general curvature and angles of the tower’s iron lattice, suggesting an attempt to align with its original architectural lines. The vines are rendered with a consistent thickness and smooth continuity, showing no abrupt breaks or jagged edges. They wind in a naturalistic way around the beams, maintaining visual harmony with the tower’s geometry. This alignment reflects both artistic intent and a degree of structural fidelity, even though the vines are fantastical elements. There is no visible inconsistency in thickness or discontinuity, indicating a high level of detail in the rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glowing floral motifs emit light uniformly and cast soft glows that match the ambient lighting from the sunset, without abrupt brightness spikes or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral motifs on the vines in Image B are illuminated with a warm, golden glow that appears consistent across the structure. Each flower emits light softly, contributing to an overall luminous effect that complements the ambient lighting of the twilight sky. The glow blends well with the surrounding environment, particularly the orange and purple hues of the sunset near the horizon. There are no harsh brightness spikes or isolated highlights that stand out unnaturally; instead, the illumination has a diffuse quality, suggesting a carefully balanced lighting design. The glow enhances the magical atmosphere without disrupting the scene’s visual coherence.",

      "question": "Is the ancient stone platform at the base of the tower proportionally scaled to the tower's legs and positioned symmetrically, without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone platform beneath the Eiffel Tower in Image B is clearly designed as a circular structure with concentric patterns. It is centered directly under the tower’s base, which is symmetrical and evenly spaced between the four legs of the tower. The platform appears to be proportionally sized relative to the tower—large enough to support the structure but not so large as to dominate it. There is no visible warping or distortion in the platform’s shape, and the symmetry is maintained from all visible angles. The steps leading up to the tower are also aligned properly, reinforcing the sense of balance and architectural integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the arcane symbols on the stone platform evenly spaced, properly oriented, and rendered with depth and shadowing that suggest they are carved into the stone?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone platform in Image B features intricate geometric and symbolic patterns that resemble arcane or alchemical sigils. These symbols are evenly distributed across the surface in a radial pattern, suggesting deliberate design and symmetry. Each symbol is rendered with clear outlines and subtle shading that creates a sense of depth, implying they are carved into the stone rather than painted or projected. The shadows fall consistently with the light source (from above and slightly behind), enhancing the three-dimensional appearance. There is no evidence of misalignment or irregular spacing, and the orientation of each symbol follows the circular layout logically.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the swirling nebulae in the sky flow smoothly from the tower’s base upward, blending with the orange gradient without sharp edges or disconnected patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sky in Image B transitions from a vibrant orange near the horizon to deep purples and blues higher up, with swirling nebulae that appear to emanate from the area around the tower. However, upon closer inspection, the nebulae do not seamlessly blend with the orange gradient at the lower part of the sky. Instead, there is a noticeable boundary where the cosmic clouds meet the terrestrial sunset hues, creating a somewhat artificial separation. While the nebulae themselves are smooth and fluid in their internal structure, they do not fully integrate with the orange layer below, resulting in a slight disconnection. This suggests a digital composite effect rather than a natural atmospheric transition.",

      "question": "Does the crystal pinnacle at the top of the tower have distinct, reflective facets that catch the sunlight and show subtle refractions, without appearing blurry or geometrically distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the apex of the tower in Image B, there is a large, multifaceted crystal that serves as a magical crown. The crystal displays clear, sharp facets that reflect light in multiple directions, producing bright highlights and subtle internal refractions. These reflections are consistent with how light interacts with transparent, polished gemstones. The geometry of the crystal is precise and symmetrical, with no signs of blurring or distortion. The way it catches the ambient light from the surrounding sky enhances its realism and mystical quality, suggesting careful attention to optical physics in the rendering process.",
