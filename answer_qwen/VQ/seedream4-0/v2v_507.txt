    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi tech mascot maintain the original phone's color scheme and design elements without introducing unnatural textures or colors?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi tech mascot is designed with a pinkish hue that closely matches the color of the phone shown in both images. The phone itself has a matte rose-gold or dusty pink finish, which is consistently reflected in the mascot’s body, clothing, and accessories. The camera module on the phone is preserved as part of the mascot’s head, maintaining its shape and placement, which suggests a deliberate design choice to integrate the phone’s features into the character. There are no visible unnatural textures or colors—everything uses smooth, uniform shading typical of 3D-rendered characters. The use of consistent tones across the phone and the mascot indicates a coherent aesthetic strategy, leveraging the phone’s original design elements (like the dual-camera bump) as facial features. This integration respects the original product’s visual identity while transforming it into a stylized character. Therefore, the color scheme and core design elements are maintained without introducing artificial or discordant visual aspects.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the elongated legs of the chibi tech mascot proportionally correct and structurally consistent with the rest of the body, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
    "explanation": "The chibi tech mascot features exaggeratedly long legs relative to its torso and head, which is a common stylistic trait in chibi or cartoonish character designs. While the proportions are not anatomically accurate, they are consistent with the artistic style intended for playful, whimsical representation. The legs are cylindrical and smoothly shaped, tapering slightly toward the feet, which maintains structural coherence within the design language. They connect seamlessly to the body and support the character’s upright posture without visible warping or geometric anomalies. Although the elongation is intentional for comedic or stylistic effect, it does not introduce distortion or break the visual logic of the model. In this context, 'proportional correctness' should be interpreted as consistency within the chosen art style rather than real-world anatomy. Thus, the legs are structurally sound within the design framework.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the outfit and accessories of the chibi tech mascot, including glasses, sneakers, and gadgets, retain fine details and appear natural without any visible artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The mascot wears black-framed glasses, a short-sleeved shirt with a badge, white sneakers with pink soles, and holds a tablet and stylus. Each accessory is rendered with clean lines and subtle shading, indicating high-quality 3D modeling. The glasses have realistic reflections and proper curvature, and the sneakers show distinct laces and sole layers. The badge on the shirt includes a small logo ('Q') with clear edges and appropriate depth. The tablet and stylus are simple but well-defined, matching the minimalist aesthetic. There are no visible rendering artifacts such as jagged edges, texture misalignments, or lighting inconsistencies. All elements appear cohesive and polished, suggesting professional digital artistry. Given the stylized nature of the character, the level of detail is sufficient and visually plausible. No unnatural distortions or flaws are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the breakdown of individual clothing pieces and accessories in the right section visually plausible and consistent with the full-body illustration in the left section, without any distortion or inconsistency?",
    "explanation": "On the right side of Image B, three separate components are displayed: the phone (as the base), the shirt, and the shirt with added accessories. These components align with the full-body character on the left. The shirt shown separately matches the one worn by the mascot in terms of color, cut, and the placement of the badge. The addition of a horizontal stripe and stylus in the lower version corresponds to how these items are integrated in the full figure. The phone image above matches the head/upper body of the mascot exactly, confirming that the phone is used as the character’s face. There is no mismatch in scale, color, or form between the parts and the whole. The layout implies a modular design approach, where each element can be swapped or viewed independently. This decomposition is logically consistent and enhances understanding of the character’s construction. No distortions or discrepancies are evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the solid background color complement the phone's aesthetic and enhance the overall visual quality without introducing any unnatural or distracting elements?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B is a neutral, light beige tone that provides a clean, unobtrusive backdrop for the character and product display. This color choice avoids clashing with the pink hues of the phone and mascot, ensuring visual harmony. It also emphasizes the subject without drawing attention away from it, which is typical in product-focused illustrations. The absence of patterns, gradients, or shadows beyond those necessary for depth suggests a minimalist design intent. This simplicity enhances clarity and professionalism, making the image suitable for marketing or branding contexts. The background does not introduce any unnatural elements—no texture mismatches, lighting inconsistencies, or visual noise. Its neutrality supports the aesthetic of the phone and mascot, reinforcing a modern, sleek look. Therefore, it complements the overall design effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"
