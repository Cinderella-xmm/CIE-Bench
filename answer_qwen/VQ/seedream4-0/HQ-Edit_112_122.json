      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the dress clearly defined, proportionally consistent with the garment’s scale, and free from jagged edges or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dress worn by the woman is a strapless gown with a red upper portion and a deep blue lower skirt. Upon close inspection, there are no visible floral patterns directly on the fabric of the dress itself. The design relies on solid color blocks and subtle shading to suggest volume and movement rather than intricate surface patterns. Since there are no floral motifs present on the dress, the question about their clarity, proportionality, or artifact-free rendering becomes moot. In the absence of such patterns, we cannot assess them for definition or consistency. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common understanding of garment design in digital art, where patterns would typically be integrated into the texture if intended, the lack of any such detail implies that the dress does not feature floral patterns at all. Thus, the condition regarding floral patterns being clearly defined and free from artifacts cannot be met because they do not exist.",

      "question": "Does the lighting from the top right cast soft gradients on the woman’s face, dress, and nearby flowers without causing unnatural overexposure or disconnected highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, a bright light source is visible in the top-right corner, suggesting sunlight streaming through an open sky. This light casts a warm glow across the scene, particularly illuminating the woman's left side (from the viewer's perspective), her hair, and parts of her dress. The gradient on her face transitions smoothly from lit areas to shadowed ones, with soft transitions that mimic natural lighting. Her cheekbones and jawline show gentle highlights, consistent with directional lighting. The dress also reflects this illumination, with the red fabric appearing brighter on the illuminated side and gradually darkening toward the shadowed regions. Nearby flowers, especially those on the right side, are highlighted with warm tones, but no harsh white spots or blown-out pixels are evident. There are no disconnected highlights—each bright area logically connects to the light source. This suggests careful use of lighting techniques typical in digital illustration to simulate realistic ambient occlusion and diffuse reflection. Compared to real-world lighting behavior, this setup appears plausible and artistically coherent. Therefore, the lighting achieves soft gradients without overexposure or artificial-looking highlights.",

      "question": "Are the floating petals distributed evenly in mid-air, showing natural dispersion and depth, with no clustered or floating-in-place anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, numerous pink petals are seen floating around the woman, particularly near her arms and lower dress. These petals vary slightly in size and orientation, suggesting motion through air. They appear to be drifting downward or sideways, consistent with gravity and airflow dynamics. The distribution is not uniform but follows a pattern that mimics wind currents—more concentrated near the woman’s hands and dispersing outward. Some petals are closer to the foreground while others appear fainter in the background, indicating depth perception. There are no clumps or clusters that defy physics, nor do any petals seem frozen in place as if stuck in midair. Instead, their arrangement gives the impression of gentle, continuous motion, supported by the slight blur effect on some petals, which enhances the sense of movement. From a visual standpoint, this matches expectations of how lightweight objects like flower petals behave in a breeze. Thus, the petal distribution demonstrates natural dispersion and depth cues.",

      "question": "Do the floral vines forming the writing area extend naturally from surrounding plants, maintaining consistent thickness, color, and growth direction without abrupt starts or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central area features a blank space resembling a notebook page, framed by large flowers and green vines. These vines originate from the bottom-left and top-right corners and curve inward to form an arch-like border. The vines are composed of green stems with leaves and small blossoms, blending seamlessly with the surrounding flora. The thickness of the vines remains relatively constant along their length, and their color is consistent with typical plant pigmentation—variations in green shade suggest shading due to light, not irregularity. Growth direction follows natural botanical patterns: curving upward and outward from the base, then looping inward to frame the center. There are no sudden starts or breaks; each vine appears to grow organically from existing plants. For example, the vine on the left begins among smaller flowers and continues upward into larger blooms, maintaining continuity. Similarly, the right-side vine emerges from yellow flowers below and extends into a giant pink bloom above. This integration with the environment and smooth progression support the conclusion that the vines are designed to look natural and cohesive within the scene.",

      "question": "Does the woman’s left hand show five distinct fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and does the hand appear attached correctly to the arm without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman’s left hand is extended outward, palm facing down, with the fingers slightly spread. Upon close examination, all five fingers are visible: thumb, index, middle, ring, and little finger. Each finger has a clear shape with natural curvature and proportional spacing between them. The joints are subtly defined, contributing to a lifelike appearance. The hand is connected smoothly to the forearm, with no visible distortions such as extra limbs, missing segments, or unnatural angles. The wrist aligns properly with the arm, and the overall posture of the hand matches the dynamic pose of the figure. While stylized, the hand adheres to anatomical norms expected in character design, especially in illustrated forms. There are no signs of digital artifacts or warping. Given these observations and general knowledge of human anatomy and artistic representation, the hand appears correctly formed and attached.",
