      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the purple and deep red hues are part of a richly textured garment that appears to be made from luxurious materials like velvet or silk. The colors blend well with the golden embroidery, which is a common design choice in historical or royal attire. There are no abrupt color transitions; instead, the colors complement each other harmoniously. This integration suggests careful attention to detail in the design process, ensuring that the new colors enhance rather than clash with the overall appearance.",
