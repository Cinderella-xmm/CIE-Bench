      "question": "Does the bird’s body maintain accurate proportions and feather structure, with no distorted limbs, misplaced joints, or exaggerated features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bird in Image B is a highly detailed representation of a blue jay, featuring vibrant blue plumage with white accents on the wings and tail. The body proportions appear consistent with those of a real blue jay: the head is proportionate to the body, the beak is sharp and correctly shaped, and the legs are appropriately sized for perching. The feathers exhibit realistic layering and patterning, particularly on the wings and tail, which display alternating bands of blue and black with white tips—characteristic of a blue jay. There are no visible distortions in limb length, joint placement, or overall anatomy. The tail is long and slightly fanned, as expected, and the feet grip the perch naturally. Based on ornithological knowledge and visual assessment, the bird's morphology is anatomically accurate and not exaggerated.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome transparent with smooth surfaces, showing consistent reflections and refractions without visible seams, distortions, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is rendered with high clarity and transparency. It shows subtle reflections from ambient light sources, particularly near the top where light appears to enter from above. The curvature of the dome is smooth, and there are no visible seams or jagged edges that would suggest digital artifacts. Refractions are consistent—the interior elements (bird, perch, moss) appear slightly magnified and shifted due to the dome's curvature, which is physically accurate. There is no pixelation or unnatural texture on the surface of the glass. Reflections on the dome include faint outlines of the surrounding environment, indicating a polished, continuous surface. These visual cues align with how real glass domes behave under lighting conditions, suggesting a well-rendered, seamless object.",

      "question": "Is the wooden perch textured with realistic grain and positioned securely under the bird, with no gaps or floating sections suggesting instability?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden perch in Image B is depicted with fine wood grain patterns, knots, and natural color variation, giving it a realistic appearance. It is supported by a small tree stump base, which adds structural stability. The perch is firmly placed across the top of the stump, and the bird’s feet are clearly gripping it, with no visible gaps between the claws and the wood. The positioning appears balanced and secure, with no indication of floating or unsupported sections. The angle and thickness of the perch are appropriate for supporting a bird of this size. From a physical standpoint, the setup mimics a stable natural perch within a diorama, suggesting careful attention to realism and structural integrity.",

      "question": "Do the ivy vines curve naturally upward along the structure, with leaves spaced appropriately and no overlapping or clipping through the glass dome or bird?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ivy vine in Image B grows vertically along the right side of the glass dome, curving gently upward. The leaves are spaced at regular intervals and follow a natural growth pattern, with some leaves extending toward the center but not overlapping each other excessively. Importantly, none of the leaves intersect with the bird or penetrate the glass dome; they remain outside the enclosed space, adhering to the external surface. The vine does not appear to clip through any solid objects, and its path follows plausible botanical behavior—climbing upward and wrapping around the dome’s edge. This suggests careful modeling to preserve spatial coherence and avoid rendering errors.",

      "question": "Are the crafted leaves and tree stump proportionally small compared to the bird, with visible texture details and positioned on the moss-covered base without appearing out of place or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree stump and small leaves in Image B are significantly smaller than the bird, which is appropriate given their role as decorative elements in a miniature diorama. The stump has detailed bark texture, including cracks and ridges, and the leaves show veining and slight curling, indicating craftsmanship. They are placed on the moss-covered base, integrated into the scene without floating or being misaligned. Their scale relative to the bird and the overall composition is consistent with a carefully curated display. The positioning enhances the naturalistic feel without distracting from the central subject. No elements appear disproportionately large or incorrectly oriented.",

      "question": "Does the moss-covered base show variation in color and texture, resembling real organic growth, with no sharp edges or uniformity suggesting digital pasting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss-covered base in Image B exhibits a rich variety of green tones, ranging from bright lime to deep forest green, with patches of brown and tan that suggest natural decay and moisture variation. The texture is uneven, with tufts, clumps, and subtle undulations that mimic real moss growth. There are no sharp boundaries or repetitive patterns that would indicate digital cloning or pasting. The moss appears to grow organically around the tree stump and beneath the perch, integrating seamlessly with the other elements. This level of detail reflects an understanding of biological textures and avoids the flat, artificial look often seen in poorly rendered digital environments.",

      "question": "Are shadows cast by the bird, perch, and dome consistent with the light source in the upper right, with soft gradients and no mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to originate from the upper right, as indicated by the direction of highlights on the bird’s back, the top of the glass dome, and the illuminated side of the wooden base. Shadows are cast to the lower left of the bird, perch, and dome, consistent with this light direction. The shadows have soft edges and gradual gradients, especially under the bird and around the base, which suggests diffused lighting rather than harsh direct illumination. Highlights on the glass dome are smooth and reflect the light source accurately, without any unnatural glares or mismatches. There are no conflicting highlights or shadows that would suggest inconsistent lighting. Overall, the shadow and highlight placement demonstrates coherent lighting physics.",
