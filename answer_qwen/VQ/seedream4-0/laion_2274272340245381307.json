      "question": "Is the anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist fully integrated into the image with smooth contours, consistent line weight, and no visible seams or misaligned textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the anthropomorphic teddy bear scientist appears to be seamlessly integrated into the image. The contours of the bear are smooth and consistent with the rest of the image's style. There are no visible seams or misaligned textures that would suggest a poor integration. The line weight is uniform, contributing to a cohesive look. This conclusion is drawn from observing the bear's edges and how they blend with the background and other elements in the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the lab equipment illustrations (e.g., beakers, test tubes) proportionally accurate, geometrically intact, and aligned with the hand-drawn chalk style without jagged edges or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lab equipment illustrations in Image B, such as the beakers and test tubes, appear proportionally accurate and geometrically intact. They align well with the hand-drawn chalk style of the image, maintaining consistency in design. There are no jagged edges or unnatural shading present, which indicates careful attention to detail in their depiction. This analysis is based on examining the shapes and styles of these objects in relation to the overall aesthetic of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do all scientific symbols and doodles (such as planets, rockets, and formulas) have intact geometric forms, proper alignment, and no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scientific symbols and doodles in Image B, including planets, rockets, and formulas, exhibit intact geometric forms and proper alignment. There are no overlapping artifacts or misplaced lines that disrupt the visual integrity of these elements. Each symbol is distinct and contributes to the thematic coherence of the image. This assessment is made by closely inspecting each symbol for clarity and consistency within the context of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography (e.g., \"JOYFUL\", \"CURIOSITY\") clearly legible, stylistically consistent with the doodles, and free from blurring, stretching, or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in Image B, including words like 'JOYFUL' and 'CURIOSITY,' is clearly legible and stylistically consistent with the doodles. The text is free from blurring, stretching, or misalignment, ensuring that it complements the overall artistic style of the image. This conclusion is reached by evaluating the clarity and style of the text in relation to the surrounding elements.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters (e.g., bear, rabbit) exhibit correct limb positioning, proportional body parts, and logical interaction with nearby objects without unnatural poses or deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal characters in Image B, such as the bear and rabbit, display correct limb positioning and proportional body parts. Their interaction with nearby objects appears logical and natural, without any signs of unnatural poses or deformations. For instance, the bear's limbs are appropriately placed, and the rabbit is depicted in a realistic manner relative to its surroundings. This analysis involves assessing the anatomical correctness and spatial relationships of the characters within the image.",
