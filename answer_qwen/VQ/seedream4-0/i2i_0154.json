      "question": "Are there any noticeable artifacts or breaks in the car's bodywork where the different views meet?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is presented from multiple angles (side, top, and front). The transitions between these views are clean and do not show any visible artifacts or breaks. The edges of the car's bodywork appear smooth and continuous across all views. This conclusion is drawn by examining the lines and surfaces at the boundaries where one view ends and another begins, ensuring no interruptions or irregularities are present.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do all views of the car maintain consistent material properties and lighting, avoiding unnatural differences?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing Image B, the car's surface maintains a consistent reflective quality and lighting across all views. The reflections on the car's body and the shadows cast underneath it appear uniform, suggesting that the same light source and material properties were applied consistently. Comparing this with Image A, which shows a single perspective under natural lighting, the consistency in Image B is maintained through controlled studio-like lighting conditions, ensuring no unnatural differences arise.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the car's geometry appear proportionally correct and undistorted across all views, particularly in the wheels and body panels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car's geometry appears proportionally correct. The wheels and body panels maintain their shape and size consistently across the side, top, and front views. There are no distortions or disproportionate scaling that would suggest incorrect geometry. This assessment is based on observing the alignment and relative dimensions of various parts of the car in each view.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "In the top view, are the car's roofline and window outlines clear and detailed, without any loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top view in Image B clearly shows the car's roofline and window outlines with sharp and well-defined edges. Fine details such as the contours of the windows and the structure of the roof are visible and precise. This clarity indicates that the top view was rendered with attention to detail, preserving the car's design features accurately.",

      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the newly added views of the car integrate seamlessly with the background, without introducing any disruptive discontinuities or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents the car against a plain white background, which ensures that all views of the car integrate seamlessly without any background-related disruptions. Since the background is uniform and lacks any elements that could cause inconsistencies, the focus remains solely on the car, allowing for a seamless integration of its various views.",
