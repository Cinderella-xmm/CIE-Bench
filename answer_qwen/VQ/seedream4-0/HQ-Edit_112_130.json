      "question": "Does the brocade gown have natural-looking folds and volume in the puffy sleeves and skirt, with no stretched or flattened areas that contradict fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brocade gown exhibits natural-looking folds and volume in both the puffy sleeves and skirt. The fabric appears to drape realistically, with shadows and highlights that suggest a three-dimensional form. There are no visible areas where the fabric looks stretched or flattened in a way that contradicts typical fabric behavior. The analysis is based on observing how light interacts with the material and the consistency of the folds.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the rose blossoms evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation, and do they align with the direction of light without appearing pasted or duplicated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rose blossoms in Image B are evenly distributed along the branches with natural petal shapes and color variation. They align well with the direction of light, showing appropriate shading and highlights. There is no indication that they appear pasted or duplicated; instead, they seem integrated into the scene naturally. This conclusion is drawn from examining the distribution, lighting, and detail of each flower.",

      "question": "Do the wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues have consistent line work, proper shadowing, and spatial alignment with the ground plane and surrounding trees?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wrought-iron gazebos and marble statues in Image B have consistent line work and proper shadowing. The shadows cast by these objects align logically with the ground plane and surrounding trees, suggesting correct spatial alignment. The gazebo's intricate details and the statues' textures appear coherent with their materials and the environment. This assessment is made by analyzing the structural integrity and lighting consistency of these elements.",

      "question": "Does the left hand have five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does the right hand grip the bow in a physically plausible manner without extra digits or distorted joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The left hand in Image B has five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and the right hand grips the bow in a physically plausible manner. There are no extra digits or distorted joints visible, indicating that the hands are rendered accurately. This conclusion is reached by closely inspecting the positioning and anatomy of the hands in relation to the violin and bow.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues free from repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness that suggests low-resolution generation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brocade patterns on the gown, the metal mesh of the gazebo, and the stone texture of the statues in Image B do not exhibit repeating tiles, pixelation, or unnatural smoothness. Each element shows detailed textures that are consistent with high-resolution imagery. The brocade patterns are intricate and varied, the metal mesh is finely detailed, and the stone texture has realistic imperfections. This evaluation is based on scrutinizing the fine details and overall quality of these textures.",
