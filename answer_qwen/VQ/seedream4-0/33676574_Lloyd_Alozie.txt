    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tallest tower on the left has been modified with robotic limb features. However, its vertical structure and proportional height appear consistent with a typical skyscraper's design. There are no visible signs of stretching, compression, or broken edges that would suggest distortion. The limbs seem to be added as an overlay without altering the building's fundamental shape.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The neon circuitry patterns on the EMAAR building and nearby towers in Image B are visually integrated into the facade. The lines appear continuous without breaks, and the spacing seems even. The color gradients look natural for a digital rendering, suggesting a high-quality integration process.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The scale-like panels on the dark glass towers in Image B exhibit uniform texture and reflection behavior. There are no repeating patterns or distorted shapes that would indicate low-quality rendering. The reflections and textures align well with what one would expect from a polished surface under artificial lighting.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The glowing expressway spines in Image B maintain a realistic width and curvature throughout their length. They connect logically to surrounding roads and do not appear to float or have disconnected segments. The light trails follow the expected path of a road, enhancing the futuristic aesthetic without compromising realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The fin-like structures added to the tops of the buildings in Image B are properly aligned with the rooflines and scaled appropriately. They do not appear detached or structurally unstable. The alignment and scaling contribute to a cohesive and believable addition to the skyline.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6:",
    "explanation": "The holographic eye-like elements located on top of major towers in Image B are clearly defined with smooth light emission. There are no visible digital artifacts such as aliasing or double images. The elements stand out distinctly against the night sky, indicating a high level of detail in the rendering.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7:",
    "explanation": "All illuminated windows, signs, and architectural details (e.g., on the EMAAR building and VOCO tower) in Image B are sharp and legible. There is no visible blurring or degradation from the editing process. The clarity of these elements suggests that the editing was done with care to preserve the original quality of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
