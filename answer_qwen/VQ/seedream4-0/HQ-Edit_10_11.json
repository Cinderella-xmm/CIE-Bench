    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the entire body of the gorilla exhibit consistent wood texture and shading, with no sudden color changes or patches that appear non-wood-like?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gorilla's entire body appears to be carved from wood, with a consistent texture and shading throughout. The coloration is uniform in its wooden appearance, without any abrupt changes or patches that seem out of place. This consistency suggests careful craftsmanship aimed at maintaining a natural wood look.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body varied in depth and direction, resembling natural wood grain rather than repetitive or synthetic lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved fur patterns on the gorilla's body in Image B vary in depth and direction, mimicking the irregularities found in natural wood grain. These patterns are not repetitive or synthetic but rather detailed and organic, enhancing the realism of the carving.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs retain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures, with no flattened or unnaturally curved sections due to excessive smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arms and legs of the gorilla in Image B maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint structures. There are no flattened sections or unnatural curves; the limbs appear well-defined and smoothly integrated into the overall form of the gorilla.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background composed of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes integrated into it, maintaining depth and layering without appearing flat or disjointed from the gorilla?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of etched wood patterns with darker leaf shapes embedded within it. These elements contribute to a sense of depth and layering, complementing the gorilla without appearing flat or disconnected from the main subject.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scattered leaves in the background rendered in darker wood tones and placed in positions that suggest natural resting or embedding into the wooden surface, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scattered leaves in the background of Image B are rendered in darker wood tones and are positioned as if naturally resting or embedded into the wooden surface. They do not float or overlap incorrectly, which adds to the cohesive and realistic feel of the artwork.",
