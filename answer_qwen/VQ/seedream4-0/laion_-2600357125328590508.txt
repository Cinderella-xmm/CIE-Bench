    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO brick structures aligned with the original sock’s contours, maintaining consistent proportions and avoiding warped or stretched geometry?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO structure in Image B is a pixelated, block-based representation of a sock. The overall shape mimics the cylindrical form of a sock, tapering toward the toe and flaring slightly at the cuff. However, due to the inherent nature of LEGO bricks being cubic and uniform, the smooth curves of the original sock (such as the arch of the foot and the contour around the ankle) are approximated using stepped layers. This creates a 'stair-stepped' effect rather than fluid curves, which introduces geometric distortion. While the general proportions—height, width, and taper—are preserved, the geometry is inherently warped compared to the continuous surface of a real sock. Therefore, despite accurate scaling, the alignment with natural contours is compromised by the discrete nature of LEGO construction.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the layered LEGO bricks follow the natural curves of the sock, forming a cohesive 3D structure without gaps or misaligned layers?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO model uses stacked bricks to simulate the 3D form of the sock. While the structure appears largely cohesive and maintains a consistent thickness throughout its length, the transitions between curved sections—such as the heel and toe—are achieved through stepped layers rather than smooth gradients. These steps create visible angular breaks instead of following the natural curvature of the human foot. Additionally, there are no apparent gaps between the bricks, suggesting tight assembly, but the misalignment of layers at bends (e.g., around the arch) results in a blocky appearance that deviates from the organic flow of the original sock. Thus, while structurally sound, the model does not accurately replicate the natural curves.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the black, gray, and white LEGO bricks arranged to match the original sock's pattern layout, including the 'UNO' text and accent stripes, without color inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "The LEGO version reproduces the primary design elements of the original sock: the bold 'UNO' lettering on the side, the star motif, and the horizontal stripes near the toe and ankle. The color scheme—black, gray, and white—is faithfully maintained, with orange used for the tag at the top. The placement of these elements corresponds closely to the original, especially the large 'UNO' logo and the stripe patterns. Although the pixelation caused by individual LEGO bricks limits fine detail, the overall pattern layout is recognizable and consistent with the original sock. There are no noticeable color mismatches or misplaced blocks, indicating careful attention to design fidelity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Is the orange LEGO piece positioned at the top of the cuff and integrated into the brick structure without floating or unnatural attachment?",
    "explanation": "The orange LEGO piece is located at the very top center of the cuff, matching the position of the original sock's tag. It appears to be constructed from standard LEGO bricks with studs facing outward, consistent with typical LEGO design. The piece is flush with the surrounding black bricks and is supported by adjacent layers, suggesting it is securely integrated into the structure. There is no visual indication of floating or unsupported attachment; instead, it sits naturally within the cuff's architecture, mirroring the original tag's placement and function. Its integration appears intentional and structurally sound.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the sculpture presented upright against a clean, uniform background with even lighting that highlights its 3D form without casting unnatural shadows or reflections?",
    "explanation": "The sculpture is displayed on a white pedestal in what appears to be a gallery setting, with neutral beige walls and recessed ceiling lights providing diffuse illumination. The lighting is soft and evenly distributed, minimizing harsh shadows and allowing the texture and depth of the LEGO structure to be clearly visible. A subtle shadow is cast beneath the sculpture, which is natural given the light source direction and adds to the perception of three-dimensionality. There are no visible reflections or glare on the surface, and the background is uncluttered and uniform. This presentation enhances the artwork’s form and emphasizes its sculptural qualities without visual distractions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
