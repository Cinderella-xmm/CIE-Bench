      "question": "Do the fortress walls and towers exhibit a uniform golden-brown cookie dough texture with darker edges that match the lighting direction and do not show unnatural pixelation or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fortress in Image B is constructed from what appears to be cookie dough, exhibiting a consistent golden-brown color typical of baked cookies. The edges of the walls and towers are slightly darker, suggesting they have been baked more thoroughly or are shadowed, which aligns with the lighting direction coming from the upper left. This directional shading creates depth and volume, enhancing the three-dimensional appearance. The texture appears smooth and cohesive, without visible pixelation or abrupt changes in tone. There are no signs of digital artifacts such as jagged lines or inconsistent surface patterns. The uniformity of the texture across all structural elements supports the conclusion that the material is consistently rendered as cookie dough.",

      "question": "Are the waterfalls rendered as smooth, continuous streams of royal icing that follow the natural contour of the cliff and show appropriate sheen and thickness without appearing clumped or broken?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waterfalls in Image B are depicted using white royal icing, which flows down the cliff face in multiple strands. These strands follow the natural contours of the rocky terrain, mimicking the flow of real water over uneven surfaces. The icing has a glossy sheen, indicating a wet, viscous consistency typical of royal icing. The thickness of the streams is consistent, and there are no visible breaks or clumps that would suggest poor application. The way the icing drips and pools at the base suggests careful attention to gravity and fluid dynamics, reinforcing the illusion of realistic water flow. The continuity and smoothness of the streams support the idea that they were carefully applied to simulate natural waterfalls.",

      "question": "Are the trees formed from green marzipan positioned naturally on the terrain, maintaining plausible size and shape without appearing compressed, misshapen, or disconnected from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are small, conical structures made from green marzipan, placed on the sandy terrain surrounding the cookie fortress. They are uniformly shaped like miniature pine trees, with a consistent size relative to the scale of the fortress and the surrounding landscape. Each tree is mounted on a small brown base, simulating a trunk, which connects it to the ground. Their placement is scattered but not random, resembling a natural distribution of vegetation in a desert environment. There are no visible distortions, compression artifacts, or floating elements. The trees appear proportionate and grounded, contributing to the overall realism of the edible scene.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the white ceramic platter clearly visible beneath the cookie fortress, extending outward with clean edges and casting a soft shadow that aligns with the light source, without appearing to float or distort the surrounding terrain?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white ceramic platter in Image B is clearly visible beneath the entire structure of the cookie fortress. It extends outward beyond the base of the fortress, forming a flat platform that supports the edible construction. The edges of the platter are clean and well-defined, with no visual distortion or warping. A soft shadow is cast beneath the platter, consistent with the lighting direction from the upper left, which matches the shadows seen on the fortress and surrounding elements. The platter does not appear to float; instead, it rests firmly on the sandy surface, and the terrain around it remains undisturbed. This indicates careful rendering to maintain physical plausibility and visual coherence.",

      "question": "Are there any visible seams, texture discontinuities, or abrupt transitions between the cookie dough fortress, royal icing waterfalls, and marzipan trees that suggest poor blending or rendering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the transition between the cookie dough fortress and the royal icing waterfalls is smooth, with the icing flowing naturally from the edge of the fortress down the cliff. The boundary between the two materials is seamless, with no visible cracks or gaps. Similarly, the marzipan trees are attached to the cookie base with no apparent seams or disconnections. The textures of each component—cookie dough, icing, and marzipan—are consistent within their respective materials and blend logically into one another. There are no abrupt color shifts, texture mismatches, or digital artifacts that would indicate poor rendering. The overall composition appears cohesive and professionally crafted, suggesting high-quality digital modeling and texturing.",
