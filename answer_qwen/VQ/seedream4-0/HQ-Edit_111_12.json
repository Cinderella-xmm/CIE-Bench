      "question": "Are the enlarged knitting needles proportionally consistent with the size of the woman's hands and aligned naturally with her fingers without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitting needles appear to be significantly larger than typical knitting needles used in real-life knitting. They are disproportionately long and thick relative to the woman’s hands, which would make them impractical for actual use. The alignment of the needles with her fingers appears somewhat unnatural—specifically, the angle at which the needles are held suggests an exaggerated grip that does not reflect realistic hand positioning during knitting. In reality, knitting needles are generally slender and balanced, allowing for smooth manipulation between the fingers. Here, the exaggerated scale and stiff posture suggest a stylized or cartoonish interpretation rather than a physically accurate one. This deviation from natural proportions and biomechanics indicates that the needles are not proportionally consistent nor aligned naturally.",

      "question": "Do the steam lines above the teacup rise smoothly from the rim in a continuous, curved pattern without sharp breaks or unnatural angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam rising from the teacup in Image B is depicted as a series of thin, white, swirling lines. These lines originate from the cup’s rim and curve upward in a gentle, flowing motion, consistent with how heat-induced vapor typically behaves in still air. The curvature is smooth and continuous, without any abrupt changes in direction or sharp angles. The design follows natural fluid dynamics principles—steam tends to rise and curl due to convection currents, and this depiction captures that behavior in a stylized but plausible way. There are no visible breaks or jagged transitions in the steam paths, suggesting a deliberate artistic choice that maintains visual coherence and realism within the cartoon style. Thus, the steam lines appear to rise smoothly and naturally.",

      "question": "Does the transformed yarn pattern on the fabric retain consistent knit stitches and natural thread flow without visible pixelation or irregular textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The knitted fabric in Image B shows a detailed texture with clearly defined vertical ribbing patterns, resembling a standard stockinette or ribbed stitch. The threads appear to follow a logical path, with consistent spacing and uniformity across the visible portion of the scarf. There is no noticeable pixelation, distortion, or irregularity in the weave; instead, the texture looks intentionally rendered with clean lines and shading that simulate depth and materiality. The color gradient along the yarn remains consistent, and there are no artifacts such as jagged edges or repeating patterns that would suggest digital corruption. Given that this is a stylized illustration, the level of detail is appropriate and maintains visual continuity, indicating a high-quality rendering of the yarn pattern.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the writing panel positioned within the open book pages such that its edges align naturally with the page boundaries and the knitted border matches the texture and color of the surrounding fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the open book rests on the woman’s lap, and a rectangular panel with text and a decorative knitted border is placed on the left page. The panel's edges are neatly aligned with the page margins, suggesting careful placement. However, the knitted border around the text area is colored in a reddish-orange tone, which contrasts sharply with the teal color of the actual knitted scarf beneath it. Moreover, the texture of the border appears more like a flat, stylized embroidery rather than an integrated part of the fabric. While the alignment is precise, the color mismatch and lack of textural continuity suggest that the border is not meant to represent a physical extension of the scarf but rather a symbolic or illustrative element. Therefore, although the positioning is natural, the knitted border does not match the texture or color of the surrounding fabric, breaking visual consistency.",

      "question": "Does the added lamplight effect produce a gradual glow around the book and cup without creating unnatural bright spots or conflicting shadows on the armchair or wall?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamplight in Image B casts a soft, warm glow primarily over the book and the teacup, enhancing their visibility while contributing to the cozy atmosphere. The illumination appears to emanate from the lamp on the right side of the frame, creating a subtle gradient of light that fades outward. There are no harsh bright spots or overexposed areas on the objects or surfaces. Shadows remain consistent with the light source—darkening gradually toward the back and sides, particularly on the armchair and the wall behind the bookshelf. The lighting integrates well with the overall scene, maintaining spatial logic and avoiding visual contradictions. The glow adds depth without distorting the form or introducing artificial highlights. Thus, the lamplight effect is rendered realistically and harmoniously within the composition.",
