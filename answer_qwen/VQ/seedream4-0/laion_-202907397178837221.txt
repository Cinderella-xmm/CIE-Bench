    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the skyscrapers have been edited to feature pixel-patterned facades. By closely examining these patterns, they appear to align well with the original building outlines. There are no visible distorted edges or misaligned blocks that would suggest a poor fit. The pixel patterns seem to follow the contours of the buildings logically, indicating careful editing work.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The digital circuits forming the trees in Image B are angular and intricate. Upon inspection, these circuits appear to be connected logically from the base to the tip of each tree. There are no floating segments or disconnected parts visible, suggesting that the design was implemented with attention to detail to maintain continuity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The neon lights along the bridge in Image B run continuously along the rail tracks and side panels. There are no noticeable gaps or incorrect bends in the light trails. The lines flow smoothly, following the structure of the bridge, which indicates that the editing was done with precision.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "All the skyscrapers in the skyline of Image B have been uniformly converted to pixel-patterned luminous towers. Each building displays the same style of pixelation, and there are no partial conversions or missing elements. This uniformity suggests a consistent application of the editing effect across all structures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "After analyzing Image B, it is clear that while significant edits have been made, certain details like the window grids on the buildings, individual beams of the bridge, and foliage of non-digital trees remain visible and undistorted. These elements retain their clarity despite the futuristic overlay, showing that the editing process preserved some original features.",
    "answer": "Yes"
