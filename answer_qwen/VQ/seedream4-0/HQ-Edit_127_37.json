      "question": "Does the chibi knight maintain consistent metallic texture across the armor, with no visible warping or unnatural smoothing of surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi knight's armor appears to have a consistent metallic texture. The visual cues suggest that the artist has maintained a uniform appearance on the armor pieces, such as the helmet and shield. There is no noticeable warping or unnatural smoothing that would disrupt the metallic look. The reflective properties and shading are coherent with what one would expect from metal in a stylized, cartoonish depiction.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome visually coherent, with clear edges and realistic light refraction, and does it enclose all elements without intersecting or clipping through them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears visually coherent with clear edges. It seems to realistically refract light, which adds to its believability as a transparent object. All elements within the scene, including the knight, sheep, dragon, and castle, are enclosed by the dome without any apparent intersections or clipping issues. This suggests careful design to ensure all components fit naturally within the dome's boundaries.",

      "question": "Does the shield retain its embossed lion design and metallic sheen, with no visible loss of fine detail or unnatural flatness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shield in Image B retains an embossed design, though it is not clearly identifiable as a lion due to the chibi style. However, it maintains a metallic sheen consistent with the rest of the armor. There is no significant loss of fine detail, and the surface does not appear unnaturally flat. The artistic style simplifies details but preserves the overall impression of a textured, metallic shield.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sheep proportionally small compared to the knight, with natural wool texture and anatomically correct forms, and are they positioned on the ground without floating or clipping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sheep in Image B are proportionally small relative to the knight, fitting the scale of the miniature scene. They exhibit a natural wool texture typical of a stylized representation. Their forms are anatomically plausible for sheep, and they are positioned on the ground, appearing neither to float nor clip through other elements. This indicates attention to detail in maintaining the scene's realism within its artistic constraints.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the dragonâ€™s body form a continuous, non-intersecting curve around the turret, with consistent scaly texture and no visible gaps or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dragon in Image B has a body that curves around the turret in a continuous manner, without any visible intersections that would disrupt its form. The scaly texture is consistent throughout the dragon's body, and there are no apparent gaps or deformations that would detract from its appearance. The design ensures the dragon looks like a cohesive creature integrated into the scene.",
