      "question": "Does the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo appear smooth and well-integrated without any unnatural edges or blurring around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo is located on the door shelf of the refrigerator, positioned above a row of bottles. Visually, the logo appears sharp with clean, defined edges. There is no visible blurring or pixelation around the text or background of the logo. The colors are vibrant and consistent with typical printed labels, and the font style matches common branding aesthetics. The integration into the white shelf surface is seamless, suggesting that the logo was either digitally rendered with high precision or physically applied with care. Given the clarity and lack of artifacts such as jagged lines or softening effects, the logo appears to be smoothly integrated into the scene. This conclusion is supported by world knowledge about digital image editing standards, where high-quality overlays maintain crisp edges and consistent texture.",

      "question": "Is the custom label on the top shelf placed appropriately, without distorting the surrounding items or creating visual inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The custom label reading 'User's Name' is positioned at the top center of the refrigerator, just below the brand name. It is aligned horizontally and centered, which is a typical placement for personalization or branding elements. The label does not overlap or obscure any existing components like the hinge mechanism or internal lighting. Surrounding items—such as the jar of what appears to be yogurt and the bowl of popcorn—are undisturbed and remain in their natural positions. There is no visible warping, shadow displacement, or misalignment caused by the addition of this label. From a design perspective, placing a label here is logical because it’s a neutral space often used for customization without interfering with functional areas. The label’s size and font are proportionate to the refrigerator’s scale, contributing to a balanced visual composition. Therefore, based on both visual analysis and design principles, the label is placed appropriately.",

      "question": "Are the texture and details around the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label consistent with the rest of the refrigerator's surface, avoiding any noticeable loss or alteration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surface of the refrigerator door and top panel appears to have a smooth, matte finish typical of modern appliances. Around the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the 'User's Name' label, there is no visible change in texture—no scratches, gloss variations, or unevenness that would suggest post-processing artifacts. The area surrounding the labels maintains the same uniformity in color and reflectivity as the rest of the appliance. In digital imaging, any alteration that affects texture (e.g., smoothing, sharpening) usually results in subtle inconsistencies like halos or noise. However, these are absent here. Furthermore, the labels themselves do not exhibit any distortion or degradation in detail; the text remains legible and clear. Based on world knowledge of product rendering and surface continuity, such consistency indicates careful integration, preserving the original material appearance. Thus, the textures are preserved and consistent.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label maintain appropriate scaling relative to their surrounding elements, appearing neither too large nor too small?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo is sized to fit within the door shelf’s width, occupying approximately one-third of the available horizontal space. Its height is proportionate to the bottle caps and labels nearby, ensuring it doesn’t dominate the shelf visually. Similarly, the 'User's Name' label at the top is scaled to match standard branding fonts found on appliances—neither oversized nor minuscule. Comparing these labels to real-world examples, such as manufacturer stickers or user-customized decals, they align with typical dimensions. The font sizes are readable but not exaggerated, and the spacing between letters is even, indicating professional design. No element appears disproportionately large or small relative to the refrigerator’s overall structure or other objects inside. This balance supports a realistic and aesthetically pleasing presentation, consistent with expectations from product customization.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and shadowing on the 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the custom label correspond logically to the light source, contributing to a natural and authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The primary light source in the image appears to come from the top interior of the refrigerator, casting a soft, diffused glow downward. The 'Xu's Fresh Zone' logo and the 'User's Name' label both show subtle highlights along their upper edges and slight shadows beneath, consistent with overhead illumination. These lighting cues are minimal but present, matching how light interacts with flat surfaces in enclosed spaces. There is no harsh glare or unnatural dark spots that would indicate inconsistent lighting. Additionally, the labels do not cast shadows onto adjacent objects (like bottles), which is expected since they are flush with the surface. The absence of over-contrast or artificial brightness suggests that the lighting has been carefully simulated to mimic real-world conditions. Based on principles of photorealistic rendering, this level of lighting coherence enhances authenticity. Therefore, the lighting and shadowing are logically consistent with the environment.",
