      "question": "Do the crystal facets on the fish's body follow the natural curves and scale patterns of the original wooden carving without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal fish is composed of numerous faceted surfaces that mimic the form of a fish coiled into a spiral. The facets are arranged in a way that follows the general curvature of the fish’s body, particularly along the dorsal and ventral lines, as well as around the fins and tail. These facets appear to be aligned with the underlying organic shape, suggesting an intentional design to preserve the fluidity of the original form. However, due to the nature of crystal faceting—where flat planes are used to create reflective surfaces—the transitions between facets introduce angular breaks rather than smooth curves. This introduces a degree of geometric abstraction compared to the continuous, flowing contours seen in organic forms like wood carvings. While the overall silhouette and flow of the fish are preserved, the 'scale patterns' in the original wooden carving (which would have been subtle ridges or grooves) are replaced by sharp, angular facets. Therefore, while the general curvature is respected, the transition from natural scale-like textures to geometric facets constitutes a form of geometric distortion. Thus, the answer must reflect that the pattern does not perfectly follow the natural curves without distortion.",

      "question": "Are the glossy surfaces of the crystal fish uniformly reflective and free from abrupt texture changes or matte patches that break the illusion of fluidity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal fish in Image B exhibits a high degree of glossiness across its surface, with multiple facets reflecting light in a consistent manner. Each facet appears polished and transparent, contributing to a uniform sparkle and clarity. There are no visible matte patches or areas where the surface seems dull or unevenly finished. The reflections across the facets are sharp and coherent, indicating that the material is uniformly treated. The interplay of light across the angled surfaces enhances the sense of fluidity through dynamic reflection rather than static texture. Since the entire sculpture maintains a consistent refractive quality and there are no visual disruptions such as scratches, smudges, or non-reflective zones, it can be concluded that the glossy surfaces are indeed uniformly reflective and do not contain abrupt texture changes. The illusion of fluidity is maintained through the careful alignment of facets and consistent surface finish.",

      "question": "Is the spiral shape of the fish preserved in the crystal version, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spiral shape of the fish in Image B is clearly defined, forming a near-perfect loop that mirrors the circular motion seen in the original wooden carving. The head of the fish points outward from the spiral, while the tail curves inward, completing the loop. The proportions of the body segments—from the head to the midsection to the tail—are consistent with the expected anatomy of a fish in such a pose. There is no visible elongation or shortening of any segment; each part of the fish maintains a proportional relationship with the others. The symmetry and continuity of the spiral suggest that the transformation from wood to crystal has preserved the spatial integrity of the original form. No misalignment is evident in the joints or bends of the body, and the curve remains smooth throughout. Given that the structure maintains its intended geometry without distortion, the spiral shape is accurately preserved.",

      "question": "Does the mirrored pedestal beneath the crystal fish reflect the sculpture accurately, with no visible distortions or missing reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pedestal in Image B is made of highly reflective mirrored material, likely glass or polished metal, and it supports the crystal fish. The reflection of the sculpture on the pedestal is clear and symmetrical, capturing the full lower portion of the fish. The reflected image shows the same color gradients, facet patterns, and structural details as the actual sculpture. There are no visible warping, blurring, or missing parts in the reflection, which indicates that the mirror surface is flat and clean. The lighting conditions in the gallery environment are even, minimizing glare or shadow interference. Additionally, the edges of the reflection align precisely with the base of the sculpture, confirming accurate representation. Therefore, the mirrored surface performs its function effectively, providing a faithful and undistorted reflection.",

      "question": "Are the fine details such as the gill lines, eye sockets, and fin textures clearly preserved in the crystal version without fading or smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the crystal fish features intricate detailing. The eye sockets are clearly defined, with small facets creating depth and dimension, mimicking the placement and shape of eyes in the original carving. The gill area, located behind the head, is represented by a series of parallel, angled facets that suggest the presence of gill slits, though they are stylized rather than anatomically precise. Similarly, the fins display layered facets that simulate the texture and structure of real fins, with distinct ridges and overlapping segments. However, due to the nature of crystal fabrication, some fine details may be abstracted or simplified for structural integrity and aesthetic effect. For example, the gill lines are not as finely etched as they might be in wood but are instead suggested through larger-scale facets. The eye sockets are present but lack the subtlety of engraved depth seen in wood. Despite this, all key elements are discernible and not faded or smoothed out. They are preserved in a stylized yet recognizable form. Therefore, while not identical to the original, the details are clearly represented without significant loss.",
