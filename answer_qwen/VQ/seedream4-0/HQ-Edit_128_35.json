      "question": "Is the typewriter’s keyboard area preserved with correct key layout and spacing, and does the body maintain a coherent rectangular form without warped edges or missing parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the typewriter depicted on the notebook cover shows a keyboard area with keys that appear to be in a standard QWERTY layout, which is typical for typewriters. The spacing between the keys seems consistent and logical for a functional design. The body of the typewriter maintains a rectangular form without any visible warping or missing parts. This analysis is based on visual inspection of the image and knowledge of common typewriter designs.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the text \"Tales Untold\" positioned above the keyboard area without covering any functional parts of the typewriter, and does it follow a horizontal baseline consistent with the notebook’s orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Tales Untold' is positioned above the keyboard area of the typewriter on the notebook cover. It does not overlap with the keys or other functional parts of the typewriter. The text follows a horizontal baseline that aligns well with the orientation of the notebook, ensuring readability and aesthetic balance. This conclusion is drawn from observing the placement and alignment of the text relative to the typewriter and the notebook's edges.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the ink splatters scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges, and do they not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ink splatters on the notebook cover are scattered irregularly across the surface, with varying sizes and soft edges. They do not obscure important structural elements like the keys or paper of the typewriter. This assessment is based on examining the distribution and appearance of the ink splatters in relation to the typewriter and other features on the notebook cover.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the marbled background continue evenly under the entire base of the notebook cover, with no visible gaps, clipping, or abrupt color shifts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marbled background under the notebook cover appears to continue evenly without visible gaps or abrupt color shifts at the edges. The pattern flows smoothly beneath the entire base of the notebook, contributing to a cohesive and polished look. This evaluation is made by closely inspecting the continuity and uniformity of the marbled texture around the notebook.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the leather spine show a consistent texture with slight color variation, and are the embossed key icons evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather spine of the notebook displays a consistent texture with slight color variation, which is characteristic of genuine or high-quality imitation leather. The embossed key icons along the spine are evenly spaced, correctly shaped, and shaded to suggest depth, enhancing the realistic and detailed appearance of the notebook. This conclusion is reached by analyzing the texture, color, and embossing details of the spine in the image.",
