    "Question": "Q1: Are the polar bears fully intact, with their proportions and textures appearing natural and undistorted?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the polar bears are clearly visible and positioned naturally on the ice. Their body proportions—such as the size of the head relative to the body, limb length, and overall shape—are consistent with real polar bears. The fur texture appears soft and continuous, with no visible warping, stretching, or unnatural smoothing that would suggest digital distortion. The lighting on the bears is uniform and matches the ambient light from the environment, reinforcing the natural appearance. There are no signs of clipping, ghosting, or pixelation around the edges of the bears. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about animal anatomy and digital image editing, the bears appear fully intact and realistically rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the cooled color tone appear seamlessly integrated into the environment, avoiding unnatural color gradients or patches?",
    "explanation": "The overall color tone in Image B is cooler than typical daylight scenes, emphasizing blues and whites, which aligns with a polar environment. The ice reflects this cool tone consistently, and there are no abrupt transitions or artificial-looking patches between areas of different hues. The water in the background maintains a deep blue, blending smoothly with the lighter tones of the ice. The lighting appears even across the scene, without harsh shadows or over-saturated regions that might indicate poor color grading. Given that cold environments naturally have such tonal qualities, the cooled palette is plausible and well-integrated, enhancing realism rather than disrupting it. No visible artifacts like banding or chromatic aberration are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the bold headline 'Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.' free of jagged edges or pixelation and does not obscure important details of the ice and bears?",
    "explanation": "The text 'Only Ice Left. Nowhere to Go.' is placed in the upper right corner of the image. It is rendered in a clean, sans-serif font with sharp, smooth edges, indicating high-resolution rendering and no pixelation or aliasing. The white text contrasts well against the dark blue water background, making it highly legible without blending into the surroundings. Importantly, the text does not overlap with any critical parts of the polar bears or the central ice formation. The bears remain fully visible and unobstructed, preserving the emotional impact of the image. Therefore, the placement and quality of the text are effective and non-intrusive.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the organization logo and website at the bottom legible yet unobtrusive, ensuring they do not interfere with the depiction of the ice and bears?",
    "explanation": "The logo and website address ('climateaction.org' and 'www.climateaction.org') are located at the bottom center of the image. They are small in size and use a simple, clean design with a modest color scheme (blue and white) that blends subtly with the icy background. The text is clear and readable due to good contrast and appropriate font size. Crucially, they are positioned below the main subjects (the bears), so they do not obstruct any key elements of the composition. Their presence is noticeable enough for branding but not dominant, maintaining the focus on the bears and the environmental message. This balance ensures both functionality and aesthetic harmony.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the combination of the modified image elements, including the text and logo, uphold a realistic and coherent style without creating any visually confusing elements?",
    "explanation": "The edited image combines photographic realism with minimal graphic overlays. The polar bears and environment retain a naturalistic appearance, with no evident digital manipulation that disrupts believability. The added text and logo are stylistically consistent with environmental advocacy materials—clear, purposeful, and professionally designed. The color palette remains cohesive, and all elements (bears, ice, water, text, logo) are aligned spatially and thematically. There are no conflicting visual styles, such as cartoonish effects or mismatched fonts, that would break immersion. The overall effect is one of urgency and authenticity, supporting the intended message without introducing confusion or distraction. Thus, the integration of elements is successful and coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
