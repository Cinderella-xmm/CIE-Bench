      "question": "Do the embossed tribal patterns on the ceramic pots maintain consistent texture and depth with the original material, without visible artifacts such as floating lines or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two ceramic pots are depicted in a stylized, cartoonish illustration style. The embossed tribal patterns on these pots are simplified and rendered with clean, bold lines that follow traditional geometric motifs commonly found in African pottery. These patterns appear flat and two-dimensional due to the artistic style, but they do not exhibit floating lines or distorted geometry. The textures are consistent with the illustrative medium—using hatching and shading to suggest depth—but they are not photorealistic. Since the image is clearly an artistic interpretation rather than a photograph, 'consistent texture and depth' must be evaluated within the context of the drawing style. Within this framework, the patterns maintain visual coherence and do not show artifacts like floating lines or geometric distortions. Therefore, the rendering is faithful to the intended stylistic representation.",

      "question": "Are the expanded motifs on the dress proportionally consistent with the garment’s structure, and do they avoid unnatural stretching or breaking of fabric lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B features vibrant, intricate patterns typical of African wax prints, which are known for their bold, symmetrical designs. In this illustration, the motifs are enlarged and emphasized compared to the more realistic depiction in Image A. However, the expansion appears intentional and stylistically consistent with the cartoon aesthetic. The fabric lines remain continuous and follow natural draping patterns around the body, with no visible tearing or unnatural stretching. The design elements are scaled up but still respect the overall silhouette of the dress. While some details may be exaggerated for visual impact, there is no evidence of broken seams or inconsistent proportions that would suggest digital distortion. Thus, within the context of the artistic style, the motifs are proportionally consistent and do not violate fabric logic.",

      "question": "Do the transformed bread and cucumber retain recognizable forms as food items while incorporating character features, without unnatural deformations or texture inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bread and cucumber have been anthropomorphized into cartoon characters. The bread slice has arms, legs, eyes, and a smile, while the cucumber also has facial features and limbs. Despite these additions, both retain their basic shapes: the bread is clearly a slice of white bread with a crust, and the cucumber is elongated and green with characteristic bumps. The texture of the bread (pores and crumb) and the cucumber (bumpy skin) are simplified but still recognizable. The character features are added in a way that does not obscure the underlying form. There are no unnatural deformations—such as melting or misshapen contours—and the textures are consistent with the cartoon style. This transformation aligns with common practices in children's illustrations where food items are given personalities while maintaining identity. Hence, the objects remain identifiable as bread and cucumber despite the character traits.",

      "question": "Are the boundaries of each postcard vignette cleanly separated from the original image without cutting off elements or introducing edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B presents a composite layout with three distinct sections: two smaller postcard-style vignettes on the left and a larger illustrated version of the woman on the right. The top-left vignette shows two ceramic pots, and the bottom-left shows the anthropomorphic bread and cucumber. Both are framed within lined paper backgrounds resembling notebook pages. These vignettes are neatly cropped and isolated, with no visible bleed or overlap into adjacent areas. The edges are clean, and the content within each box is fully contained. The main figure on the right side of the image is seamlessly integrated into the scene, with no clipping or jagged edges at the boundary between her and the background. The transitions between the different sections are clear and deliberate, suggesting intentional design choices rather than technical errors. Therefore, the boundaries are well-defined and free of edge artifacts.",

      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand (visible near the stove) have five fingers with natural proportions and positioning, and does it cast a shadow consistent with the light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the woman's right hand is partially visible near the stove, resting on what appears to be a countertop or appliance. Due to the stylized nature of the illustration, the hand is simplified and lacks detailed anatomical precision. It appears to have five fingers, but they are drawn in a cartoonish manner with rounded tips and minimal detail. The proportions are somewhat exaggerated—fingers are short and thick—but still within acceptable bounds for a cartoon style. As for shadows, the lighting in the image seems to come from the front-right, illuminating the woman’s face and dress. However, the hand does not cast a distinct shadow, likely because the artist chose to minimize shading for stylistic clarity. In cartoon illustrations, shadows are often omitted or simplified to maintain visual cleanliness. Given that this is not a photorealistic rendering, the absence of a visible shadow is not an error but a stylistic choice. Therefore, while the hand has five fingers and reasonable proportions for the art style, the lack of a shadow is consistent with the illustration’s approach.",
