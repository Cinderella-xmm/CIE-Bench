      "question": "Does the frosted crystal frame preserve the original carved details (such as the floral crest and side columns) without warping or flattening the shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the frosted crystal frame appears to maintain the intricate carved details such as the floral crest and side columns. The shapes seem preserved without warping or flattening, as the visual cues suggest a consistent texture and depth across these elements. The translucency of the crystal does not obscure the details but rather enhances them by giving a delicate, frosty appearance. This conclusion is drawn from observing the clarity and definition of the carvings in the crystal material.",

      "question": "Are the Roman numerals etched into the crystal face evenly spaced, legible, and aligned with the original hour positions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Roman numerals on the crystal face in Image B are clearly etched and evenly spaced. They align well with the expected hour positions, maintaining legibility and proportion. By comparing this with common clock designs, it's evident that the numerals follow standard placement rules for clocks, ensuring they are aligned correctly with the hour markers.",

      "question": "Is the faceted crystal pendulum symmetrically shaped, properly suspended by the chains, and free from floating or misaligned connections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The faceted crystal pendulum in Image B is symmetrically shaped and properly suspended by chains. There are no signs of floating or misaligned connections; the pendulum appears securely attached and naturally positioned below the clock. The symmetry and suspension are assessed based on the visible alignment and the natural way light interacts with the facets, indicating proper construction.",

      "question": "Is the white marble wall uniformly textured, free from visible stitching or artificial boundaries, and does it cast soft, natural shadows beneath the clock?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white marble wall in Image B has a uniform texture with no visible stitching or artificial boundaries. The soft shadows beneath the clock appear natural, suggesting a smooth surface that casts subtle shadows due to lighting. This analysis is based on the consistent pattern and coloration of the marble, along with the realistic shadowing effects.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the crystal components (frame, face, pendulum) visually integrated without noticeable gaps, material inconsistencies, or unnatural reflections at their junctions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal components in Image B—the frame, face, and pendulum—are visually integrated seamlessly. There are no noticeable gaps or material inconsistencies at their junctions. The reflections and refractions of light through the crystal create a cohesive look, enhancing the integration of these parts. This conclusion is reached by examining the continuity of the crystal's appearance and the absence of any jarring transitions between components.",
