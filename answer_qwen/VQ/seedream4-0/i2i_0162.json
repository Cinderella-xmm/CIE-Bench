      "question": "Does the mouse's fur texture appear smooth and maintain the natural look expected in a Pixar-style animation without unnatural or overly simplified patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse’s fur exhibits a high level of detail with visible individual strands and subtle variations in color and shading, particularly around the head, back, and tail. This complexity aligns well with Pixar’s animation style, which emphasizes realistic textures while maintaining stylized clarity. The fur is not uniformly flat or overly simplified; instead, it shows depth and volume through lighting and shadow effects that mimic real-world physics. The transition between different fur tones (from dark gray on the back to orange-brown on the face) is smooth and gradual, suggesting careful attention to naturalistic rendering. Pixar animations often use advanced techniques like subsurface scattering and layered rendering to achieve such lifelike yet stylized textures. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of Pixar’s aesthetic standards, the fur texture appears both smooth and naturally detailed.",

      "question": "Are the mouse's ears, eyes, and whiskers proportionally correct and not distorted relative to its body size in the Pixar animation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mouse's features are clearly exaggerated in a way consistent with Pixar’s signature animation style—specifically, large expressive eyes, prominent ears, and long, delicate whiskers. These elements are proportionally enlarged compared to a real mouse but remain within the bounds of cartoonish realism typical of Pixar films (e.g., 'Ratatouille' or 'Finding Nemo'). The eyes are large and round, enhancing expressiveness, while the ears are slightly oversized but symmetrical and anatomically plausible for an animated character. The whiskers extend outward with fine detail and appropriate spacing, contributing to the character’s alertness. There is no distortion such as asymmetry, disproportionate scaling, or unnatural curvature. Given that Pixar often uses anthropomorphic exaggeration to convey emotion, these proportions are intentional and stylistically appropriate. Thus, despite being stylized, the features are proportionally correct within the context of Pixar animation.",

      "question": "Do the soft shadows under the mouse and surrounding crumbs appear naturally integrated into the scene without any harsh or misplaced artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows beneath the mouse and the crumbs in Image B are soft, diffused, and follow the direction of ambient light, likely coming from above and slightly to the front-left. They cast gentle gradients that blend seamlessly into the floor, indicating a well-modeled light source and proper rendering technique. There are no sharp edges or sudden breaks in shadow intensity, which would suggest artificiality or poor compositing. The crumbs also cast faint, realistic micro-shadows, adding depth without overemphasizing them. In Pixar-style animation, lighting is carefully balanced to create a sense of volume and realism even in stylized environments. The absence of harsh lines or floating shadows indicates that the shadows are naturally integrated. Furthermore, the interaction between the shadow and the tile grout lines suggests accurate depth perception and surface modeling. Based on these observations and Pixar’s known emphasis on photorealistic lighting in animated scenes, the shadows appear natural and artifact-free.",

      "question": "Does the floor's texture retain sufficient detail and pattern authenticity in the Pixar animation style, avoiding unnatural smoothing or artificial patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floor in Image B consists of square tiles with visible grout lines and slight surface imperfections, such as minor scratches and variations in tone. These details contribute to a sense of realism and tactile authenticity, which is characteristic of Pixar’s approach to environmental design—where even simple surfaces are rendered with care to enhance immersion. The tile pattern is regular but not perfectly uniform; there are subtle differences in shading and reflection across the tiles, suggesting material variation and wear. This avoids the 'too clean' or 'over-smoothed' appearance sometimes seen in low-quality renders. Additionally, the reflections and highlights on the floor surface indicate a glossy finish consistent with ceramic tiles, further grounding the scene in reality. Pixar often includes such nuanced textural details to ground animated characters in believable worlds. Therefore, the floor retains sufficient detail and avoids artificial simplification, aligning with Pixar’s standards.",

      "question": "Are the crumbs' sizes and shapes consistent and believable within the context of the image, without displaying any unnatural irregularities or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crumbs scattered around the mouse in Image B vary in size and shape, ranging from small granules to larger clumps, which mimics how real food debris might break apart on a kitchen floor. Their forms are irregular but not geometrically perfect or unnaturally uniform, suggesting they were created by crushing or crumbling bread or similar food. Each crumb has a textured surface with slight indentations and edges, contributing to a natural appearance. There are no obvious digital artifacts such as repeating patterns or perfectly circular shapes that would indicate artificial generation. Moreover, their distribution follows a logical pattern—clustered near the mouse and spreading outwards—consistent with natural movement. Pixar animations typically pay close attention to such environmental details to enhance believability, using procedural modeling or hand-crafted assets to simulate organic matter. Since the crumbs appear varied, textured, and spatially coherent, they are consistent with real-world expectations and do not display unnatural distortions.",
