    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The body of the animal in Image B is composed of small, square-shaped tiles that appear to be glossy and ceramic-like in texture. These tiles are uniformly sized and arranged in a grid pattern that conforms closely to the contours of the animal's form. The tiling follows the curvature of the body, limbs, and head without visible gaps or misalignment. The consistent size and placement of the tiles suggest a deliberate and precise construction, typical of mosaic art. The tiles reflect light evenly, indicating a smooth, polished surface, which aligns with the characteristics of ceramic material. Given the visual evidence and the nature of mosaic craftsmanship, it is reasonable to conclude that the tiles are uniformly sized, glossy, and properly aligned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The eyes of the animal in Image B are clearly formed from individual tiles. The white sclera and black pupils are distinct and precisely shaped using smaller tiles to create a circular appearance. The positioning of the eyes relative to the snout and head matches the original form seen in Image A (a knitted tiger), maintaining symmetry and proportion. The tile work around the eyes is seamless, with no distortion or misalignment, suggesting careful attention to detail. The use of contrasting colors (white and black) ensures clarity and definition, preserving the original eye structure while adapting it to the mosaic medium. Therefore, the eyes maintain their original size and position, and the tile composition accurately reflects the intended design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The stripes across the body of the animal in Image B are created using alternating rows of vibrant orange and deep black tiles. These stripes maintain consistent width and spacing throughout the body, following the natural flow of the animal’s form. The transitions between orange and black tiles are sharp and clean, with no blurring or irregularities. The pattern mirrors the original striped design seen in Image A (the knitted tiger), but adapted into a mosaic format. The uniformity of the tile arrangement ensures that the stripe pattern remains coherent and visually accurate. There are no noticeable deviations in spacing or width, indicating a high level of precision in the tiling process. Thus, the stripes are both uniform and well-aligned with the original pattern.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The surface beneath the animal in Image B is a textured sandy platform, clearly visible as a raised block of sand. The granular detail of the sand is evident, with individual grains discernible under the lighting. There are subtle variations in moisture and coloration across the surface, suggesting natural conditions such as dampness near the waterline. This contrasts sharply with the smooth, reflective surface of the mosaic tiles on the animal, creating a tactile difference between the two materials. The sand appears compacted yet porous, typical of beach environments, and the lighting enhances the texture, casting soft shadows that emphasize its unevenness. This detailed rendering supports the conclusion that the surface is a realistic representation of a sandy platform with granular detail and moisture variation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The limbs and joints of the animal in Image B are smoothly contoured, with no jagged edges or distorted shapes. Each limb is composed of tiles that follow the natural curvature of the animal’s anatomy, ensuring a fluid transition between segments. The joints, such as the elbows and knees, are rounded and well-defined, with tiles carefully placed to maintain continuity and structural integrity. There are no missing tiles or gaps that would suggest rendering errors or incomplete assembly. The overall shape of the limbs is consistent with the original form seen in Image A, but adapted to the mosaic medium without compromising proportions or symmetry. The smoothness of the contours indicates a high-quality execution of the mosaic technique, free from structural inconsistencies.",
    "answer": "Yes"
