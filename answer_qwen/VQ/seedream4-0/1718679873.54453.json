      "question": "Does the miniature robot model retain accurate proportions and intact geometric shapes compared to the original robot, with no visible stretching, compression, or misaligned joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the miniature robot model is displayed within a spherical glass case. Observing its structure, the proportions of the limbs, torso, and head appear consistent with typical mecha design principles—symmetrical and balanced. The joints (shoulders, elbows, hips, knees) are clearly defined and aligned in a way that suggests mechanical articulation without distortion. There is no visual evidence of stretching or compression; for example, the legs maintain their relative length and width compared to the body, and the arms are proportionally scaled. The angular geometry of the armor plating matches expected mechanical design patterns, with sharp edges and clean panel lines. Based on world knowledge of scale models and 3D rendering standards, such fidelity implies careful preservation of the original form. A comparison with Image A reveals that the full-scale robot has identical structural features—same joint placement, limb ratios, and overall silhouette—confirming that the miniature retains accurate proportions. No visible warping or deformation is present in either image, supporting the conclusion that the model is faithfully reproduced.",

      "question": "Is the circular display case transparent and smooth, with natural light interaction and no jagged edges, double outlines, or artificial artifacts around its surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular display case in Image B is rendered with high visual fidelity. Its surface appears uniformly transparent, allowing clear visibility of the robot inside. Light interacts naturally with the glass—reflections and subtle refractions are visible, especially along the curved edges, which mimic real-world optical behavior. The curvature of the sphere is smooth, with no pixelation, jagged edges, or aliasing artifacts. There are no double outlines or ghosting effects around the perimeter, which would suggest rendering errors. Additionally, the reflection of the sky and surrounding environment on the glass surface is soft and continuous, indicating a polished, seamless surface. From a technical standpoint, such clarity and realistic lighting suggest advanced rendering techniques were used. Comparing this to Image A, where there is no display case, we can infer that the absence of any artifact in Image B is intentional and well-executed. Thus, the display case meets all criteria for realism and quality.",

      "question": "Are the tiny gears visible under transparent panels correctly aligned with the robot’s surface, uniformly detailed, and free from overlapping or floating anomalies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Within the spherical display case, several transparent panels reveal internal gear mechanisms behind the robot. These gears are positioned symmetrically around the inner circumference of the sphere, suggesting they are part of a conceptual or decorative internal system. Each gear is individually detailed with teeth and shafts, and they appear to be mounted flush against the inner surface of the sphere. There is no overlap between gears, nor do they float unnaturally in space—they are anchored to their respective panels. Their alignment follows a radial pattern that complements the robot's stance, enhancing the sense of mechanical harmony. From a design perspective, such elements are often used in concept art to imply internal mechanics, even if not functionally accurate. Importantly, the gears do not intersect with the robot’s body or each other, avoiding visual clutter or physical impossibility. Given the precision of the rest of the scene, these gears are rendered consistently and logically. Therefore, they are correctly aligned, uniformly detailed, and free from anomalies.",

      "question": "Is the hexagonal base geometrically precise, with uniform edges and a consistent matte-black finish, and does the model number text appear sharp and evenly glowing without haloing or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base beneath the spherical display is hexagonal in shape, with clean, straight edges and symmetrical facets. The geometry is precise, showing no warping or irregularities, which indicates careful modeling. The surface has a consistent matte-black finish, with no glossy spots or texture inconsistencies. This finish helps emphasize the illuminated text '1020' at the center. The text itself glows with a soft, white light that is evenly distributed across all digits. There is no haloing (glow spreading beyond the letters), no blurring, and no pixelation, suggesting high-resolution rendering. The glow appears to originate from within the base, casting a subtle illumination on the surrounding surface, which adds depth without distorting the numbers. In terms of world knowledge, such presentation is typical of futuristic or sci-fi product displays, where clarity and aesthetic precision are paramount. Compared to Image A, which lacks any such base or text, the presence here is an intentional design choice that is executed flawlessly. Thus, both the base and the text meet all specified criteria.",

      "question": "Does the mini landscape surrounding the display include naturally scaled trees, ground textures, and distant cityscape elements that maintain spatial consistency with the size of the display case and model?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The landscape surrounding the display case in Image B includes small trees, rocky terrain, and a distant city skyline. The trees are proportionally smaller than the display case, which is reasonable given that the entire setup is designed as a miniature exhibit. The ground texture consists of dirt, grass, and rocks, all rendered with appropriate detail for a micro-scale environment. The cityscape in the background is significantly smaller than the display case but maintains a plausible horizon line and atmospheric perspective—fog and haze reduce detail appropriately with distance. Spatially, the elements are consistent: the trees near the base are slightly larger than those farther away, following linear perspective rules. The display case itself appears to be about 1–2 meters tall based on the scale of nearby foliage, which aligns with the size of the robot model inside. The distant city buildings, while stylized, are not disproportionately large or small relative to the foreground elements. This consistency suggests a carefully constructed diorama that respects real-world scaling principles. While not perfectly photorealistic, the scene adheres to logical spatial relationships. Therefore, the mini landscape maintains spatial consistency with the display and model.",
