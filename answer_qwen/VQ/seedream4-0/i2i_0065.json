      "question": "Does the glass display case appear transparent and free of unnatural textures or distortions that would make it look artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass display case in Image B appears to be transparent, with reflections and subtle refractions visible on its surfaces, consistent with real glass. The reflections are soft and diffuse, matching typical lighting conditions in a museum setting, such as ceiling spotlights. There are no obvious pixelation, jagged lines, or unnatural textures that would suggest digital artifacts. The edges of the glass are clean and sharp, and the way light interacts with the glass (e.g., faint reflections and slight distortion at corners) aligns with physical optics. This suggests the glass is rendered realistically, without artificial distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the light focused on the dog’s face well-integrated with the environment, without introducing noticeable shadows or highlights that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting on the dog's face in Image B is soft and directional, likely simulating overhead museum lighting. It creates gentle highlights on the forehead, nose, and cheeks, which are consistent with natural illumination from above. Shadows are present under the chin and around the eyes but are smooth and anatomically plausible. There are no harsh glares or over-saturated areas that would indicate poor integration. The ambient lighting in the background matches the brightness level of the exhibit, suggesting a cohesive lighting setup. This indicates that the lighting is well-integrated and does not disrupt the realism of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the dog remain proportionally consistent within the new museum exhibit setup, avoiding any distortion or deformation in its physical structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is a sculpted bust, not a live animal, so its proportions are based on artistic representation rather than biological accuracy. However, the facial features—such as the placement of the eyes, ears, and snout—are anatomically consistent with an American Staffordshire Terrier. The head size relative to the neck and body portion is appropriate for a dog bust of this breed. There are no signs of stretching, compression, or warping that would suggest digital distortion. The symmetry and structural integrity of the sculpture appear accurate, indicating that the dog remains proportionally consistent within the context of the exhibit.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the informational label about the breed and story appear naturally placed, with no jagged edges or abrupt transitions that suggest poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The informational label in Image B is positioned on a wooden base beneath the dog bust, consistent with standard museum display practices. The text is legible and aligned with the exhibit's theme. The edges of the label are smooth and uniform, with no pixelation or jagged lines. The shadow cast by the label is soft and consistent with the lighting direction, suggesting realistic depth. The transition between the label and the base is seamless, with no color or texture mismatches. These details indicate that the label has been integrated naturally into the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the dog, such as fur texture and facial expression, maintained with clarity and authenticity, without becoming overly smoothed or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is a sculpture, not a photograph of a real animal, so it does not have actual fur but rather a textured surface meant to simulate it. The surface shows fine detailing, such as small pits and ridges around the muzzle, which mimic pores or fur patterns. The eyes are glossy and detailed, with visible reflections that enhance realism. The facial expression is lifelike, with subtle contours around the mouth and eyes suggesting calmness. There is no evidence of blurring, smoothing, or pixelation; instead, the texture appears intentional and well-rendered. Given that this is a sculpted piece, the level of detail is appropriate and authentic for a museum exhibit.",
