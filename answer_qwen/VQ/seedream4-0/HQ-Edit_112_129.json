      "question": "Does the glass dome have natural transparency and refraction effects that match the lighting direction and shadow patterns from the window, without visible artifacts such as uneven edges or unrealistic glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to be a transparent, arched structure enclosing the teapot. The lighting comes from a window in the background, casting soft, directional light and distinct shadows on the wooden surface below. The dome shows subtle refraction effects—such as slight bending of light around its curved surface—and the edges are smooth and well-defined, without jagged or pixelated lines. There is no evidence of artificial glare or harsh reflections that would suggest digital artifacting. Instead, the dome subtly distorts the background window pattern, consistent with how light behaves when passing through curved glass. Additionally, the shadow cast by the dome aligns logically with the light source, indicating proper depth and volume. These visual cues suggest realistic rendering of transparency and refraction. Based on world knowledge, real glass domes do refract light and soften shadows, and this image adheres to those physical principles.",

      "question": "Is the vintage wooden base visually consistent in color, texture, and grain pattern with the surrounding wooden table, and does the velvet lining appear soft and layered without pixelation or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden base beneath the glass dome has a dark brown tone with visible wood grain, similar in style and texture to the wooden table it rests upon. However, closer inspection reveals that the base has a slightly more polished and uniform finish than the table, which exhibits natural wear, knots, and variation in grain. While both surfaces are made of wood, the base's grain appears somewhat idealized and less naturally irregular, suggesting digital enhancement. The velvet lining inside the dome is rendered in a muted pinkish-brown hue and displays a soft, plush texture with gentle folds and layering. It lacks any obvious pixelation or overly reflective shine, and the way light interacts with it (diffuse reflection) suggests a realistic fabric simulation. Overall, while the base’s texture is not perfectly matched to the table, the velvet appears convincingly soft and lifelike. Given that the base is likely meant to be a display stand rather than part of the original table, some discrepancy in texture is acceptable. But strict consistency in wood appearance is not fully achieved.",

      "question": "Do the flowering plants and ferns emerging from the spout and lid grow in a way that follows natural botanical form and maintains contact with the teapot's surface without floating or breaking geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The flowering plants and ferns sprouting from the spout and lid of the teapot exhibit realistic botanical forms—delicate stems, natural leaf shapes, and small blossoms. The growth direction appears organic, with stems curving gently upward and outward. Crucially, the plants seem to emerge directly from the metal surface of the teapot, maintaining physical continuity; there are no floating elements or gaps between the plant bases and the teapot. The leaves and flowers appear anchored at points where they logically could grow from a porous or decorative opening. From a botanical perspective, while actual plants cannot grow from solid metal, the artistic interpretation here is plausible within a surreal or symbolic context. The integration respects spatial logic—the plants follow gravity and curvature of the surface—without violating geometric rules. This suggests careful design to maintain realism even in an imaginative setting.",

      "question": "Are the butterflies positioned at plausible flight heights and angles near the floral engravings, with visible wings and body details that match the scale and lighting of the scene, and do they cast subtle shadows on the teapot surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Two butterflies are visible in the scene—one near the top right of the dome and another slightly lower, closer to the ferns. Their positioning appears natural: one is mid-flight above the foliage, the other gliding near the plant stems. The angles of their wings suggest motion consistent with fluttering flight. Both butterflies show detailed wing patterns and body segmentation appropriate for their size relative to the teapot and plants. The lighting casts soft, faint shadows beneath them onto the teapot and glass dome, which enhances their three-dimensionality and confirms they are not simply pasted on. These shadows are subtle but present, matching the direction of the window light. In terms of scale, the butterflies are proportionally accurate compared to the surrounding flora. Realistic butterfly behavior and lighting interaction are observed, supporting the authenticity of their presence in the composition.",

      "question": "Are all newly added elements rendered in muted earth tones that blend seamlessly with the original silver teapot and wooden background, avoiding bright or jarring color contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The newly added elements in Image B include the glass dome, wooden base, velvet lining, flowering plants, ferns, and butterflies. The plants and ferns are rendered in soft greens and pale pinks, which are muted and harmonious with the warm browns of the wood and the metallic gray of the teapot. The butterflies feature earthy orange and brown tones with delicate patterning, fitting within the overall palette. The velvet lining is a dusty rose or mauve tone, which complements the scene without drawing undue attention. The glass dome is transparent and neutral, not introducing any chromatic aberration or color distortion. All these additions use colors that avoid high saturation or sudden contrast, ensuring visual cohesion. Even though the teapot itself is silver, the surrounding elements are carefully chosen to balance cool and warm tones, creating a unified aesthetic. This indicates intentional color harmony typical of high-quality digital art.",
