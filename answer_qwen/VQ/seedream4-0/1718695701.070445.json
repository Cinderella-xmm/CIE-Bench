      "question": "Are the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers preserved in shape and position after conversion to bronze, without visible distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features such as the nose, mouth, and whiskers appear to be well-preserved in shape and position. The nose retains its rounded form, the mouth is open with visible teeth, and the whiskers are detailed and extend naturally from the cheeks. These features are consistent with what one would expect from a bronze sculpture that aims to maintain the original details of the subject. There is no visible distortion or loss of detail that would suggest otherwise.",

      "question": "Is the bronze helmet properly scaled and positioned on the head, with smooth transitions at the edges and no visible gaps or misalignments with the skull?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze helmet in Image B appears properly scaled and positioned on the head. It fits snugly, with smooth transitions at the edges where it meets the skull. There are no visible gaps or misalignments that would indicate poor fitting. The ornate design on the helmet also suggests careful placement to ensure it aligns correctly with the head's contours.",

      "question": "Do the bronze-framed glasses sit correctly over the eyes without shifting or overlapping incorrectly, and do the lenses show realistic glass-like reflection and transparency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bronze-framed glasses in Image B sit correctly over the eyes without any noticeable shifting or incorrect overlapping. The frames follow the natural curve of the face, and the lenses exhibit a reflective quality typical of glass-like materials. This reflection adds realism, suggesting that the transparency and light interaction were considered in the design.",

      "question": "Does the bronze sweater maintain the original shape and shoulder strap placement, with engraved lines that follow the contours of the garment without breaking or appearing artificial?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There is no bronze sweater present in Image B; instead, the figure is depicted as a bust without clothing below the neck. Therefore, there is no comparison to be made regarding the preservation of a sweater's shape or shoulder strap placement. The question is not applicable to this image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the marble base positioned directly beneath the sculpture, with appropriate contact points and no visible gap between the feet and the base, and is it proportionally sized to support the figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble base in Image B is positioned directly beneath the sculpture, providing appropriate contact points for support. There is no visible gap between the bottom of the sculpture and the base, indicating a stable and proportional relationship. The size of the base seems adequate to support the weight and proportions of the figure above it.",
