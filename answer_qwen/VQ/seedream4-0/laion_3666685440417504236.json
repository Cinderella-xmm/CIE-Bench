      "question": "Are the dome, minaret, and arches inside the globe proportionally accurate and geometrically intact, with no warped edges or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the architectural elements such as the dome, minaret, and arches appear to be contained within a spherical globe. The proportions of these structures seem consistent with their original design, maintaining their geometric integrity without visible warping or broken lines. This conclusion is drawn from observing that the shapes retain their symmetry and alignment despite being placed in a curved environment. The curvature of the globe does not distort the architecture significantly.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the palm trees and cobblestone path inside the globe appear at a consistent scale with the architecture and follow a plausible layout leading to the entrance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees and cobblestone path in Image B are positioned around the building and lead towards the entrance, creating a logical pathway. The scale of the palm trees relative to the architecture appears consistent, suggesting they were intentionally designed to complement the scene. The cobblestone path follows a natural progression toward the entrance, enhancing the realism of the miniature setting.",

      "question": "Are the Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe continuous, evenly spaced, and stylistically consistent with the tilework seen on the original building?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Persian patterns on the exterior of the globe in Image B exhibit continuity and even spacing, reflecting traditional Persian art styles. These patterns align well with the ornate tilework observed on the original building in Image A. The consistency suggests an intentional effort to harmonize the globe's exterior with the building's aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the golden highlights on the dome and arches applied in a way that follows natural light interaction, with no flat, overly bright, or artificially drawn lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden highlights on the dome and arches in Image B appear to interact naturally with the light, giving a sense of depth and dimension. There are no signs of flat or overly bright areas that would suggest artificial drawing. The highlights enhance the three-dimensional appearance of the structures, contributing to the overall realism of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the boundary between the interior scene and the globeâ€™s surface clean and free of jagged edges, transparency glitches, or unnatural reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boundary between the interior scene and the globe's surface in Image B is smooth and clean, with no visible jagged edges or transparency issues. The reflections on the globe's surface are subtle and natural, adding to the illusion of a transparent sphere containing the miniature scene. This careful attention to detail ensures a seamless integration of the scene within the globe.",
