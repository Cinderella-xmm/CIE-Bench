    "Question": "Q1: Do the proportions of the shirt and tie appear natural and appropriate for the baby's body size?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the baby is wearing a red dress shirt with a striped tie. The shirt appears to be tailored to fit the baby’s small frame, with sleeves that end just above the wrists and a collar that fits snugly around the neck. The tie is proportionally sized relative to the baby’s torso—while ties are typically longer on adults, this one is shortened appropriately for a child, maintaining a realistic appearance. The width of the tie is consistent with typical children's formal wear. Given that babies often wear scaled-down versions of adult clothing, the proportions seem reasonable and aligned with common practices in infant formal attire. There is no visual indication of oversized or undersized elements that would suggest unnatural scaling.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the textures of the shirt and tie smooth and consistent with typical fabric materials?",
    "explanation": "The shirt in Image B exhibits a smooth, slightly matte texture consistent with cotton or a cotton-blend fabric commonly used in children’s clothing. The lighting highlights subtle folds and creases in a way that suggests real fabric behavior under gravity and movement. The tie has a diagonal striped pattern with alternating colors (red, black, and possibly navy), and its surface appears slightly glossy, which is typical of silk or satin-like materials used in ties. There are no visible pixelation, unnatural sharpness, or texture repetition that would indicate digital artifacts. The overall rendering of both garments aligns well with expected textile properties, suggesting high-quality image editing or photography.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the baby's hands holding the glasses appear anatomically correct and free from distortion?",
    "explanation": "The baby’s hands in Image B are shown gripping a pair of round-framed glasses. Each hand has five fingers, with thumbs positioned correctly on one side of the glasses and fingers curled naturally around the arms. The joints and curvature of the fingers appear proportionate and consistent with infant anatomy. There is no visible warping, stretching, or misalignment of fingers or knuckles. The grip is symmetrical and realistic for a baby’s motor skills at this stage. While infants may not have full dexterity, the pose is plausible given their developmental capabilities. No signs of digital manipulation such as floating fingers or unnatural bending are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the baby's posture and the way the clothes drape over the body look natural and believable?",
    "explanation": "The baby is seated upright on a couch with legs bent outward, a common position for infants who are learning to sit independently. The spine appears straight but relaxed, and the head is held up steadily, indicating good muscle control typical of a 6–9 month-old baby. The clothing drapes naturally: the shirt shows slight wrinkling at the shoulders and across the chest due to the baby’s movements, and the pants gather gently around the thighs and knees. The fabric does not appear to be stretched unnaturally or pulled tight in ways that suggest forced positioning. The overall posture and garment behavior are consistent with real-world observations of babies dressed formally and sitting unassisted.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are there any visible seams, edges, or inconsistencies where the clothing appears to be edited onto the baby?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, there are no obvious signs of digital editing such as harsh outlines, color mismatches, or shadow discrepancies along the edges of the clothing. The shirt collar blends seamlessly with the skin tone, and the sleeves transition smoothly into the arms without any jagged lines or unnatural lighting effects. The tie sits properly against the shirt without floating or clipping errors. Shadows cast by the clothing match the ambient light source, and the fabric folds align logically with the body shape. There is no evidence of double edges, transparency artifacts, or ghosting that would indicate post-production overlaying. The integration of the clothing appears seamless and photorealistic.",
    "answer": "No"
