      "question": "Does the red dress maintain natural fabric folds and surface texture despite increased saturation and bold outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red dress is rendered with a stylized, comic-book-like aesthetic featuring bold black outlines and heightened color saturation. While the overall shape of the dress is preserved, the fabric folds appear exaggerated and simplified compared to realistic draping. The texture lacks fine detail such as subtle creases or fabric grain that would be expected in real-world materials like velvet or satin. Instead, the folds are represented by sharp, angular lines that prioritize graphic clarity over physical realism. This suggests that while the general silhouette is maintained, the natural fabric behavior—such as soft gradients in shadow and light across folds—is compromised due to the stylization. Therefore, the surface texture and fold dynamics do not reflect natural fabric physics.",

      "question": "Are the woman’s leg and arm positions consistent with natural human biomechanics during a walking motion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman in Image B is depicted mid-stride, with her right leg forward and left leg trailing, which aligns with a typical walking gait. Her right arm is slightly bent and swinging backward, while her left arm is extended forward, matching the natural counterbalance mechanism of human locomotion. The knee flexion and hip rotation appear anatomically plausible for a walking posture. Additionally, the angle of her torso and head orientation supports a balanced, dynamic movement. These elements collectively suggest that her limb positioning adheres to basic principles of human biomechanics. Even though the image uses stylized rendering, the underlying pose remains physically coherent.",

      "question": "Is the black slipcase visually integrated into the scene with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the surrounding environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black slipcase in Image B is placed on a neutral white background, separate from the illustrated scene of the woman in the city. It does not share the same environmental lighting conditions as the artwork; instead, it appears under even, diffused studio lighting. The shadows cast by the slipcase are soft and directional, suggesting a controlled indoor setup, whereas the illustration behind it features dramatic neon reflections and wet pavement lighting typical of a nighttime urban setting. There is no visual continuity between the lighting on the slipcase and the illustrated world—it exists as a product display rather than being embedded within the scene. Thus, the slipcase is not integrated into the illustrated environment but presented alongside it as a physical object in a different context.",

      "question": "Do the bold outlines around the woman’s body follow the natural contours of her shape without creating gaps or overlapping incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold outlines in Image B are clearly defined and trace the outer edges of the woman’s form, including her limbs, torso, and clothing. The lines closely follow the curvature of her body, particularly around the shoulders, waist, and thighs, maintaining alignment with anatomical proportions. There are no visible gaps between segments (e.g., at joints), nor are there instances where outlines overlap improperly—such as crossing over themselves or misaligning with the underlying figure. The outline treatment is clean and consistent, suggesting careful digital drafting. While stylized, the outlines preserve the integrity of the figure’s silhouette and do not introduce distortions that would compromise perceived form.",

      "question": "Does the woman’s right hand have five fingers with natural proportions and smooth skin texture, without deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the woman’s right hand in Image B, the hand is depicted with five distinct fingers, each with appropriate length and width ratios consistent with human anatomy. The thumb is positioned correctly relative to the other fingers, and there are no extra digits or missing ones. The skin texture is simplified due to the illustrative style, lacking fine details like pores or wrinkles, but this is typical of cartoon or comic art. However, the proportions and spacing of the fingers remain accurate, and there is no indication of deformation such as fusion, elongation, or asymmetry. The hand maintains a recognizable and proportionate human form despite the stylization.",
