    "Question": "Q1: Are the sails rendered as smooth, polished walnut with visible and consistent grain patterns that mimic real wood, without artificial sheen or texture repetition?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the sails are clearly made of a material resembling polished walnut wood, with visible grain patterns running vertically across their surfaces. These patterns appear consistent and natural, mimicking the way wood grain typically flows in real timber. The texture is not overly repetitive, which would suggest digital tiling, and there is no excessive artificial sheen—instead, the light reflects softly, suggesting a realistic matte-to-satin finish. This aligns with common knowledge about high-quality wooden models where sails might be crafted from thin, stained wood panels to simulate fabric while maintaining structural integrity. The lighting conditions (a sunset) enhance subtle variations in reflectivity, further supporting the realism. Therefore, based on visual cues and world knowledge of craftsmanship in wooden ship models, the sails appear to be realistically rendered.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the hull display deep, textured carvings that resemble individual walnut planks with natural variations in thickness and spacing, preserving the original boat’s silhouette without distortion?",
    "explanation": "The hull in Image B shows intricate detailing, including carved patterns along its lower edge that resemble traditional shipbuilding techniques such as plank construction. These carvings are deep and have varying thicknesses and spacing, which contributes to a sense of authenticity. The wood grain is consistent with walnut, and the planking appears to follow the natural curvature of the hull, maintaining the original silhouette of the boat. There is no visible distortion—such as stretching or warping—that would suggest digital manipulation. The craftsmanship reflects known practices in model-making, where attention to detail ensures proportionality and historical accuracy. Thus, combining visual evidence with knowledge of fine wooden ship models, the hull's design meets the criteria described.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the boat positioned on a sleek, pale beige pedestal that is properly grounded and aligned with the boat’s base, without appearing to float or disconnect from the surface?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat rests on a clean, rectangular pedestal that is pale beige in color. The base of the boat is fully supported by the platform, and there is clear contact between the two surfaces. The alignment is precise—the boat sits level and centered, with no visual indication of floating or misalignment. Shadows and reflections beneath the boat suggest it is firmly grounded, and the perspective supports this conclusion. In real-world display contexts, museum-style pedestals are designed for stability and proper support, which matches what is shown here. No digital artifacts or floating effects are present, indicating careful rendering or photography. Therefore, based on visual grounding cues and standard display practices, the boat is correctly positioned.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the wood tones across the sails and hull show natural variation in color and reflectivity under the ambient light, without uniformity or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "The wood tones in Image B vary subtly across both the sails and the hull. The sails exhibit darker and lighter areas due to the grain and angle of light, especially near the edges where shadows deepen. Similarly, the hull has gradations in color—warmer tones where light hits directly and cooler shadows in recessed areas. These variations are consistent with how real wood interacts with ambient light during a sunset. There are no flat, uniformly colored sections or overly bright, unrealistic highlights that would suggest poor rendering. Instead, the reflectivity is soft and diffuse, typical of polished walnut under low-angle sunlight. This aligns with expectations from physical materials and lighting physics, confirming naturalistic tonal variation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are all structural elements such as the mast, rigging, and deck preserved in correct alignment and proportion relative to each other, without stretching, bending, or missing parts?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the mast stands straight and vertical, properly aligned with the center of the boat. The rigging lines extend logically from the mast to various points on the hull and sails, showing correct tension and spatial relationships. The deck features railings, windows, and a cabin structure that are proportionally scaled and symmetrically placed. There is no visible stretching, bending, or deformation of any component. All parts appear intact and structurally coherent. This fidelity to form is consistent with high-quality model craftsmanship, where precision is essential. Comparing to known historical vessels, the proportions match those of traditional sailing boats. Thus, based on visual analysis and structural knowledge of maritime models, all elements are correctly represented.",
    "answer": "Yes"
