      "question": "Do the shoes appear naturally larger without any visible distortion or unnatural stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shoes appear to be naturally larger without any visible distortion or unnatural stretching. The proportions of the shoes relative to the legs and the cloud shelf seem consistent with a realistic scale. There are no signs of warping or disproportionate elements that would suggest artificial enlargement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the legs depicted in a cartoon-like style while retaining natural textures and avoiding unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs in Image B are depicted in a cartoon-like style, characterized by smooth, rounded shapes and simplified textures. However, they retain natural textures through the use of shading and highlights that mimic real-world lighting effects. There are no unnatural artifacts present, suggesting a careful design process.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the feet on the cloud-shaped shelf look natural and structurally sound, without any floating or disconnected appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the feet on the cloud-shaped shelf in Image B appears natural and structurally sound. The feet are firmly placed on the shelf, and there is no indication of floating or disconnection. The alignment of the legs and feet suggests a stable stance, which is visually credible.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the overall composition, including the interaction between the shoes, legs, and clouds, visually credible and free from distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B, including the interaction between the shoes, legs, and clouds, is visually credible and free from distortions. The elements are well-integrated, with appropriate scaling and positioning that contribute to a harmonious scene. The interaction between these components appears intentional and well-executed.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the textures and fine details of the shoes and legs been preserved, avoiding any unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textures and fine details of the shoes and legs in Image B have been preserved effectively. The shoes exhibit detailed stitching and material texture, while the legs show subtle shading and highlights that enhance their three-dimensional appearance. There are no noticeable unnatural textures or loss of details, indicating high-quality rendering.",
