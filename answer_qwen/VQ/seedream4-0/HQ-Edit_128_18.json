      "question": "Are the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves with consistent shading and no jagged edges or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the green foliage motifs surrounding the giraffe are composed of smooth, organically shaped leaves. The shading appears consistent, and there are no visible jagged edges or pixelation. This is inferred from the clean lines and uniform color gradients on the leaves, which align with how digital illustrations typically represent natural elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the animal footprints on the floor follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room, with consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal footprints on the floor in Image B follow a logical path from the giraffe toward the edge of the room. They exhibit consistent depth and spacing that matches typical animal gait patterns. This conclusion is drawn from observing the regular intervals and alignment of the footprints, which suggest a natural walking motion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the clear packaging around each plush toy transparent with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toy’s shape beneath, consistent with real plastic wrap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clear packaging around each plush toy in Image B is transparent, with visible surface highlights and subtle distortion of the toy’s shape beneath. These features are consistent with real plastic wrap, as the reflections and slight warping of the toys' shapes mimic the behavior of light passing through and interacting with a semi-transparent material.",

      "question": "Are the colorful letters on the wall aligned properly with the wall surface, showing no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colorful letters on the wall in Image B are aligned properly with the wall surface, showing no gaps, blurring, or inconsistent font scaling. Each letter appears sharp and evenly spaced, suggesting careful placement and design to maintain visual coherence and readability.",

      "question": "Does the giraffe retain its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The giraffe in Image B retains its original body proportions and soft fabric texture, with no stretching, flattening, or unnatural seams introduced during the transformation. Its appearance remains consistent with a plush toy's characteristics, maintaining realistic fabric details and proportions.",
