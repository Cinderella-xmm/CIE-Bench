    "Question": "Q1: Does the surface of the mannequin's body exhibit a consistent weathered stone texture throughout, without patches of remaining metallic sheen or abrupt material changes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mannequin appears to be rendered as a stone sculpture, with a textured surface resembling aged stone. The skin tone is uniformly light grayish-beige, typical of carved sandstone or marble, and there are visible textural details such as fine grain patterns and subtle erosion marks across the arms, torso, and legs. These features suggest intentional weathering effects consistent with ancient stone statues. There are no visible patches of metallic sheen or reflective surfaces—unlike in Image A, where the mannequin has a polished metallic finish. The transition from one part of the body to another is smooth and continuous in texture, with no abrupt shifts between materials. This consistency supports the conclusion that the entire body has been uniformly transformed into a stone-like material.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral and paisley patterns on the saree clearly visible as raised carvings on the stone surface, maintaining their original shape, symmetry, and spatial arrangement without blurring or geometric deformation?",
    "explanation": "The saree in Image B displays intricate designs that closely resemble traditional Indian motifs such as floral and paisley patterns. These patterns are not merely painted or superimposed but appear as three-dimensional reliefs carved into the stone surface. The depth and definition of the carvings are evident through shadows and highlights, indicating raised elements. The symmetry and alignment of these patterns along the border and body of the saree remain consistent with classical Indian textile art, and there is no visible blurring or distortion. The spacing between motifs is uniform, and the overall composition maintains its integrity. Comparing this to Image A, where the patterns are embroidered or woven fabric textures, the transformation in Image B successfully converts the design into sculpted relief while preserving its original layout and proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the mannequin’s pose proportionally correct and structurally stable, with limbs positioned in a way that aligns with classical Indian sculpture conventions (e.g., slight tilt of head, bent elbow, relaxed hand placement) without unnatural bending or floating limbs?",
    "explanation": "The pose of the figure in Image B reflects characteristics commonly found in classical Indian sculptures, particularly those from Gupta or Chola periods. The head is slightly tilted downward, the left arm is bent at the elbow with the hand resting gently against the hip, and the right arm hangs naturally by the side. These gestures align with traditional representations of grace and serenity in Indian art. The posture is balanced and grounded, with the feet firmly planted on a base, suggesting structural stability. There are no signs of floating limbs or exaggerated angles. While the figure is stylized, the proportions of the limbs and torso are harmonious and anatomically plausible within the context of sculptural representation. Unlike the rigid, modern stance of the mannequin in Image A, this version adopts a more fluid, culturally informed pose.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the necklace and bangle rendered as three-dimensional stone carvings with defined edges and depth, matching their original positions and proportions, and free from ghosting or misplaced elements?",
    "explanation": "The jewelry in Image B—the necklace and bangles—are depicted as integral parts of the stone sculpture. They are not flat or superficially added but instead show clear depth, rounded forms, and defined edges consistent with carved stone. The necklace consists of multiple strands, each with individual beads that have distinct shapes and spacing, indicating careful craftsmanship. Similarly, the bangles on both wrists are thick and circular, with visible thickness and shadowing that confirm their three-dimensionality. Their placement matches the original positioning seen in Image A, and there are no visual artifacts such as ghosting, transparency, or misalignment. The integration of these accessories into the stone medium is seamless, maintaining both scale and aesthetic coherence with the rest of the sculpture.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the folds of the saree and contours of the body show subtle signs of weathering such as surface pitting, uneven texture, and shadowed crevices, without distorting the overall shape or creating artificial highlights?",
    "explanation": "The folds of the saree and the contours of the body in Image B display realistic weathering effects typical of ancient stone sculptures. There are small pits, irregularities, and variations in surface texture that simulate natural aging. These imperfections are concentrated in areas prone to wear, such as the edges of folds and under the arms, and they contribute to a sense of authenticity. Shadows in the crevices of the fabric folds are soft and consistent with directional lighting, enhancing the perception of depth without introducing artificial glare or over-sharp highlights. The overall form remains intact—no distortions or exaggerated curves are present. This level of detail suggests a deliberate artistic choice to mimic real-world stone degradation, rather than applying digital enhancements that might disrupt realism. Compared to Image A, where the fabric appears smooth and pristine, Image B’s treatment adds historical texture without compromising structural accuracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
