      "question": "Does the chibi version preserve distinct facial features like hair texture and glasses in a way that remains visually consistent with the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi version simplifies the character's features into a more cartoonish style. The hair is depicted with bold outlines and lacks detailed texture, which is typical for chibi art to emphasize cuteness and simplicity. The glasses are round and prominent, maintaining their iconic shape but without intricate detailing. This simplified representation aligns with common practices in chibi art where distinct features are preserved but stylized.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scarf and the wand being held in the hand rendered with natural textures that match the other elements in the chibi figure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf and wand in Image B are rendered with smooth, solid colors and simple shapes that match the overall chibi aesthetic of the figure. They lack detailed textures that would be expected in a realistic depiction but are consistent with the simplified style used throughout the chibi design. This uniformity suggests that they are intentionally designed to fit within the chibi theme.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand holding the wand proportionate with the rest of the chibi figure's body, and does it look anatomically plausible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the wand in Image B appears disproportionately large compared to the chibi figure's body, which is a common stylistic choice in chibi art to add emphasis or humor. However, from an anatomical perspective, it does not look plausible as it seems oversized relative to the small figure. This exaggeration is part of the chibi style rather than aiming for realism.",

      "model_answer": "No",

      "question": "Does the chibi character blend naturally into the wooden background without any visible artifacts or unnatural shadows that disrupt the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi character in Image B is placed against a wooden background. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural shadows around the character that would disrupt the scene. The lighting appears even, and the edges of the chibi figure are clean, suggesting that it blends naturally into the background without disrupting the visual harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the scarf and tie designed with coherent shapes that do not introduce any broken or distorted geometries, preserving the chibi aesthetic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scarf and tie in Image B are designed with clear, coherent shapes that follow the chibi aesthetic. The scarf has neat stripes and the tie is properly shaped, both contributing to a cohesive look. There are no broken or distorted geometries that would detract from the overall design, ensuring that the chibi style is maintained effectively.",
