      "question": "Is the energy crown at the top of the Eiffel Tower symmetrically aligned with the tower’s central axis and does it cast consistent light without visible rendering artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure at the top of the tower resembles a stylized crown emitting electric-like energy, with glowing blue and purple arcs emanating from its apex. The crown appears to be centered along the vertical axis of the tower, suggesting symmetry in alignment. However, upon closer inspection, the lighting effects—particularly the electric arcs—are unevenly distributed, with some areas appearing brighter or more jagged than others, which may indicate rendering artifacts such as aliasing or inconsistent glow intensity. Additionally, the crown's design is not physically plausible for the original Eiffel Tower, but as a digital creation, its aesthetic symmetry is maintained. While the overall placement is central, the light emission lacks uniformity, with noticeable flickering or over-sharp edges typical of low-resolution or poorly blended lighting effects in digital art. Therefore, while alignment is symmetrical, the light casting shows inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Are the iron lattice girders of the Eiffel Tower preserved in their original geometric configuration, with no signs of bending, stretching, or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The original Eiffel Tower features a precise, repeating lattice framework made of wrought iron, forming triangular trusses that provide structural stability. In Image B, the underlying framework still follows a similar lattice pattern, but it has been reimagined to support a humanoid figure. The girders are clearly distorted to form a torso and limbs, indicating significant bending and stretching. For example, the central column expands outward into arms, which violates the original geometry. Moreover, joints where the limbs connect appear unnaturally fused, lacking the continuity of real ironwork. Some segments seem disconnected or replaced by digital elements (like glowing circuits), suggesting that the original configuration has been fundamentally altered. Thus, while the lattice motif is retained, the structural integrity and original geometric configuration are compromised.",

      "question": "Do the luminescent circuits run continuously along the tower’s surface without floating above it, and do they emit light that blends naturally with the surrounding illumination?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tower is overlaid with glowing circuit-like patterns in cyan and magenta hues. These lines follow the structural contours of the tower, suggesting an attempt to integrate them into the design. However, many of these circuits appear to float slightly above the surface, especially near the edges and corners, creating a sense of depth inconsistency. This floating effect is evident due to subtle shadows or lack of contact with the metallic frame. Furthermore, the emitted light is highly saturated and neon-like, contrasting sharply with the ambient dusk lighting of the scene. Natural illumination in such a setting would diffuse softly across surfaces, but here the glow is artificial and abrupt, with sharp boundaries that do not blend seamlessly into the environment. This suggests poor integration of lighting effects, resulting in a visually jarring appearance.",

      "question": "Are the digital glyphs embedded into the girders without causing visible displacement or deformation of the metal structure beneath them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital glyphs on the tower in Image B are stylized symbols resembling ancient or futuristic script, rendered in bright colors and integrated into the lattice framework. Upon close examination, these glyphs appear to be superimposed onto the girders rather than being physically embedded. There is no evidence of material displacement—such as raised edges or indented surfaces—that would suggest true embedding. Instead, the glyphs seem to hover just above the metal, with no visible interaction between the text and the structural elements. The metal around the glyphs remains smooth and unaltered, indicating that the glyphs are purely graphical overlays. In reality, engraving or embedding such designs would require physical modification, which is not reflected here. Thus, the glyphs do not interact realistically with the underlying structure.",

      "question": "Do the holographic elements appear translucent and layered with depth, and do they avoid intersecting solid parts of the tower or showing pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic elements in Image B include floating digital interfaces and data streams surrounding the base and midsection of the tower. These elements are semi-transparent and display layered visual effects, such as stacked blocks and floating UI panels, which contribute to a sense of depth. However, some of these holograms intersect with solid parts of the tower, particularly near the lower arches and support beams, where the transparent graphics overlap the actual structure. This creates a visual contradiction, as holograms should not obstruct solid objects unless projected through them. Additionally, certain edges of the holographic displays exhibit pixelation or blocky textures, especially when viewed at higher contrast areas, indicating low resolution or compression artifacts. While the concept of layered depth is present, the technical execution includes errors in spatial logic and image quality.",

      "question": "Are the pixelated energy barriers positioned directly around the base of the tower and do they have sharp, consistent edges without blurring or floating above the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "At the base of the tower in Image B, there is a ring of pixelated, block-like energy barriers composed of glowing cubes in shades of blue and purple. These barriers are placed directly on the ground, forming a perimeter around the tower's foundation. The edges of the individual cubes are generally sharp and well-defined, contributing to a clean, digital aesthetic. However, some sections of the barrier appear to float slightly above the grass, particularly where shadows are cast inconsistently. Additionally, the transition between the barrier and the ground lacks seamless integration—there is no visible interaction like reflection or shadow grounding, which would be expected if the barrier were physically present. While most edges are consistent, the floating effect and lack of environmental interaction suggest that the barriers are not fully grounded in the scene, undermining realism despite their sharp appearance.",

      "question": "Are the digital eyes located in a position consistent with the tower’s architecture and do they emit light that casts soft shadows and reflects off adjacent surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The digital eyes in Image B are positioned where the upper face of the humanoid figure would be, roughly aligned with the second level of the tower. Their location is somewhat anatomically plausible given the stylized transformation of the tower into a giant figure. However, the eyes emit intense purple light that appears too harsh and directional, lacking soft diffusion. Shadows cast by the eyes are minimal and do not follow natural lighting rules; instead, they seem to originate from within the eyes themselves without interacting meaningfully with surrounding surfaces. There is no visible reflection of the eye light on nearby metal structures or the ground, which would be expected in a realistic scene. The light source appears flat and artificial, failing to integrate with the ambient lighting. While the placement is roughly consistent with the figure’s head, the lighting behavior is unrealistic.",
