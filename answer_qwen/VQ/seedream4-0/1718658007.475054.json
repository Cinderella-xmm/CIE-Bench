      "question": "Are the pastel colors applied to the octopus uniformly distributed without abrupt color shifts or pixelated edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the octopus is depicted with a gradient of pastel colors that transition smoothly from one shade to another. There are no visible pixelated edges or abrupt color shifts, suggesting a careful application of color blending techniques. The visual cues indicate a uniform distribution of color, which aligns with common practices in digital art for achieving a soft and cohesive look.",

      "question": "Do the brush outlines around the octopus follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles without overlapping or breaking at joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brush outlines around the octopus in Image B follow the natural curves of its body and tentacles closely. There are no overlaps or breaks at the joints, indicating a meticulous attention to detail in the illustration. This adherence to the contours suggests an intention to maintain the integrity of the octopus's form, which is typical in high-quality digital illustrations.",

      "question": "Are the waves near the shore smooth and consistent in shape, showing natural foam patterns without jagged or broken textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The waves near the shore in Image B appear smooth and consistent in shape, with natural foam patterns that suggest gentle movement. There are no jagged or broken textures, which would be inconsistent with the depiction of water. The visual cues align with what one would expect from a serene beach scene, reinforcing the overall aesthetic quality of the image.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B is positioned above the horizon line without intersecting any clouds. It does not cause visible distortion in the background sky, maintaining a clear separation between the text and the scenic elements. This placement ensures readability while preserving the integrity of the background, demonstrating thoughtful design choices.",

      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain align with the direction of the sunset light source and maintain depth perception?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows cast by the octopus and surrounding terrain in Image B align well with the direction of the sunset light source, enhancing depth perception. The shadows are subtle but noticeable, contributing to the three-dimensional effect. This alignment reflects an understanding of lighting principles, ensuring that the scene feels realistic and immersive.",
