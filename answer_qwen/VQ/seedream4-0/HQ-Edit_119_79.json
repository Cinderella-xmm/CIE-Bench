      "question": "Does the cat’s body maintain the original shape and proportions when transformed into quartz and obsidian crystals, with no visible warping or unnatural breaks in form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat's body is composed of quartz and obsidian crystals. The overall shape and proportions appear consistent with a typical cat form, maintaining a natural posture without visible warping or unnatural breaks. The transition from one crystal to another seems smooth, preserving the original structure. This conclusion is drawn by observing the alignment of the crystals and their adherence to the expected contours of a cat.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the emerald crystal eyes positioned correctly within the eye sockets, showing consistent size, shape, and reflective qualities that match the original facial structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald crystal eyes in Image B are positioned within what would be the eye sockets of a cat. They maintain consistent size and shape relative to the facial structure formed by the surrounding crystals. The reflective qualities of the emeralds suggest they are designed to mimic the appearance of cat eyes, fitting naturally into the face. This analysis is based on the visual integration of the eyes with the rest of the crystal composition.",

      "question": "Are the cat’s front paws and hind legs properly positioned on the wooden block, with no floating or disconnected segments that violate physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the front paws and hind legs of the crystal cat are positioned on the wooden block in a manner that aligns with physical logic. There are no floating or disconnected segments; the placement suggests a stable stance. Comparing this with Image A, where the cat's paws naturally rest on the block, the positioning in Image B maintains a similar logical arrangement despite the change in material.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the quartz and obsidian surfaces display realistic textures with natural variations in translucency, shading, and edge definition, without pixelation or unnatural smoothness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quartz and obsidian surfaces in Image B display realistic textures with variations in translucency and shading. The edges of the crystals are well-defined, contributing to a natural look. There is no evidence of pixelation or unnatural smoothness, which supports the conclusion that the textures are rendered realistically. This assessment is based on the visual inspection of the crystal surfaces and their interaction with light.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the wooden block visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting, and does it cast appropriate shadows under the crystal cat without unnatural gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden block in Image B appears visually consistent with the original image in terms of texture, color, and lighting. It casts appropriate shadows under the crystal cat, suggesting a realistic interaction between light and the materials. Comparing it with Image A, the block retains its characteristics, indicating that the transformation of the cat into crystals did not affect the consistency of the block's depiction.",
