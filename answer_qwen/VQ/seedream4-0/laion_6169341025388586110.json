      "question": "Does the statue exhibit a consistent clay-like texture across all body parts, including the face, limbs, and torso, without visible patches of mismatched material or unnatural graininess?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the statue appears to be rendered in a uniform, matte beige tone resembling clay. The surface texture is smooth and cohesive across the face, arms, torso, and legs, with no abrupt transitions or patches that suggest different materials. The subtle variations in shading are consistent with natural lighting on a homogenous material like terracotta or sculpted clay. There is no visible graininess or digital artifacting that would indicate a mismatched texture. This consistency aligns with typical artistic representations of religious statues made from clay or similar materials, especially when displayed under controlled lighting. Therefore, based on visual cues and expectations for such sculptures, the texture appears uniformly clay-like.",

      "question": "Is the glass dome fully transparent with no visible distortion of the statue's shape or features behind it, and does it display natural reflections and refractions consistent with real glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B is highly reflective and shows clear highlights from internal spotlights, which suggests a polished, transparent surface. However, upon closer analysis, there is minimal distortion of the statue’s form—its proportions remain accurate and undistorted through the dome. The reflections on the dome are smooth and follow realistic light behavior, with soft glares and subtle refraction effects around the edges. While the dome has decorative etchings (lotus and wave patterns), these do not interfere with transparency or cause significant optical distortion. Real glass domes can have minor distortions due to curvature, but here they appear negligible. The lighting inside the dome also enhances realism by casting focused beams, mimicking actual illumination within a glass enclosure. Thus, the dome behaves as expected for a high-quality transparent glass structure.",

      "question": "Are the lotus and wave patterns on the glass dome evenly spaced, clearly defined, and integrated smoothly into the surface without overlapping or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The decorative elements on the glass dome include stylized lotus flowers and wave motifs. These patterns are symmetrically placed along the lower half of the dome and appear to be etched or engraved into the glass surface. They are evenly spaced and maintain consistent size and clarity. The lines are clean, without jagged edges or pixelation, suggesting high-resolution rendering. There is no overlap between adjacent patterns, and their integration into the curved surface is seamless, following the contour of the dome naturally. Such designs are common in traditional Indian art and often used in sacred contexts. Given the precision of the artwork and absence of visual artifacts, the patterns are well-executed and harmoniously blended into the dome’s surface.",

      "question": "Do the trident, snake, and drum exhibit enhanced golden highlights under the spotlight without visible halo effects, color bleeding, or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trident, snake, and drum are all depicted in gold and illuminated by overhead spotlights within the dome. The highlights on these objects are bright but controlled, with sharp edges and no noticeable halo effects—common artifacts in poorly processed images where light spills beyond intended boundaries. There is no visible color bleeding (where colors blend unnaturally into surrounding areas), nor are there overexposed regions where details are lost due to excessive brightness. Instead, the metallic sheen appears realistic, with specular reflections that match the direction of the light sources. This level of detail suggests careful post-processing or 3D rendering techniques that preserve material fidelity. The golden tones enhance the divine symbolism associated with Lord Shiva, while maintaining visual integrity.",

      "question": "Are the muscle contours on the statue’s arms, chest, and legs accurately shaded with smooth gradients that follow the underlying anatomy and directional light source?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shading on the statue in Image B follows anatomical logic. The muscles of the arms, chest, and legs show gradual transitions in tone that correspond to the direction of the light source (from above and slightly in front). For example, the biceps and forearms display natural shadowing beneath the curves, and the pectoral muscles are subtly defined with soft gradients rather than harsh lines. The interplay of light and shadow enhances three-dimensionality without exaggeration. These shading patterns are consistent with how light interacts with human-like forms under direct illumination, particularly in indoor settings with focused lighting. The overall effect is lifelike and respectful of both artistic tradition and physical realism.",

      "question": "Are the incense holders positioned at ground level around the base of the pedestal, correctly scaled, and free from floating or clipping against other structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, four small incense holders are arranged symmetrically around the base of the pedestal. They rest firmly on what appears to be a flat surface at ground level, with no signs of floating or being suspended mid-air. Their scale is appropriate relative to the pedestal and the statue—small enough to serve as offerings but large enough to hold incense sticks visibly. There is no clipping (i.e., no part of the incense holders overlaps incorrectly with the pedestal or platform), and their placement is balanced and intentional. In real-world religious setups, such holders are typically placed at ground level for ritual use, and this arrangement adheres to that convention. The shadows beneath them further confirm their grounded position.",
