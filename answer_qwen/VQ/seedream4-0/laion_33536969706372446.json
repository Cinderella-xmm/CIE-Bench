      "question": "Do the deep burgundy drapes hang naturally with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients, and do they cast realistic shadows on the wall and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the deep burgundy drapes appear to hang with smooth folds and consistent shadow gradients. The shadows cast on the wall and floor seem natural, following the direction of the light source from the ceiling. This is analyzed by observing the continuity and softness of the folds, as well as the realistic way the shadows extend from the fabric onto the surrounding surfaces.",

      "question": "Are the gold woodwork details on the bed frame continuous, symmetrical, and free from warped or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold woodwork details on the bed frame in Image B are continuous and symmetrical, showing intricate carvings that align well with each other. There are no visible warped or broken geometric shapes; the design appears cohesive and well-crafted. This conclusion is drawn from examining the uniformity and symmetry of the patterns along the frame.",

      "question": "Do the cherub images on the pillows show visible brushstroke texture, subtle color gradients, and seamless integration into the pillow surface without sharp borders or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cherub images on the pillows in Image B display subtle color gradients and a seamless integration into the pillow surface. There are no sharp borders or pixelation, suggesting high-quality printing or embroidery. The texture appears smooth, contributing to a realistic and detailed appearance.",

      "question": "Do the shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork match the direction of the ceiling light and fall consistently on adjacent walls and floor?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows cast by the new canopy drapes and gold woodwork in Image B match the direction of the ceiling light, falling consistently on adjacent walls and the floor. This is evident from the alignment of the shadows with the light source and their gradual fading as they extend away from the objects casting them.",

      "question": "Is the redesigned canopy bed fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall, and does it maintain a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The redesigned canopy bed in Image B is fully contained within the room boundaries, with no parts extending beyond the ceiling or overlapping the wall. It maintains a realistic scale relative to the nightstand and rug, appearing proportionate and well-integrated into the space. This assessment is based on comparing the size and placement of the bed with other elements in the room.",
