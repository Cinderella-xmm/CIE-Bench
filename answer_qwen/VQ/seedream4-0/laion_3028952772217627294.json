      "question": "Are the stitches on the cactus’s body and sombrero clearly visible, evenly spaced, and consistent with the knitting style of the surrounding elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus is depicted with a knitted texture that includes visible stitches. The body of the cactus shows a pattern of vertical stitches that are relatively uniform in size and spacing, consistent with typical amigurumi or crochet techniques. The sombrero also displays a similar knit texture with horizontal rows of stitches in alternating colors (purple, pink, teal, orange), which appear even and well-defined. These details align with the overall aesthetic of hand-knitted plush toys. Furthermore, the stitching style on the cactus and its hat matches the visual language of the pot and the donkey's striped pattern, suggesting consistency across all knitted elements. There is no evidence of irregularities such as uneven tension or misaligned stitches. Thus, based on visual analysis and common knowledge of textile crafts, the stitches appear to be clearly visible, evenly spaced, and consistent with the knitting style.",

      "question": "Do the mane and striped pattern on the donkey display natural yarn-like texture and proper alignment without visible distortions or gaps between stitches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The donkey in Image B has a mane made of black yarn tufts that appear fluffy and textured, resembling real yarn strands rather than flat or digitally rendered hair. This gives it a natural, tactile appearance consistent with handmade plush toys. The striped pattern along the donkey’s back features vibrant horizontal bands of color (orange, purple, teal, pink) that follow a regular, aligned pattern. The transitions between colors are smooth, with no visible gaps or distortions, indicating careful construction. The texture of the stripes appears consistent with crocheted or knitted fabric, and the edges of each stripe are clean and well-defined. There are no signs of pixelation, stretching, or digital artifacts that would suggest poor rendering. Therefore, based on visual cues and expectations for handcrafted items, the mane and striped pattern exhibit a natural yarn-like texture and proper alignment.",

      "question": "Are the limbs and body proportions of both the cactus and donkey preserved in a way that reflects typical plush toy design without unnatural stretching or shrinking?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cactus plush toy has two arms extended outward, which are proportionally sized relative to its body, consistent with stylized character design often seen in amigurumi. Its pot is appropriately scaled, and the overall form maintains a balanced silhouette. The donkey, while slightly more detailed, has four legs of equal length, a rounded body, and a head-to-body ratio typical of plush animal toys. The limbs are not elongated or compressed, and there is no indication of distortion in scale or shape. Both figures appear to be designed with intentional proportions that reflect common standards in soft toy manufacturing. Comparing this to general knowledge of plush toy aesthetics—where exaggerated but harmonious proportions are acceptable—the figures here do not show any signs of unnatural stretching or shrinking. Hence, their proportions are realistic within the context of toy design.",

      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned in a way that suggests it is part of the same scene, with consistent lighting and shadow direction relative to the plush toys?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging box in Image B contains both the cactus and the donkey, and it is placed directly behind them, framing them as if they were inside. The lighting appears uniform across the entire scene, with soft shadows cast beneath the box and toys, suggesting a single light source from above. The shadows fall consistently in the same direction (slightly toward the bottom right), indicating coherence in lighting setup. Additionally, the colors and textures of the box blend naturally with the toys, and there are no abrupt changes in brightness or contrast at the edges where the toys meet the box. This continuity in lighting and shadow direction supports the idea that the box is integrated into the scene rather than being superimposed later. From a photographic standpoint, this arrangement appears intentional and professionally staged, reinforcing the impression that the box is part of the original composition.",

      "question": "Are there any visible artifacts such as jagged edges, color bleeding, or double outlines at the boundaries between the cactus, pot, donkey, and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the edges of the cactus, its pot, the donkey, and the packaging box are smooth and well-defined. There are no jagged lines or pixelation that would indicate low resolution or poor image editing. The transitions between colors—such as where the green cactus meets the brown soil or where the striped pattern ends on the donkey—are clean and sharp. There is no noticeable color bleeding (where colors spill over into adjacent areas), nor are there double outlines or ghosting effects around the objects. The integration of the toys into the box and the background appears seamless, with consistent depth and clarity throughout. These observations suggest high-quality image rendering or photography without digital artifacts. Therefore, based on visual analysis and standards for professional product imagery, no such artifacts are present.",
