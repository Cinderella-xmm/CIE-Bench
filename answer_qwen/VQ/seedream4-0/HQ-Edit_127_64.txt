    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized seating icons are placed on the grass. They do not overlap with any real people or objects in the scene. The shadows cast by these icons appear consistent with the direction of the sun, which is high and slightly to the left, as indicated by the lighting on the Eiffel Tower and other elements. This consistency suggests that the icons were carefully positioned to integrate naturally into the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The speech bubble graphics in Image B are located above and near walking figures. They do not intersect with limbs or clothing, maintaining a clear separation from the human figures. The size of the speech bubbles appears proportional relative to the scale of the people, ensuring they look natural and unobtrusive within the context of the image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The vertical split line in Image B aligns with the center of the pathway and extends consistently from the foreground to the background. It does not cut through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges, maintaining a clean division between the two halves of the image. This alignment ensures that the split line serves its purpose without disrupting important visual elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
