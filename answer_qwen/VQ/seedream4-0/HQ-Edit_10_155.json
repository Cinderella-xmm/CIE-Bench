      "question": "Is the glass dome enclosing the lantern transparent and smooth, with no visible distortions, cracks, or unnatural refraction patterns that disrupt the perception of depth or clarity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to be transparent and smooth, allowing a clear view of the lantern inside. There are no visible cracks or scratches on its surface. However, upon closer inspection, subtle refraction effects are present—particularly around the edges of the dome where light bends slightly due to curvature. These refractions are consistent with how real glass behaves under lighting conditions and do not appear artificial or distorted. The reflections on the dome's surface also mirror the surrounding environment accurately, suggesting realistic rendering. While minor optical distortions occur naturally due to curvature, they do not impair clarity or depth perception. Thus, the dome maintains transparency and visual coherence without introducing unnatural artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the scaled-down ceramic street pavements composed of clearly defined, uniformly sized tiles with accurate color transitions and no blurred or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pavement beneath the dome is designed as a miniature version of a tiled courtyard, featuring geometric patterns similar to those seen in traditional Moroccan or Islamic tilework. Each tile appears to have sharp, well-defined edges with consistent sizing across the surface. The color transitions between red, blue, green, and white tiles are clean and follow expected symmetry. There is no noticeable blurring or misalignment in the tiling pattern, which suggests careful digital modeling or physical craftsmanship. The scale matches the rest of the scene, reinforcing the illusion of a microcosm. Given the level of detail and uniformity observed, the pavement exhibits high fidelity in both design and execution.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the textile merchants and their fabric canopies proportionally small compared to the lantern, with realistic shapes and textures that do not appear stretched, duplicated, or unnaturally fused with other elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures representing textile merchants are significantly smaller than the lantern, maintaining proper scale relative to the central object. Their proportions align with typical human-like dimensions when viewed from this perspective. The fabric canopies above them are rendered with distinct folds and colors, showing attention to texture and material properties. No obvious signs of stretching or duplication are evident—the figures are spaced apart logically, and each canopy has unique positioning and shading. The integration of these elements into the base platform does not show fusion or blending issues; instead, they sit cleanly on the surface with appropriate shadows and spatial relationships. This suggests intentional design rather than procedural generation errors.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the palm trees have properly shaped fronds, rooted bases, and consistent shadows that align with the light source from the lantern, without appearing flat or detached from the ground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two palm trees flanking the lantern display fronds with natural branching patterns and layered structure, consistent with real-world botanical forms. Their trunks taper appropriately and are anchored firmly into the base, indicating rooted placement. Shadows cast by the trees fall toward the right side of the scene, consistent with the warm glow emanating from the lantern’s right-facing illumination. This directional consistency supports a coherent light source. The trees do not appear flat or silhouetted—they have depth and volume, with slight variations in leaf orientation. There is no evidence of floating or detachment; they integrate seamlessly into the scene. Therefore, the palm trees are realistically modeled and physically plausible within the context of the diorama.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the base of the dome feature a textured, weathered surface with subtle variations in tone and depth, free from uniform patterns or digital artifacts that suggest over-processing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base supporting the glass dome is made of what appears to be aged stone or wood, exhibiting a rough, uneven texture with chipped areas, discoloration, and natural wear. These characteristics contribute to a sense of antiquity and realism. The tonal variations include earthy browns, grays, and patches of rust or oxidation, all distributed organically. There are no repeating patterns or grid-like structures that would indicate digital over-processing. The surface shows depth through shadowing and highlights, enhancing its three-dimensional appearance. Overall, the weathering is convincingly applied, resembling actual erosion or aging materials rather than synthetic texturing.",
