      "question": "Are the buildings and water surface inside the sphere free from unnatural bending or warping at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The visual cues in Image B show that the buildings and water surface within the transparent sphere exhibit significant bending and warping. This is a common effect when objects are viewed through a convex lens or spherical object, as it distorts the light paths. The edges of the buildings and the water surface appear curved rather than straight, which is not natural for these structures outside the sphere. This distortion is expected due to the optical properties of the sphere.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wooden beams and stucco surfaces of the houses retain clear, natural textures without pixelation or repeating patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden beams and stucco surfaces visible through the sphere appear distorted but still retain their texture clarity. However, the distortion caused by the sphere makes it challenging to assess if there's pixelation or repeating patterns. Without direct comparison to Image A, one can infer that the textures seem consistent with what would be expected from such materials, though the distortion affects perception. Comparing with Image A, where the textures are clear and natural, Image B maintains this quality despite the distortion.",

      "question": "Does the water surface show smooth, continuous reflections of the buildings and sky without excessive glare or broken mirror-like effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the water surface inside the sphere shows reflections that are warped due to the curvature of the sphere. These reflections are not smooth or continuous as they would be in a flat, undistorted view. The glare and broken mirror-like effects are a result of the sphere's distortion, which scatters and bends light in unpredictable ways. In Image A, the water surface has smooth and continuous reflections, indicating that the distortion in Image B significantly alters this aspect.",

      "question": "Are the added mini bridges connected to both banks and do the plants grow from valid surfaces without appearing suspended in air?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mini bridges and plants appear to be part of a miniature scene placed within the sphere. The bridges seem to connect to the banks, and the plants appear to grow from surfaces that look like ground or platforms. However, due to the scale and context provided by the sphere, these elements might seem slightly artificial but are positioned logically. Comparing with Image A, where no such elements exist, the additions in Image B are coherent within their miniature context.",

      "question": "Do all visible characters have five fingers per hand, natural limb proportions, and clothing that conforms to body shape without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the characters are small figures placed within the sphere. Due to their size and the perspective, it is difficult to discern fine details such as the number of fingers. However, their limbs appear proportionate, and their clothing seems to fit naturally. There is no evident clipping or floating, suggesting that the figures are well-integrated into the scene. Comparing with Image A, where no characters are present, the figures in Image B are designed to fit the miniature aesthetic.",
