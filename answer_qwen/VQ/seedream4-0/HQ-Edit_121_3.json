      "question": "Do the transformed wings retain smooth, continuous petal shapes that follow natural curvature and avoid jagged or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly's wings have been artistically reimagined with layered, petal-like structures that resemble folded fabric or organic leaves. These wing sections are composed of smooth, flowing forms with rounded edges and gentle curves, avoiding any sharp or broken lines. The visual design mimics natural floral morphology, where petals typically grow in continuous, curved patterns without abrupt breaks. There are no visible jagged or fragmented edges; instead, the transitions between layers appear soft and seamless. This suggests an intentional artistic choice to maintain organic fluidity, consistent with natural plant growth patterns. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of botanical form, the wing shapes do follow natural curvature.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaf designs on the wings detailed, evenly distributed, and free from unnatural pixelation or repeating patterns that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leaf motifs on the wings in Image B are intricately drawn with fine veins and realistic shading, indicating a high level of detail. They are arranged in a balanced, symmetrical fashion across both wings, suggesting careful composition rather than random placement. The distribution appears even, with no clustering or gaps that would imply irregularity. Upon close inspection, there is no evidence of pixelation, blockiness, or repetitive tiling—common signs of digital artifacts. Instead, the texture of the leaves shows variation in tone and edge definition, consistent with hand-drawn or high-resolution digital art techniques. The overall impression is one of naturalistic craftsmanship, not algorithmic repetition. Thus, the leaf designs are detailed, well-distributed, and free from digital flaws.",

      "question": "Do the tendrils extending from the antennae curve smoothly and taper gradually, resembling natural plant growth rather than sharp, mechanical lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tendrils emerging from the butterfly’s antennae in Image B exhibit elegant, spiral-shaped curves that mimic the growth patterns of climbing vines or plant tendrils. These structures begin thick near the head and gradually thin toward their tips, following a natural tapering progression typical of organic plant forms. The curvature is fluid and continuous, with no sudden angles or rigid segments that would suggest artificial or mechanical construction. Their swirling motion also echoes natural helical growth seen in certain plants like ivy or morning glories. This organic flow aligns with biological principles of plant development, reinforcing the impression of living, growing elements rather than synthetic constructs. Hence, the tendrils display characteristics consistent with natural plant growth.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the small blossoms at the wing edges and foot similar in color, texture, and size to the surrounding flowers in the meadow, and do they attach seamlessly without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small blossoms located along the edges of the wings and near the butterfly’s feet in Image B are visually consistent with the larger coneflowers (Echinacea) in the meadow. They share a similar pinkish-purple hue and delicate petal structure, matching the surrounding flora in both color and texture. Their size is proportionally appropriate—smaller than the main flowers but not disproportionately tiny, which maintains visual harmony. Furthermore, these blossoms appear anchored to the wing surfaces and body through subtle stems or growth points, integrating them into the overall composition without floating effects. There are no visible clipping errors, such as parts of the flowers appearing cut off or overlapping incorrectly. The integration is smooth and contextually coherent, suggesting careful attention to spatial continuity and realism within the fantasy setting.",

      "question": "Is the butterfly’s body transformed into a straight, slender stalk that connects naturally to the head and base, with no visible breaks or misaligned segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the butterfly’s body has been reimagined as a vertical, elongated stalk resembling a plant stem. It extends downward from the head and connects smoothly to the lower part of the insect’s anatomy, maintaining a consistent diameter and structural integrity throughout its length. The transition from the head to the stalk is seamless, with no abrupt changes in thickness or alignment. The surface texture includes subtle ridges and natural variations, enhancing the illusion of a living plant structure. There are no visible breaks, joints, or misalignments that would suggest disconnection or digital stitching. The overall form is unified and anatomically plausible within the fantastical context, demonstrating a cohesive transformation that respects both artistic vision and perceived biological continuity.",
