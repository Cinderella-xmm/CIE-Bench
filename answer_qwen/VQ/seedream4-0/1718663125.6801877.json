      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) proportionally accurate and anatomically consistent with the original child's face, without any unnatural stretching or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the child’s facial features appear well-proportioned and anatomically consistent. The eyes are symmetrically placed, with natural spacing and size relative to the rest of the face. The nose is centered, with a gentle bridge and rounded tip that aligns with typical human proportions for a young child. The mouth is appropriately sized and positioned below the nose, with subtle lip definition that matches the age and facial structure. There is no visible distortion, such as elongation, compression, or asymmetry, which would suggest warping. The lighting enhances depth without altering perceived anatomy. Based on visual analysis and common knowledge of human facial anatomy, especially in children, these features are rendered naturally. Comparing to Image A, where the face has been artistically altered with skull-like makeup, the facial structure in Image B appears more realistic and unaltered, suggesting careful attention to anatomical accuracy. Thus, the facial features in Image B are proportionally accurate.",

      "question": "Does the gown exhibit natural fabric folds and shadows that follow the body’s contours, with no abrupt edges or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gown in Image B is richly detailed and appears to be made of velvet and brocade materials, common in historical attire. The folds in the fabric around the shoulders, sleeves, and bodice follow natural draping patterns consistent with gravity and body shape. Shadows are softly gradated, particularly under the ruff collar and along the seams, indicating directional lighting that interacts realistically with the material’s thickness and texture. There are no sharp, unnatural edges or pixelated transitions in the fabric, which suggests high-quality rendering. The embroidery and gold detailing are integrated smoothly into the fabric, enhancing realism. From world knowledge, historical garments like this often feature structured bodices with padded shoulders and layered fabrics—elements seen here. No visual artifacts or inconsistencies in texture are evident, supporting the conclusion that the gown’s depiction is physically plausible and well-rendered.",

      "question": "Is the hair rendered with a smooth, reflective surface that maintains natural volume and strand separation, without excessive gloss or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair in Image B is styled in a period-appropriate manner, with soft curls and a parted center. It exhibits a natural sheen, reflecting light subtly along the strands, which is consistent with healthy, dark hair under warm lighting. The volume appears realistic, with individual strands separated enough to suggest texture without being overly defined or synthetic. There is no unnatural shine or plastic-like reflection that might indicate over-saturation or digital enhancement. The way the hair falls around the face and neck follows gravitational and physical behavior expected of real hair. In contrast to Image A, where the hair is straight and less stylized, the hair in Image B shows more intentional styling and texture, but remains within natural limits. This suggests skilled rendering that balances detail with realism. Therefore, the hair is rendered with appropriate reflectivity and volume.",

      "question": "Does the velvet curtain backdrop have uniform texture and lighting that harmonizes with the subject’s illumination, without visible seams or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backdrop in Image B consists of two curtains: one deep burgundy velvet and the other golden-yellow, both appearing to be of high-quality fabric. The texture of the velvet is consistent, with a slight nap and subtle variations in shading that suggest depth and softness. Lighting appears to come from the front-left, casting gentle highlights and shadows across the fabric, which aligns with the illumination on the child’s face. There are no visible seams, tears, or abrupt color shifts between sections of the curtain. The transition between the two colors is smooth and intentional, likely designed to create a regal atmosphere. The texture of the gold curtain also shows fine details resembling brocade or damask patterns, adding to its authenticity. From world knowledge, such backdrops in classical portraits often use layered drapery to enhance depth and richness, which is achieved here without technical flaws. Thus, the backdrop is visually coherent and harmonious.",

      "question": "Are the burgundy and gold colors applied uniformly and smoothly across the gown and backdrop, without harsh edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors in Image B—the deep burgundy and rich gold—are applied with precision and consistency. On the gown, the burgundy velvet maintains a uniform tone with subtle gradations due to lighting, while the gold embroidery is cleanly outlined and does not bleed into adjacent areas. Similarly, the gold curtain behind the subject shows consistent coloration with natural variation due to fabric weave and light interaction. There are no hard edges or jagged lines where colors meet, nor any signs of color spillage or pixelation. The blending between the different materials (velvet, lace, brocade) is seamless, suggesting careful digital composition or photography. Compared to Image A, which is monochrome and lacks color complexity, Image B demonstrates advanced color control. The absence of artifacts confirms that the color application is professional and free of technical errors. Hence, the color rendering is smooth and uniform.",
