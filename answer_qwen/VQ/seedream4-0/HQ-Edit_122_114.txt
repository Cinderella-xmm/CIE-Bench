    "Question": "Q1: Are the cogs and gears forming the nest properly aligned and interlocked, showing no visible gaps or floating elements that break geometric continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the nest is composed of numerous mechanical cogs and gears integrated into a structure resembling a bird’s nest. Upon visual inspection, the gears appear to be arranged in a circular pattern around the central stork figure, with some overlapping and interlocking. However, many of the gears do not seem to mesh perfectly—there are visible gaps between adjacent gears, especially where they connect to the outer rim of the nest. Some gears appear to float without clear mechanical linkage to others, suggesting a lack of functional continuity. In real-world engineering, proper gear alignment requires precise tooth engagement and structural support; here, the artistic design prioritizes aesthetic over mechanical accuracy. Therefore, while visually striking, the arrangement lacks true geometric continuity and functional interlocking.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the copper pipes run along the roof edges in a physically plausible manner, with consistent thickness and no abrupt bends or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "The copper pipes in Image B follow the edges of the roofline, extending from the eaves down the sides and connecting to various mechanical components. The pipes maintain a relatively consistent diameter throughout their length, which aligns with typical plumbing standards. However, several sections exhibit sharp, non-gradual bends that would be difficult to achieve in real metalwork without kinking or weakening. Additionally, some pipe segments appear to float mid-air without visible support brackets or connections to the house structure, particularly near the top corners of the roof. In real construction, such unsupported piping would not be feasible due to gravity and material stress. While the design is stylized, the absence of supports and presence of unrealistic bends compromise physical plausibility.",

    "Question": "Q3: Are the metallic plates covering the stork’s body arranged in a way that follows the underlying anatomy, without unnatural overlaps or gaps between plates?",
    "explanation": "The stork in Image B is depicted as a mechanical construct with segmented metallic plates covering its body. These plates mimic feathers in shape and layering but are made of metal. The plates on the back and wings follow the general curvature of a bird's anatomy, with overlapping layers that suggest a logical progression from base to tip. However, there are noticeable gaps between some plate segments, particularly along the side of the torso and near the wing joints, where the transition between plates appears disjointed. Additionally, certain plates overlap in ways that would restrict movement, such as the rigid placement near the neck and shoulder. While the design is imaginative, the anatomical fidelity is compromised by these gaps and overly rigid arrangements, which deviate from natural avian form and function.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the mechanical joints at the stork’s neck, wing, and leg connections properly shaped and positioned to match the movement range of a real bird, without appearing distorted or misplaced?",
    "explanation": "The mechanical joints on the stork in Image B are designed with ball-and-socket-like mechanisms at the neck, shoulders, and legs. The neck joint allows for rotational movement, which is plausible given the spherical pivot point. The wing joint at the shoulder appears to allow for upward and downward motion, though it is somewhat bulky and may limit lateral movement. The leg joints include hinge-like structures that resemble knee and ankle articulation, but they are positioned higher than typical avian anatomy, potentially restricting natural stride mechanics. Moreover, the joints are oversized relative to the limbs, giving them an artificial, exaggerated appearance. While the design captures the essence of mechanical articulation, the proportions and placements do not fully align with the biomechanics of a real stork, resulting in a slightly distorted and less realistic movement range.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the integration of mechanical elements (cogs, pipes) with the wooden house maintain proportional harmony and avoid elements that appear disproportionately large or suspended without support?",
    "explanation": "The mechanical elements—such as the copper pipes and large brass gears—are integrated into the wooden house in Image B. While the overall composition is visually cohesive, some elements appear disproportionately large compared to the scale of the house. For example, the gears surrounding the nest are nearly as tall as the window and extend beyond the frame of the house, making them seem oversized. Additionally, several pipes and gears appear to float without visible structural support, especially those near the roof peak and along the gables. In reality, such heavy components would require bracing or anchoring to prevent collapse. The design leans heavily into steampunk aesthetics, sacrificing realism for dramatic effect. Thus, while artistically compelling, the integration lacks proportional harmony and structural plausibility.",
    "answer": "No"
