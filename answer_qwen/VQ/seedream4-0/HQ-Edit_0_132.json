      "question": "Do the three figures retain anatomically correct body proportions and natural hand shapes (with no more than five fingers per hand) after being stylized as ink-painting poets?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figures are rendered in a traditional Chinese ink painting style, which often emphasizes expressive gesture over strict anatomical precision. However, upon close inspection, all three figures maintain recognizable human proportions. The central figure in the foreground has clearly defined limbs and joints, with hands showing five distinct fingers, albeit simplified. The other two figures in the background are smaller but still proportionate and consistent with typical human form. While the style is stylized, it does not distort anatomy to the point of unnaturalness—fingers are not elongated or missing, and limbs follow plausible joint alignment. In traditional Chinese ink paintings, artists often use symbolic simplification while preserving fundamental anatomical correctness. Therefore, despite the artistic abstraction, the figures retain anatomical plausibility.",

      "question": "Are the willow branches and lotus leaves rendered with smooth, flowing brushstrokes that preserve their natural form and do not exhibit jagged edges or texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The willow branches in Image B are depicted using long, vertical strokes characteristic of ink wash techniques, with variations in tone suggesting depth and movement. These strokes appear fluid and continuous, without sharp digital artifacts or pixelation. The drooping nature of the willows is preserved through soft transitions between dark and light ink, mimicking natural growth patterns. Similarly, the lotus leaves are rendered with broad, sweeping strokes that capture their rounded shape and texture. There are no visible jagged edges or artificial textures; instead, the forms are defined by gradations of ink density and subtle blending. This aligns with traditional sumi-e practices where brush control creates organic, flowing lines. The absence of digital rendering flaws suggests high fidelity to the medium.",

      "question": "Does the mountain background feature soft, layered ink-wash gradients that blend naturally with the surrounding mist and sky without sharp transitions or artificial blur effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mountain in the background of Image B is rendered using translucent layers of ink wash, creating a sense of atmospheric perspective. The gradient from darker tones at the base to lighter, almost ghostly forms at the top reflects classical Chinese landscape painting techniques, such as those seen in works by artists like Huang Gongwang. The transition into the misty sky is gradual, with no abrupt changes in color or opacity. The effect is achieved through deliberate layering of ink rather than digital blurring, resulting in a harmonious fusion of mountain and atmosphere. This technique enhances depth perception and maintains visual continuity, avoiding any artificial appearance of smudging or over-smoothing. Such rendering is consistent with traditional methods designed to evoke tranquility and spatial infinity.",

      "question": "Do the arm and hand positions of the figures show natural joint alignment and fluid motion, with no bent or missing fingers or unnatural limb extensions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arm and hand positions of the figures in Image B reflect intentional postures common in tai chi or meditative gestures, which are often featured in classical Chinese art. The main figure’s raised arm shows a relaxed yet deliberate curve, with the elbow and wrist aligned in a way that suggests controlled movement. The hand is open, with five fingers visible and properly spaced, though slightly abstracted due to the ink style. There is no indication of bent or missing fingers, nor any exaggerated extension beyond anatomical limits. The second figure in the middle ground holds a similar pose, maintaining proportional joint placement. The third figure appears smaller but still adheres to natural limb articulation. Although stylization exists, it does not compromise biomechanical plausibility. Traditional ink paintings often depict dynamic poses while respecting basic human anatomy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ink-style elements (figures, willows, lotuses, mountains) harmoniously integrated into the scene with consistent lighting, shadow, and depth cues, and do they avoid appearing detached or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates strong compositional harmony typical of classical Chinese ink landscapes. All elements—the figures, willows, lotuses, and mountains—are unified under a consistent aesthetic language of ink tonality and brushwork. Lighting is implied rather than explicitly rendered, relying on contrast between dark and light areas to suggest ambient illumination from above, likely simulating morning or late afternoon light filtering through mist. Shadows are subtle and integrated into the washes, enhancing depth without disrupting the flatness characteristic of the style. Depth is conveyed through scale (foreground vs. background figures), layering, and fading ink intensity. No element appears floating or disconnected; each component contributes to a cohesive whole. The integration of calligraphy on the robe further anchors the scene culturally and stylistically. Thus, despite the minimalist approach, the scene feels grounded and balanced.",
