      "question": "Are the facial features of the fox mask (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned symmetrically and proportionally, without any stretched or deformed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes, nose, and mouth of the fox mask appear to be well-aligned and symmetrical. The eyes are evenly spaced and level with each other, the nose is centered between them, and the mouth is positioned correctly below the nose. There are no visible signs of stretching or deformation in these features. The proportions seem consistent with typical artistic representations of fox masks, suggesting careful design and rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the kimono replaced with clean, geometric motifs that follow consistent lines and shapes, without blurred or fragmented edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the kimono have indeed been replaced with geometric motifs. These new designs consist of clean lines and shapes that form a consistent pattern across the fabric. The edges of these geometric shapes are sharp and well-defined, indicating a high-quality edit without blurring or fragmentation.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the colors on the kimono and mask transition smoothly between deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones without visible color bleeding or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the colors on both the kimono and the mask exhibit smooth transitions. The deep reds, pale pinks, and metallic tones blend seamlessly into one another, maintaining a cohesive appearance. There is no evidence of color bleeding or inconsistent shading, which suggests that the editing process was executed with attention to detail and color harmony.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kimono retain a natural drape and fold structure, with no unnatural flattening or stretching of fabric that would disrupt physical plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kimono maintains a natural drape and fold structure. The fabric appears to flow realistically, with folds and creases that suggest the presence of a soft material. There are no signs of unnatural flattening or stretching, which supports the physical plausibility of the garment's depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the surfaces of the fox mask and kimono free from jagged edges, pixelation, or texture seams that suggest incomplete rendering or editing errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfaces of both the fox mask and the kimono are smooth and free from jagged edges or pixelation. The textures appear uniform, with no visible seams or interruptions that would indicate incomplete rendering or editing mistakes. This contributes to an overall polished and refined appearance.",
