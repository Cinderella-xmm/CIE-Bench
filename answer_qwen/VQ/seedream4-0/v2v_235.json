      "question": "Does the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer maintain natural proportions without introducing any unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D chibi rendition of the dancer exhibits exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art style, such as a larger head and smaller body. This is a deliberate stylistic choice rather than an unintentional distortion. The limbs are elongated but maintain a consistent scale relative to each other, which aligns with common practices in chibi illustrations. There are no abrupt geometric distortions that would disrupt the visual harmony.",

      "question": "Is the glowing elliptical portal visually credible, with no obvious artifacts where it meets the realistic dance studio environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing elliptical portal in Image B appears visually credible due to its smooth edges and seamless integration with the surrounding environment. The lighting effects around the portal enhance its three-dimensional appearance without introducing noticeable artifacts. The transition between the portal's glow and the realistic dance studio background is handled well, maintaining visual coherence.",

      "question": "Does the dancer's hand extending towards the viewer retain natural textures and details, with no more than five fingers visible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand extending towards the viewer in Image B retains natural textures and details appropriate for a 3D chibi style. It shows five fingers clearly, adhering to human anatomy. The stylization does not compromise the basic structural integrity of the hand, ensuring it remains recognizable and plausible within the context of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world consistent with the dancer's pose, contributing to a natural and visually plausible scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features spotlight effects in the grayscale 3D chibi world that align well with the dancer's pose. The light sources seem to be positioned to highlight the dancer effectively, creating shadows and highlights that contribute to the scene's depth and realism. These effects enhance the visual plausibility by emphasizing the dancer's form and movement.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the composition adhere to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal positioned in a balanced manner that enhances visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B appears to adhere closely to the 2:3 aspect ratio, with the dancer and portal centrally positioned to create a balanced visual effect. The elements are arranged in a way that draws the viewer's attention naturally, enhancing the overall credibility of the scene. The positioning supports the narrative and aesthetic appeal of the image.",
