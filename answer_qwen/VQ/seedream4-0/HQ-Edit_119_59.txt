    "Question": "Q1: Do the exaggerated arms maintain anatomical plausibility with visible muscle groups that follow natural contours and joint alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s arms are highly stylized and muscular, consistent with cartoon or animated aesthetics. While the biceps, triceps, and deltoids are clearly defined, their proportions are significantly exaggerated beyond realistic human anatomy—particularly in terms of size and separation between muscle groups. However, the overall shape of the muscles still follows a recognizable anatomical structure, with contours that align with typical joint movements (e.g., elbow flexion, shoulder articulation). The forearm and upper arm segments appear to maintain logical alignment with the skeleton, even if the volume is amplified for visual impact. In animation and comic art, such exaggeration is common and accepted as stylistic rather than literal. Therefore, while not anatomically accurate, they maintain a plausible representation within the context of stylized design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the gym-themed motifs on the tank top and shorts clearly rendered with consistent material properties and no overlapping or fragmented textures?",
    "explanation": "The tank top in Image B features gym-related icons such as dumbbells, kettlebells, and barbells printed on it. These motifs are rendered in a clean, vector-style format with clear outlines and solid colors, suggesting a digital illustration style. There is no visible texture overlap or fragmentation; each icon appears distinct and well-integrated into the fabric pattern. The material of the tank top seems to be a smooth, matte surface, consistent with athletic wear, and the print does not distort or bleed across seams. Similarly, the shorts have a simple design with no visible patterns or logos that would require detailed texture analysis. The consistency in line work and color application supports the conclusion that the motifs are cleanly rendered without artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the colorful icons positioned symmetrically on both sides of the barbell and aligned with the bar’s axis without appearing detached or distorted?",
    "explanation": "The barbell in Image B has brightly colored weight plates with various gym-themed icons (such as dumbbells, kettlebells, and numbers) on them. On both ends of the bar, the plates are arranged in a mirrored fashion, indicating symmetry. Each plate is stacked uniformly around the bar's central axis, and the icons are centered within each plate. There is no visible distortion or misalignment—each icon appears flat and properly scaled relative to the plate. Furthermore, the perspective maintains depth and alignment with the bar’s longitudinal axis, suggesting careful attention to spatial consistency. While the colors are vibrant and stylized, they do not interfere with the perceived structural integrity of the barbell components.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the shadow illustrations in the mirror maintain consistent lighting direction and depth relative to the main subject and surrounding objects?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror reflects the man and the gym environment. The reflection includes shadows cast by the figure and equipment, which appear to originate from the same light source as in the foreground—likely overhead fluorescent lights, given the gym setting. The shadows in the mirror are slightly darker and more diffuse, consistent with how reflections behave under ambient lighting. The direction of the shadows matches the angle of the light coming from above and slightly to the side, maintaining coherence with the primary scene. There is no noticeable inconsistency in shadow length or position between the real and reflected scenes. The depth perception in the mirror is preserved through subtle gradients and transparency effects, reinforcing realism despite the cartoon style. Thus, the shadow illustrations in the mirror are logically consistent with the lighting setup.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the calendar strip aligned horizontally along the bottom edge of the panel and sized appropriately to match the scale of the figure and surroundings?",
    "explanation": "At the bottom of Image B, there is a calendar strip affixed to the wooden wall beneath the mirror. It is positioned horizontally and spans nearly the full width of the panel, just below the reflective surface. Its scale appears proportionate to the figure—it is small enough to not dominate the composition but large enough to be legible. The spacing between dates and the font size are consistent with standard calendar designs. Given the height of the man and the surrounding gym equipment, the calendar is realistically sized; it does not appear oversized or undersized compared to other elements like the barbell or weights. Additionally, its placement at the base of the mirror suggests it is mounted on a wall panel, which is a common real-world arrangement. Therefore, the calendar is both correctly aligned and scaled.",
    "answer": "Yes"
