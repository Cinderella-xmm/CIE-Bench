      "question": "Does the scarecrow’s body exhibit a consistent glossy finish across all areas where straw was replaced, without visible seams, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scarecrow's body appears to have been modified with a glossy, reflective material that replaces the original straw in certain areas. This material is most prominent on the torso and limbs, where it forms a smooth, shiny surface. However, upon close inspection, there are visible transitions between the glossy sections and the remaining straw elements—especially around the arms and legs—where the texture changes abruptly. These transitions suggest seams or patchwork, which disrupt the uniformity of the finish. Additionally, the lighting creates unnatural highlights and reflections on the glossy surfaces that do not align with how light would interact with organic materials like straw or fabric. The reflection patterns appear overly sharp and inconsistent with real-world physics, indicating digital manipulation. Therefore, the glossy finish is not consistent across the entire body, and there are noticeable texture mismatches and artificial reflections.",

      "question": "Is the hat structurally intact and proportionally consistent with the original, featuring a clearly defined opening at the top that allows for candle placement without distorting its shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hat in Image B has been transformed into a lantern-like structure with a candle inside, replacing the traditional conical shape seen in typical scarecrows. While the overall silhouette retains some resemblance to a wizard’s hat, the top is now open and flat, housing a lit candle within a glass enclosure. This modification significantly alters the hat’s original form and proportions. The structural integrity of the hat is compromised because it no longer functions as a wearable headpiece but instead serves as a light source. The opening at the top is clearly defined and functional for candle placement, but this change distorts the natural curvature and tapering of a traditional hat. From a design perspective, the transformation prioritizes functionality over authenticity, resulting in a non-traditional, albeit creative, adaptation. Thus, while the opening exists, the hat is not proportionally consistent with a standard scarecrow hat due to its altered geometry.",

      "question": "Are the LED string lights positioned along the scarecrow or packaging in a way that emits soft, localized light without causing unnatural bright spots, flickering effects, or visible wiring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LED string lights are wrapped around the scarecrow’s torso, arms, and legs, as well as along the edges of the cardboard box beneath it. The lights emit a warm, golden glow that contributes to the atmospheric mood of the scene. However, upon closer examination, several issues arise: the brightness of the lights appears uneven, with some bulbs glowing intensely while others are dimmer, suggesting inconsistency in illumination. There are also visible gaps in the string, particularly near the joints of the scarecrow, where the wires seem to disappear or reappear abruptly. Moreover, the lighting casts sharp, unrealistic halos around the bulbs, which is characteristic of digital rendering rather than real-world diffusion. In addition, the shadows cast by the lights do not match the direction of the ambient moonlight, indicating a mismatch in light source logic. These factors collectively suggest that the lighting effect is artificial and lacks the natural softness expected from real LED strings.",

      "question": "Is the crow figurine resting stably on the top edge of the box, aligned with gravitational logic, and matching the size and proportions of the birds seen in flight in the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crow figurine perched atop the box in Image B appears to be balanced on the edge of the lantern structure, facing forward. Its posture is upright, with feet gripping the rim, which suggests stability under normal gravitational conditions. However, when comparing its size to the birds in flight in the background, a discrepancy becomes apparent. The flying birds appear much smaller in scale relative to the landscape, consistent with natural avian proportions. In contrast, the crow on the box seems disproportionately large—larger than the flying birds despite being closer to the viewer. This implies either an intentional artistic exaggeration or a scaling error in the composition. Furthermore, the crow’s shadow is absent or poorly rendered, which undermines the sense of physical presence. Given these inconsistencies in scale and lack of realistic shadowing, the crow does not fully align with gravitational and proportional realism.",

      "question": "Does the packaging surrounding the scarecrow have clean edges, consistent material shading, and proper shadow alignment with the light source, indicating a solid, three-dimensional box structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging in Image B is a cardboard box placed beneath the scarecrow’s feet. It features printed Halloween-themed designs, including jack-o'-lantern faces, which contribute to the festive theme. The box has sharp, well-defined edges and appears structurally sound. The shading on the box is relatively consistent, with darker tones on the sides facing away from the light source (the moon), suggesting a coherent light direction. However, the shadow cast by the box onto the ground is faint and somewhat diffuse, lacking the crispness expected from a strong directional light source like the moon. Additionally, the box’s top surface reflects light in a way that seems inconsistent with matte cardboard—there are subtle specular highlights that suggest a glossier surface than typical cardboard. Despite these minor flaws, the overall geometry and depth cues support the perception of a solid, three-dimensional object. The alignment of shadows and lighting, while imperfect, still generally follows logical spatial relationships. Therefore, the box exhibits mostly clean edges and plausible shading, supporting its interpretation as a stable, 3D structure.",
