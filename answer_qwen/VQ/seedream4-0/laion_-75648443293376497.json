      "question": "Does the leather texture across the backpack's main body appear uniformly consistent in grain, color, and thickness without unnatural seams or patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack in Image B exhibits a rich, brown leather appearance with visible variations in tone and texture that mimic natural aging and wear. The surface shows subtle gradations in color, particularly around the edges and high-contact areas, which is typical of genuine or realistically rendered leather. The grain pattern appears consistent with real leather—slightly irregular but not artificial. There are no abrupt seams or patch-like inconsistencies across the main body; instead, the texture flows smoothly from one section to another, suggesting careful craftsmanship. While some areas are darker due to lighting or simulated wear, this does not indicate flaws but rather enhances realism. Based on visual cues and world knowledge about leather goods, such variation is expected and desirable in vintage-style items. Therefore, the texture appears natural and uniform in its intended aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the buckle surfaces altered to display a brass-like finish with subtle tarnishing and realistic light reflection, without deformed shapes or mismatched highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buckles on the backpack in Image B have a metallic sheen consistent with brass or aged brass finishes. They exhibit soft highlights and shadowing that suggest a three-dimensional form under directional lighting. There is visible patina or slight tarnishing, especially near the edges and contact points, which adds authenticity to the vintage look. The reflections are smooth and follow the curvature of the metal, indicating realistic rendering. The shape of the buckles remains intact and proportionate, with no warping or distortion. These visual details align with real-world expectations for aged brass hardware used in leather goods. Thus, the buckle surfaces appear well-rendered and plausible.",

      "question": "Are the travel patches positioned on the side pockets with proper alignment to the stitching and fabric contours, showing no warping or floating appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "On the right side pocket of the backpack in Image B, there is a decorative patch featuring a map and emblem design. This patch is aligned with the contour of the pocket and follows the natural curve of the leather. The edges of the patch appear stitched down seamlessly, matching the surrounding texture and seam lines. There is no visible warping, floating effect, or misalignment that would suggest digital manipulation or poor placement. The left side also has a patch, though partially visible, which similarly integrates into the overall design. Given the attention to detail in stitching and material continuity, the patches appear naturally affixed as they would be in a real product. This reflects an understanding of textile attachment techniques and spatial coherence.",

      "question": "Is the \"EXPLORE VINTAGE\" text clearly visible on the front flap, properly aligned with the flap’s curvature, and free from jagged edges or ghosting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'EXPLORE VINTAGE' is prominently displayed on the upper flap of the backpack in Image B. It is embossed or printed in a raised, slightly distressed font that matches the vintage theme. The letters are evenly spaced and follow the gentle curvature of the flap without distortion. There are no jagged edges or pixelation, which indicates high-resolution rendering. Additionally, there is no ghosting or double-image effect around the text, suggesting clean digital application or physical engraving. The contrast between the lighter text and darker leather enhances readability. From both visual inspection and knowledge of typography in product design, this presentation is professional and well-executed.",

      "question": "Is the compass graphic near the base of the backpack rendered with fine, consistent lines that follow a circular pattern and do not distort the surrounding leather texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose located near the lower center of the backpack in Image B is intricately designed with thin, precise lines forming a symmetrical circular pattern. The lines are uniform in thickness and maintain clarity throughout, indicating high-quality detailing. Importantly, the graphic does not disrupt or warp the underlying leather texture—it blends seamlessly into the surface, respecting the natural folds and creases of the material. This suggests either skilled hand-stamping or digital rendering that preserves material integrity. In real-world applications, such graphics are often stamped or laser-etched without altering the leather's structure, and this image reflects that standard. Therefore, the compass graphic is accurately and tastefully rendered.",
