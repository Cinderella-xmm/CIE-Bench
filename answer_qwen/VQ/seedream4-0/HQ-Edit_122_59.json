      "question": "Is the elephant's size reduced proportionally so that its limbs, head, and body maintain correct relative proportions and do not appear stretched or compressed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elephant is placed within a glass display case containing a miniature landscape. The elephant appears significantly smaller than in Image A, but its anatomical proportions—such as the length of the trunk, the curvature of the tusks, the placement of the ears, and the thickness of the legs—remain consistent with those of a real elephant. There is no visual distortion such as elongation or compression; the limbs are appropriately scaled relative to the body, and the head maintains proper alignment with the spine. This suggests that the reduction in size was done proportionally. Additionally, the intricate carvings on the elephant’s body remain detailed and evenly spaced, which would be disrupted if the scaling were non-uniform. Based on these observations and general principles of proportional scaling in art and design, the elephant has been resized accurately.",

      "question": "Do the golden inlays follow the contours and patterns of the original wood carvings without creating abrupt edges or mismatched material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden inlays visible on the elephant’s headpiece, ear, and decorative harness in Image B appear to seamlessly integrate with the underlying wooden carving. The gold follows the ornate, swirling patterns typical of traditional Indian or Southeast Asian craftsmanship, aligning precisely with the grooves and ridges of the woodwork. There are no sharp discontinuities or 'floating' gold elements that suggest poor integration. The transition between the wood grain and the metallic inlay is smooth, with the gold appearing embedded rather than painted or superficially applied. This indicates careful attention to detail in matching material textures and contour flow. In contrast, if the inlays were poorly applied, one might expect visible seams, misalignment, or unnatural highlights. The lighting reflects off both materials cohesively, reinforcing the impression of a unified design. Therefore, the golden inlays respect the original carving’s structure.",

      "question": "Are the bonsai trees positioned at a scale consistent with the miniaturized elephant and do they exhibit natural leaf shapes, branch structures, and ground-level placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bonsai trees in Image B are situated around the base of the elephant within the glass enclosure. Their height and branching structure are proportionally appropriate for a miniature environment, appearing roughly one-third to one-half the height of the elephant, which is consistent with a scaled-down scene. The tree trunks show realistic tapering and gnarled textures, while the foliage displays layered, compact clusters resembling true bonsai cultivation. The branches extend naturally outward and upward, following organic growth patterns. They are planted directly into the soil-like substrate at ground level, enhancing realism. Given that bonsai trees are typically cultivated to mimic full-sized trees in miniature form, their appearance here adheres to botanical and horticultural standards. No signs of artificiality, such as unnaturally flat leaves or rigid symmetry, are evident. Thus, the trees are both scaled correctly and botanically plausible.",

      "question": "Does the miniature jungle feature natural earthy tones and textures such as soil, moss, and plant matter that are consistent with real-world botanical materials and lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature jungle within the display case exhibits a rich palette of earthy tones—browns, greens, and subtle reds—that mimic natural soil, moss, and vegetation. The soil appears granular and uneven, suggesting real dirt or sand-based substrate. Patches of green moss are visible near the base of the bonsai trees, with texture resembling damp, low-growing plants. Various small plants, including ferns and succulent-like species, add diversity to the flora. The lighting casts soft shadows and highlights that enhance depth and realism, consistent with indoor ambient illumination reflecting off organic surfaces. There are no plastic-like sheens or unnatural colors that would suggest synthetic materials. The overall composition evokes a tropical or forest floor environment, aligning with expectations for a realistic miniature ecosystem. Therefore, the textures and coloration are consistent with real-world botanical materials under naturalistic lighting.",

      "question": "Is the new stone base smooth and polished with clear, continuous floral engravings that do not exhibit jagged lines, missing segments, or inconsistent depth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stone base in Image B is a substantial, rounded slab supporting the glass enclosure. Its surface is visibly smooth and uniformly polished, reflecting light evenly without rough patches or scratches. The floral engraving along the front edge features a symmetrical design of leaves and a central flower, rendered with clean, flowing lines. The depth of the carving appears consistent throughout, with no broken segments or abrupt stops. The relief work shows gradual transitions from raised to recessed areas, indicating skilled craftsmanship. There are no jagged edges or digital artifacts that might suggest poor rendering or incomplete modeling. In comparison to typical hand-carved stone bases used in museum displays, this one matches the aesthetic and technical quality expected. Thus, the base meets the criteria for smoothness, polish, and high-quality engraving.",
