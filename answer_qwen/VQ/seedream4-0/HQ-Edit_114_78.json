      "question": "Does the key maintain its original geometric shape and proportions when transformed into a bridge, without any visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ornate key is positioned such that its bow (the decorative top) appears to transition into a bridge structure over a resin river. However, the transformation from key to bridge involves a significant morphing of the key’s form. The bow of the key is stretched horizontally to form the arch of the bridge, which alters its original proportions. This elongation creates a clear distortion in the key's geometry—specifically, the intricate swirls and curves of the bow are flattened and extended to fit the span of the bridge. Such changes are inconsistent with maintaining the original geometric shape and proportions. In real-world physics and design, a rigid object like a key cannot seamlessly transform into a bridge without structural deformation. Therefore, the visual representation shows warping and stretching, especially noticeable in the curvature and spacing of the decorative elements.",

      "question": "Are the tiny houses and trees positioned in a way that aligns with the wood grain’s depth and surface plane, without floating or appearing disconnected from the background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiny houses and trees are arranged on a carved wooden hill within an open vintage suitcase. The hill itself has a textured surface resembling natural wood, with visible grain patterns that match the surrounding materials. The miniature structures are placed on this elevated surface, with moss and vines adding to the illusion of integration. The lighting casts soft shadows beneath the houses and trees, suggesting they rest on a tangible surface. There is no indication of floating; instead, the objects appear anchored by their placement on the hill and supported by the terrain. Furthermore, the depth cues—such as perspective and shadowing—align with the surface plane of the hill, reinforcing the sense of physical grounding. While some artistic liberties are taken, the overall composition respects spatial coherence and avoids disconnection from the background.",

      "question": "Does the resin river emerge smoothly from the key’s bit and flow with consistent material properties, showing no sharp breaks or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The resin river originates from the key’s bit (the toothed end), flowing outward in a translucent, blue-tinted stream. The transition from the solid metal of the key to the liquid-like resin is smooth, with the resin forming a continuous curve that mimics natural water flow. The color gradient is consistent—starting with a deeper blue near the source and gradually lightening as it spreads. There are no abrupt edges or color discontinuities, and the surface reflects light in a manner typical of glossy resin. Additionally, the flow follows a logical path down the side of the suitcase, enhancing the illusion of fluid dynamics. While the realism may be enhanced by artistic manipulation, the material properties of the resin remain coherent throughout, without visible breaks or inconsistencies.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the boundary of the key case clearly defined and consistent with the wood grain and metallic tones of the key, without abrupt changes in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The key case, which appears to be an old-fashioned suitcase, has a distinct border formed by aged metal clasps and rivets. The exterior of the case exhibits a weathered, dark green patina with visible scratches and wear, contrasting subtly with the warm brown tones of the wooden interior. The transition between the case and the wooden surface beneath it is well-defined, with soft shadows indicating depth. However, there is a slight mismatch in texture where the case meets the surrounding environment—the wood grain of the table does not perfectly align with the grain of the suitcase’s interior, suggesting a digital composite. Moreover, the lighting on the case varies slightly compared to the key and the hill, with the case appearing dimmer and less reflective. These inconsistencies suggest that while the boundary is mostly clear, there are subtle disruptions in texture and illumination that detract from seamless integration.",

      "question": "Is the carved wooden hill seamlessly blended into the surrounding wood grain, with consistent texture and shading that suggests natural carving rather than digital patching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden hill is intricately carved to resemble a natural outcrop, complete with bark-like textures and deep grooves that mimic tree roots and erosion. The grain pattern of the hill continues naturally from the surrounding surfaces, particularly the inner lining of the suitcase, which shares similar tonal variations and directional lines. Shading is carefully applied to create depth, with highlights and shadows following the contours of the hill. The moss and vines growing from it further enhance the illusion of organic growth. There are no visible seams or repetitive patterns that would indicate digital patching. Instead, the texture and lighting suggest hand-carved craftsmanship, consistent with real-world sculpting techniques. The integration of the hill into the scene feels organic and cohesive, supporting the interpretation that it was designed to appear as a natural element within the diorama.",
