      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the red helmet and blue cap on the paddles maintain proportional size relative to the paddle heads and avoid stretching or warping the underlying rubber surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red helmet and blue cap are stylized cartoon accessories placed on the ping pong paddles. The helmet appears to be proportionally sized relative to the paddle head, fitting snugly without distorting the shape of the red rubber surface. Similarly, the blue cap is scaled appropriately for the blue paddle, sitting naturally on top without causing any visible warping or stretching of the rubber. Both accessories appear to be digitally added in a way that respects the original dimensions of the paddle heads, maintaining visual consistency with typical proportions seen in cartoon illustrations. There is no evidence of pixelation, distortion, or unnatural stretching, suggesting careful digital design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cartoon facial features and accessories on the paddles seamlessly integrated with no visible stitching, sharp edges, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cartoon faces on the paddles include eyes, mouths, cheeks, and other accessories like helmets and caps. These features are rendered in a smooth, vector-style animation format typical of modern digital illustrations. The integration appears seamless—there are no visible stitching lines, jagged edges, or abrupt changes in shading that would suggest poor blending. The gradients and outlines are consistent with professional-grade digital art, and the lighting across the faces matches the overall scene's illumination. This indicates high-quality rendering and attention to detail in the artwork.",

      "question": "Are the golden edges confined to the perimeter of the box lid and base, without extending into the interior or forming disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The treasure chest in Image B has a glittering golden border along its outer edges, including the lid and base. Upon close inspection, the gold trim follows the outer contour of the chest precisely and does not extend into the interior. The edges are continuous and form a clean, unbroken line around the perimeter. There are no gaps or disconnected segments, and the sparkle effect remains confined to the outer frame. This suggests intentional design to emphasize the chest’s ornate appearance while maintaining structural coherence.",

      "question": "Do the speech bubbles have pointed tails directed toward the paddles and avoid overlapping with the box or paddle handles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B contains the text 'Ready for the ultimate match quest!' and has a pointed tail that clearly directs toward the red paddle character. The tail is properly aligned with the character’s mouth area, indicating correct source attribution. Importantly, the bubble does not overlap with the treasure chest or the paddle handles; it floats above them in a natural position. The placement avoids visual clutter and maintains readability, which is standard practice in comic-style illustrations. No parts of the bubble intrude into the physical space occupied by the box or paddles.",

      "question": "Is the treasure map background composed of uniformly drawn lines with no pixelation, aliasing, or irregular stroke widths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B features a detailed treasure map with various elements such as islands, ships, compasses, and handwritten labels. The lines used to draw the map are consistent in thickness and style, resembling hand-drawn cartography. There is no visible pixelation or aliasing, suggesting the image was created using vector graphics or high-resolution raster art. Stroke widths remain uniform across the map, and the details are crisp and clear, even at smaller scales. This level of detail and smoothness indicates professional digital illustration techniques were employed.",

      "question": "Are the paddles tilted upward from the box but still supported by the handle slots, maintaining structural plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two paddles appear to be emerging from the treasure chest, tilted upward as if leaping out. While they are animated in a dynamic pose, their wooden handles are still positioned within the slot openings of the chest, implying support. The angle of tilt is exaggerated for dramatic effect, but the handles remain engaged with the chest structure, preserving a degree of physical plausibility. In real-world terms, this would require internal supports or hinges, but within the context of a cartoon illustration, the depiction is acceptable and consistent with common artistic conventions for action poses. Thus, despite the stylization, the scene maintains a believable structural relationship between the paddles and the chest.",
