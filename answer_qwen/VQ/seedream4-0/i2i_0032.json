      "question": "Do the newly added chibi-style illustrations appear naturally integrated into the image without breaking the visual flow or appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustrations in Image B are cartoonish, colorful, and stylized food items (banana, cookie, egg, cheese, rice, etc.) with expressive faces and limbs. They are overlaid on top of the original photograph of a skateboarder performing a trick, which is a real-world scene with natural lighting and realistic proportions. The contrast between the hyper-stylized, flat-colored stickers and the photographic realism of the background creates a jarring visual effect. These illustrations lack depth, shadow, and perspective alignment with the environment, making them appear as if they were pasted on top rather than part of the scene. Their placement does not follow any logical spatial relationship with the skater or the ramp, and their bright colors and outlines stand out too much against the muted tones of the background. Therefore, they disrupt the visual flow and appear out of place.",

      "question": "Are the chibi-style illustrations free from unnatural textures and maintain clear details, avoiding any loss of definition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustrations are rendered in a clean, digital vector art style with smooth lines, consistent colors, and sharp edges. Each character has defined features such as eyes, cheeks, mouths, and limbs, and there is no visible pixelation, blurring, or texture distortion. The white borders around each illustration enhance clarity and separation from the background, ensuring that the details remain intact. Even though the illustrations are layered over a complex background, their internal details remain crisp and well-defined. There is no sign of compression artifacts or degradation in quality, indicating that the illustrations themselves are high-quality and free from unnatural textures.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi-style illustrations correctly match their surroundings, avoiding any distortion or inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustrations are significantly larger than realistic proportions for food items in the context of the scene. For example, the banana and cookie are roughly the same size as the skateboarder’s head, while the cup of rice is comparable in height to the skater's torso. This exaggeration breaks physical rationality—objects of such size would not be plausible in this environment. Furthermore, these characters are floating in mid-air without any support or interaction with the physical world (e.g., no shadows, no collision with the ramp), which violates basic laws of physics and spatial logic. Their positioning also lacks alignment with the camera perspective; they do not recede or scale appropriately with distance, further distorting the sense of depth. Thus, their proportions and placement are inconsistent with the real-world setting.",

      "question": "Are the actions and expressions assigned to the chibi-style illustrations natural and plausible, free from any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustrations feature anthropomorphic expressions and gestures, such as smiling faces, raised arms, and peace signs. While these expressions are cute and playful, they are not grounded in realism—they are stylistic choices typical of kawaii or cartoon aesthetics. However, within the context of their own design language, the actions and expressions are internally consistent and not distorted. For instance, the cheese block making a 'peace' sign and the egg waving are exaggerated but not physically deformed. There is no stretching, warping, or unnatural bending of limbs or bodies. The facial features are symmetric and proportionate to the character forms. Therefore, although the actions are whimsical and not plausible in reality, they are executed cleanly and without technical distortion within the cartoon framework.",

      "question": "Does the style of the chibi-style illustrations suitably match the recipe notebook theme and harmonize with the overall image without introducing unnatural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style illustrations are clearly designed in a cute, cartoonish aesthetic commonly associated with children's books, mobile apps, or recipe-themed content where food is personified for fun appeal. This style aligns well with a recipe notebook theme, especially one targeting younger audiences or aiming for a lighthearted tone. However, the overall image (Image B) combines this whimsical style with a gritty, urban skateboarding scene featuring a shirtless young man in a dynamic pose under natural daylight. The juxtaposition of a serious, action-oriented real-world moment with cheerful, animated food characters creates a thematic mismatch. The chibi elements feel like an unrelated overlay rather than a coherent narrative or stylistic choice. Thus, while the style fits a recipe notebook concept in isolation, it does not harmonize with the actual visual context of the edited image, introducing an unnatural and incongruous element.",
