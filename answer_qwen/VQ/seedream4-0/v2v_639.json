      "question": "Are the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe free from unnatural textures and maintain their structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO minifigures of the person and giraffe are clearly constructed from standard LEGO bricks. The textures on both figures appear consistent with typical LEGO plastic surfaces—smooth, matte, and uniform in color. The person minifigure has a blue shirt and pants, a cap, and articulated limbs, all of which are rendered with clean edges and no visible warping or texture anomalies. The giraffe is built with beige and brown pieces to simulate its natural pattern, and the structure maintains anatomical proportions appropriate for a LEGO model. There are no signs of pixelation, blurring, or unnatural surface artifacts that would suggest digital manipulation or poor rendering. The modular construction is coherent, with each brick fitting logically into the overall shape. This structural integrity aligns with real-world LEGO building principles, indicating that the figures are free from unnatural textures and maintain coherence.",

      "question": "Do the geometric shapes of the LEGO minifigures appear undamaged and structurally consistent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The geometric shapes of both the LEGO minifigure and the giraffe are composed of standard LEGO elements such as rectangular bricks, round connectors, and specialized curved pieces. These components are aligned correctly, with no visible cracks, misalignments, or missing parts. The legs, torso, arms, and head of the human figure follow the typical LEGO minifigure design, and the giraffe's long neck, legs, and body are proportionally accurate for a LEGO interpretation. The joints between bricks appear intact, and there are no signs of deformation or collapse in the structure. The use of consistent angles and symmetrical placement supports structural consistency. Given that LEGO models rely on precise interlocking geometry, the absence of any visual flaws indicates that the shapes are undamaged and structurally sound.",

      "question": "Does the transparent glass cube enclosing the LEGO scene look natural and free from obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass cube in Image B appears highly reflective and transparent, with clean edges and smooth surfaces. There are no visible distortions, scratches, or fogging that would suggest poor rendering or physical imperfections. Reflections on the glass are subtle and realistic, showing faint ambient light and surroundings without overemphasizing glare or chromatic aberration. The transparency allows clear visibility of the LEGO figures inside, and the refraction effects are minimal and consistent with how real glass behaves under studio lighting. No digital artifacts such as jagged edges, moiré patterns, or unnatural highlights are present. The cube’s corners are sharp and well-defined, suggesting high-quality modeling and rendering. Therefore, the glass cube looks natural and artifact-free.",

      "question": "Does the lighting in the scene properly highlight the intricate details of the LEGO minifigures and the glass cube without causing any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is soft and directional, likely originating from the front-left side, casting gentle shadows and enhancing the three-dimensional appearance of the LEGO figures. Highlights on the plastic surfaces of the minifigures emphasize their texture and contours, while the glass cube reflects light subtly without overexposure or hotspots. The lighting does not cause blooming, halos, or color shifts that could obscure details. Shadows are soft and consistent with the light source, and there is no clipping or loss of detail in dark areas. The interior of the glass case is evenly illuminated, allowing full visibility of the LEGO construction. This balanced illumination preserves the fine details of the bricks and the clarity of the glass, indicating that the lighting is effective and distortion-free.",

      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the scene's earthy and natural tones without introducing unnatural textures or loss of details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a smooth gradient transitioning from dark at the top to lighter gray at the bottom. This gradient serves to isolate the display case and draw attention to the LEGO model without distracting elements. The colors are neutral and do not clash with the earthy tones of the LEGO giraffe (beige and brown) or the blue uniform of the minifigure. There are no visible textures, noise, or banding in the gradient, which would indicate poor rendering. The transition is seamless, and the lack of sharp edges or artifacts suggests high-quality image processing. The simplicity of the background enhances the focus on the subject without introducing visual distractions or losing detail in the foreground. Thus, the gradient complements the scene naturally and maintains visual integrity.",
