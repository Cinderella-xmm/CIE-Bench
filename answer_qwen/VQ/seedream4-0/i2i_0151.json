      "question": "Does the kite maintain its geometric shape without any distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the kite is depicted as a diamond-shaped object with four distinct triangular panels converging at a central point, which is consistent with a traditional diamond kite design. The edges are sharp and symmetrical, and there are no visible creases, tears, or deformations that would suggest distortion or damage. The structure appears intact, with clean lines and uniform angles, indicating a well-maintained geometric form. This observation aligns with common knowledge about kites made from lightweight materials like paper or fabric, which typically retain their shape when airborne in stable conditions. There is no visual evidence of warping, folding, or structural failure.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures on the kite that do not align with the expected paper material appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "The kite in Image B has a smooth, slightly reflective surface that is consistent with paper or thin synthetic material commonly used in kite construction. The texture lacks any graininess, wrinkles, or imperfections that might suggest poor quality or unrealistic rendering. However, the edges appear too perfectly defined and the surface lacks subtle variations such as slight folds or shadows that would be expected in real paper under sunlight. Despite this, the overall appearance remains plausible for a stylized or digitally rendered kite. Given that this image may be part of a crafted scene (as suggested by surrounding decorative elements), the texture is intentionally simplified but still within acceptable bounds for artistic representation. No grossly unnatural textures—such as plastic-like sheen or digital artifacts—are present.",

      "question": "Is the yellow color of the kite consistent and natural against the sky backdrop, without any unnatural color variance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow color of the kite in Image B is vibrant and uniform across its surface, matching typical hues seen in brightly colored kites. It contrasts naturally with the light blue sky, enhancing visibility while maintaining realistic chromatic harmony. There are no abrupt shifts in tone, patches of discoloration, or unnatural gradients that would suggest digital manipulation or lighting inconsistencies. The shading on the kite’s surface follows logical illumination patterns based on the sun's position in the upper right corner, casting soft highlights and shadows that contribute to depth perception. This suggests careful attention to lighting physics and color balance, resulting in a visually coherent and natural appearance.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the kite's tail appear structurally coherent and smoothly connected to the kite body, without any visible breaks or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite's tail in Image B is a long, ribbon-like extension attached to the bottom of the kite body. It flows downward in a curved manner, suggesting movement due to wind. The connection between the tail and the kite is seamless, with no gaps, fraying, or misalignment. The tail maintains a consistent width and smooth curvature throughout its length, indicating structural coherence. While it is slightly twisted in places, this is realistic given airflow dynamics. There are no visual breaks or anomalies such as floating segments or sudden thickness changes. Thus, the tail appears both physically plausible and artistically integrated into the composition.",

      "question": "Is the kite string depicted naturally, free from any artifacts or unrealistic thickness variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kite string in Image B is represented as a thin, white line extending from the kite toward the lower-left area of the frame. It appears delicate and taut, consistent with typical kite strings made of nylon or similar materials. The string shows slight undulations and curves, which simulate natural tension and wind interaction. Its thickness remains relatively constant along its visible length, with no sudden expansions or collapses that would indicate digital artifacts. Although the string is faint and blends subtly into the background, this is reasonable given the distance and atmospheric perspective. Overall, the depiction adheres to expectations for how a kite string should look in flight, especially in a stylized yet realistic setting.",
