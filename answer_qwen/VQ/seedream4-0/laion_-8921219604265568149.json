      "question": "Does the cathedral façade maintain detailed textures and depth consistent with the original stone structure, or does it appear uniformly smooth and plastic-like due to the resin material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cathedral façade appears significantly altered from its real-world counterpart. The surface texture lacks the natural irregularities, weathering, and fine stonework details typical of aged limestone architecture. Instead, the façade has a uniform, matte finish with exaggerated highlights and soft shadows that suggest a molded or cast material—likely resin or plaster—used in miniature models. The architectural elements such as columns, scrolls, and window frames are simplified and lack the intricate carvings present in actual Baroque cathedrals. This smoothness and artificial consistency indicate that the structure is not made of real stone but rather a synthetic replica. The lighting also enhances this illusion by casting even, diffused illumination across the surface, further reducing perceived depth and texture.",

      "question": "Are the added miniature figures proportionally scaled and positioned so they appear naturally smaller than the cathedral and surrounding buildings without appearing stretched, flattened, or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature figures in Image B are clearly out of scale compared to the cathedral and surrounding environment. While they are small enough to be interpreted as distant people, their proportions do not match realistic human-to-architecture ratios. They appear slightly distorted—some seem elongated vertically, and others have unnatural postures. Additionally, their placement on the plaza does not align with the perspective of the scene; for instance, some figures near the base of the display case appear disproportionately large relative to those farther away, suggesting inconsistent scaling. Furthermore, the figures’ shadows and lighting do not integrate seamlessly with the ambient light of the scene, indicating they were likely digitally inserted or placed after the fact. These factors collectively suggest a lack of proportional accuracy and natural integration.",

      "question": "Do the miniature lamps emit soft, localized light that appears consistent with their size and placement, without creating unrealistic glows or illuminating areas that should remain in shadow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature lamps in Image B are designed to resemble traditional streetlamps, and they emit a warm, golden glow. However, the light they produce is overly bright and expansive for their size. Realistic lamp lighting would cast soft, directional illumination limited to nearby surfaces, but here the glow extends unnaturally far into the scene, illuminating parts of the display case and background sky that should be in shadow. Moreover, the light appears to originate from within the glass enclosure, which is physically implausible since the lamps are mounted outside the case. This creates an inconsistent lighting effect that contradicts real-world physics and suggests digital enhancement or poor rendering. Thus, the lighting behavior is unrealistic.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the display case fully integrated around the cathedral and square with clean, continuous edges and no intersecting or fragmented parts that disrupt the geometry of the original structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display case in Image B is a prominent feature—a large, ornate wooden frame with glass panels encasing the entire cathedral model. While the case is visually coherent and symmetrically framed, it visibly intersects with the surrounding buildings and plaza. For example, the vertical edges of the case cut through the façades of adjacent buildings on both sides, and the base of the case overlaps the ground level where pedestrians walk. These intersections create visual discontinuities: the building walls appear truncated at the frame’s edge, and the pavement seems to abruptly end at the case boundary. There are no signs of blending or merging between the case and the real-world environment, which breaks the spatial continuity. Therefore, the display case is not fully integrated—it imposes itself onto the scene rather than being seamlessly embedded.",

      "question": "Is the engraved plaque clearly visible, properly aligned, and styled with appropriate depth and lettering that matches the baroque aesthetic without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The engraved plaque at the base of the display case in Image B is visible and centrally positioned. It features decorative scrollwork and Latin-style text, consistent with Baroque design principles. However, upon closer inspection, the lettering appears too uniform and sharp, lacking the subtle variations and wear expected in hand-engraved metalwork. The depth of the engraving seems shallow, and the contrast between raised and recessed areas is minimal, giving it a flat appearance. Additionally, the plaque's surface reflects light evenly, suggesting a smooth, possibly printed or digitally rendered texture rather than a physically carved one. Its alignment is correct, but the overall styling feels more like a reproduction or graphic overlay than an authentic artifact. These cues indicate that while the plaque mimics Baroque aesthetics, it fails to achieve convincing physical realism.",
