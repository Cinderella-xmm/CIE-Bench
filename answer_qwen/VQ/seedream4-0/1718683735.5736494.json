      "question": "Does the chibi-style figurine retain proportionally consistent limbs and head size relative to the body, avoiding unnatural elongation or compression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style figurine in Image B exhibits a typical chibi design where the head is disproportionately large compared to the body, while the limbs are shorter and thicker. This style intentionally avoids realistic proportions for a cute and stylized effect. The limbs and head appear consistently sized with no signs of unnatural elongation or compression that would disrupt this stylistic choice.",

      "question": "Is the tricorne hat's shape preserved with clean edges and consistent material texture, free from distortions or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tricorne hat on the figurine in Image B has well-defined edges and a uniform texture that suggests a fabric-like material.

      "question": "Are the miniature treasure chest and spilled gold coins positioned with proper perspective and shadow alignment, ensuring they appear grounded and integrated into the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The treasure chest and gold coins in Image B are placed on the deck with appropriate perspective, as they appear smaller in relation to the figurine, suggesting distance. Shadows cast by these objects align with the light source, making them seem grounded and naturally integrated into the scene.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the tiny daggers and nautical motifs on the wooden deck appear fixed in place with consistent scale and orientation, avoiding floating or misaligned elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The daggers and nautical motifs on the deck in Image B are depicted at a consistent scale relative to the deck and other elements. They are oriented in a way that suggests they are embedded or resting on the deck, with no indication of floating or misalignment, contributing to the overall coherence of the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the hands of the figurine have no more than five fingers, with naturally shaped knuckles and skin texture, and do they maintain proper grip on the treasure chest?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the chibi-style figurine in Image B have a simplified design typical of such art styles, with no more than five fingers each. The knuckles and skin texture are stylized but consistent with the overall aesthetic. The hands are shown gripping the treasure chest in a manner that is appropriate for the figurine's size and style.",
