      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D character maintain structural consistency and visual credibility, avoiding unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D character in Image B features exaggerated proportions typical of chibi art—such as a large head relative to the body, simplified facial features, and stylized limbs—which are consistent with common conventions in anime and cartoon design. The character’s structure is symmetrical and anatomically coherent within the stylistic framework of chibi aesthetics. There are no visible distortions such as misaligned limbs, inconsistent scaling, or floating parts. The character stands upright with balanced posture, and the clothing fits proportionally. While not realistic, it maintains internal consistency within its artistic style. This suggests that the character is designed with care for structural integrity within the intended aesthetic, avoiding unnatural artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the playful raindrops surrounding the chibi character visually credible and integrated naturally into the scene without introducing obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The raindrops in Image B are rendered as colorful, translucent teardrop shapes scattered around the character and falling from the sky. While real raindrops are typically clear and uniform in shape, these stylized drops are clearly artistic enhancements meant to evoke playfulness and whimsy, common in animated or illustrative styles. They appear evenly distributed and follow a downward trajectory, which aligns with gravity. However, their bright, rainbow-like colors (e.g., pink, blue, purple) are physically implausible for actual raindrops under normal lighting conditions. Despite this, they are visually integrated into the scene without clashing with other elements and do not exhibit jagged edges, pixelation, or clipping artifacts. Their presence enhances the magical or cheerful tone of the image rather than detracting from it. Given the context of a chibi-style character, such stylization is acceptable and intentional.",

      "question": "Is the oversized, brightly colored umbrella visually consistent with the chibi character and the environment, without causing any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The umbrella in Image B is significantly larger than what would be proportionally appropriate for a real child, but given the chibi character's exaggerated scale (large head, small body), the oversized umbrella is thematically consistent. It matches the character’s playful and cartoonish aesthetic. The rainbow pattern on the umbrella is vibrant and well-defined, with smooth color transitions and no visible texture flaws or pixelation. The umbrella casts a subtle shadow beneath it, indicating proper lighting integration. Its placement above the character is logical and does not intersect unnaturally with the body. The material appears taut and realistic enough for a fabric umbrella in a stylized rendering. No warping, stretching, or texture repetition is evident. Therefore, while exaggerated in size, the umbrella remains visually cohesive within the scene’s artistic style.",

      "question": "Do the wall and drainpipe maintain their realistic appearance and function, with the water flow interacting naturally with the ground, without any visible artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wall in Image B has a textured, matte finish resembling stucco, consistent with the original image’s architectural style. The drainpipe is metallic gray with a curved elbow joint, accurately reflecting real-world downspout design. Water flows smoothly from the pipe into a puddle below, forming a natural splash pattern upon impact. The ground shows wet reflections and pooling water, suggesting proper interaction between the liquid and surface. A drainage grate is now visible near the base of the pipe, which adds realism by providing a plausible outlet for runoff. The water stream is continuous and physically plausible, with droplets separating at the end. There are no visible glitches such as floating water, unnatural transparency, or clipping. The overall environmental details support functional realism despite the stylized character.",

      "question": "Do the green jacket and boots of the chibi character retain their natural textures and fine details, avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green jacket and boots of the chibi character are rendered with smooth surfaces and consistent shading, indicating high-quality 3D modeling. The jacket features visible stitching lines, pockets, and a hood that conforms naturally to the character’s head. The boots have a glossy finish, simulating rubber material, with subtle reflections and slight wear patterns that enhance realism. There are no visible texture seams, pixelation, or distortion artifacts. The folds in the jacket are soft and logical, matching the character’s posture. While slightly simplified due to the chibi style, the materials appear cohesive and well-integrated. The lighting interacts consistently across both items, reinforcing their three-dimensional form. No unnatural highlights or shadowing suggest poor rendering quality.",
