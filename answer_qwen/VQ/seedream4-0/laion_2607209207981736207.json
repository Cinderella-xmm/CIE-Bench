      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the metallic texture applied to the scanner's body exhibit consistent highlights and reflections that align with the light source direction, avoiding patchy or overly shiny areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scanner's body has a metallic texture with highlights and reflections that appear consistent. The light source seems to be coming from above, as indicated by the way the reflections are distributed along the edges and surfaces of the scanner. There are no overly shiny or patchy areas; instead, the reflections create a smooth gradient effect, which is typical for metallic finishes in product design. This analysis is based on observing how light interacts with the surface textures and shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the holographic display integrated into the front panel with translucent edges and layered visual depth, maintaining alignment with the scanner’s shape and not appearing as a simple 2D overlay?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The holographic display in Image B appears integrated into the front panel with translucent edges, giving it a layered visual depth. It aligns well with the scanner’s shape and does not look like a simple 2D overlay. The display seems to extend slightly beyond the physical boundaries of the scanner, creating an immersive effect. Comparing this with Image A, where there is no such display, reinforces that the hologram is a deliberate addition that enhances the futuristic aesthetic without disrupting the device's form.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the grid lines evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device, forming continuous patterns without jagged edges or interruptions that suggest digital artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grid lines in Image B are evenly spaced and aligned with the orientation of the device. They form continuous patterns without any visible jagged edges or interruptions. This suggests a high-quality digital rendering process that avoids common issues like aliasing or pixelation. In contrast, Image A lacks these grid lines, so their presence here is purely an enhancement that contributes to the futuristic theme.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tech-themed icons and branding clearly legible, properly scaled, and positioned in non-intrusive areas such as the lower corners or sides, without overlapping critical components like the control panel or paper path?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tech-themed icons and branding in Image B are clearly legible and properly scaled. They are positioned in non-intrusive areas, such as the lower corners and sides, ensuring they do not overlap critical components like the control panel or paper path. This placement respects the user interface design principles, maintaining clarity and functionality. Comparing with Image A, where similar elements might be present but less stylized, shows an improvement in visual hierarchy and aesthetics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the transformed packaging retain the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components (e.g., paper feed slot, control panel area) as the original scanner, preventing distortion or misalignment of key parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transformed packaging in Image B retains the same overall dimensions and spatial relationships between components as seen in Image A. Key parts like the paper feed slot and control panel area remain proportionally accurate and undistorted. The holographic and metallic enhancements do not alter the fundamental structure or layout of the scanner, preserving its original design integrity while adding futuristic elements.",
