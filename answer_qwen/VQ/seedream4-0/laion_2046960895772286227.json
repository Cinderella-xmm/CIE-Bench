      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the arms and legs of the figure have clearly defined joints and correct proportions, with no missing or extra limbs, and do the hands each have exactly five fingers arranged naturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figure appears to be a doll, evident from its stylized features and mechanical joints. The arms and legs are articulated at the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees, showing clear joint lines typical of collectible dolls. Each hand has five fingers, though they are simplified in form, consistent with doll design. The proportions of the limbs relative to the body are appropriate for a human-like doll figure. There are no extra or missing limbs. The hands are positioned naturally, with fingers slightly curved as if in mid-step. This aligns with common doll construction practices where limbs are segmented for articulation but maintain anatomical plausibility within stylistic constraints.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the pattern on the jacket and the stitching on the skirt preserved and aligned correctly, with no distorted or repeated textures, and does the fabric drape naturally over the doll's form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jacket in Image B features a subtle floral or paisley-like pattern that is consistently applied across the fabric, without visible repetition or distortion. The texture appears uniform, suggesting careful digital rendering or high-quality material application. The blue sash tied around the waist is neatly aligned, and the edges of the jacket’s trim match symmetrically. The skirt displays a zigzag stitching pattern along the hem, which is evenly spaced and properly aligned. The fabric drapes smoothly over the doll’s form, with folds that follow natural gravity and movement, especially noticeable near the knees and outer edges. These details suggest attention to textile realism and proper modeling, consistent with high-quality doll craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Is the lace trim around the collar thin and evenly applied, with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural shadows indicating poor integration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collar of the doll’s coat in Image B is adorned with a delicate white lace trim. The lace appears thin and intricately detailed, with consistent spacing and shape around the collar. There are no visible gaps or irregularities in the placement. The shadowing beneath the lace is soft and follows the curvature of the collar, suggesting it is integrated into the garment rather than floating above it. The lighting is even, and there are no harsh shadows or highlights that would indicate poor layering or digital artifacts. This level of detail indicates careful design and rendering, typical of high-end collectible dolls.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the velvet hat properly sized relative to the head, with visible fabric texture and soft shadows that suggest it is resting on the head rather than floating above it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The maroon velvet hat on the doll in Image B is proportionally sized—neither too large nor too small—for the head, fitting snugly like a traditional top hat. The surface of the hat shows fine texture indicative of velvet, including subtle sheen and depth, which enhances realism. Soft shadows are cast beneath the brim and along the sides of the hat, consistent with how light would interact with a fabric object resting on a head. These shadows are gradual and realistic, not abrupt or disconnected, reinforcing the impression that the hat is firmly placed on the head. No floating effect is observed, and the overall presentation suggests careful attention to lighting and material simulation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cobblestone ground, gas lamps, and horse-drawn carriages in the background proportionally smaller than the doll and rendered with consistent textures and lighting that match the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background elements—including the cobblestone street, gas lamp, and horse-drawn carriage—are rendered with a shallow depth of field, making them appear slightly blurred but still identifiable. However, their size relative to the doll is accurate; they are proportionally smaller, indicating correct perspective. The cobblestones show varied shapes and textures, consistent with real stone paving. The gas lamp emits a warm glow, and its shadow is softly cast, matching the ambient lighting. The carriage is detailed with wooden wheels and metal fittings, and its scale is appropriate for the setting. Lighting across all elements is cohesive, with soft diffusion and no harsh contrasts, suggesting a well-composed scene designed to complement the doll. While the background is stylized, it maintains visual consistency with the foreground figure.",

      "question": "Does the face have simplified features typical of a doll (such as painted eyes and smooth skin), and do the limbs show clear joint lines or hinges without unnatural bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The face of the figure in Image B exhibits characteristics typical of a doll: smooth, unblemished skin, symmetrical facial features, and painted eyes with minimal detailing. The expression is neutral and stylized, lacking the nuanced imperfections of a real person. The limbs are clearly articulated, with visible joint lines at the elbows, knees, and wrists, indicating mechanical articulation. The positioning of the limbs—especially the bent knees and forward step—is natural and anatomically plausible for a walking pose. There is no sign of unnatural stretching or deformation. These features confirm that the figure is a doll with intentional simplification and functional joint design, consistent with collectible or display dolls.",
