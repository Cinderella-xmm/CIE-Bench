      "question": "Does the text \"Catch the Wave\" appear to blend naturally with the sky without introducing any unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Catch the Wave' is placed across the upper portion of the image, overlaying the sky. It is rendered in a clean, white sans-serif font with high contrast against the light blue sky. The edges of the letters are sharp and uniform, with no visible pixelation, jaggedness, or texture mismatch that would suggest digital artifacting. In natural scenes like this, adding text typically requires careful blending to avoid disrupting the background. Here, the text appears flat and lacks any drop shadow, gradient, or anti-aliasing effects that might mimic depth or lighting—yet it does not introduce visual noise or distortions. However, the lack of subtle shadowing or transparency to match ambient lighting could be considered slightly artificial, but since there's no obvious distortion or texture clash (such as moiré patterns or color bleeding), the integration remains visually acceptable. Based on common design practices, such flat text is often used in promotional images for clarity, and while not perfectly seamless, it doesn't introduce unnatural textures. Therefore, the text blends reasonably well.",

      "question": "Does the placement of \"Catch the Wave\" maintain the structural integrity of the horizon and waves, avoiding any visual distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Catch the Wave' is positioned across the upper third of the image, just below the top edge and above the horizon line. The horizon is clearly defined by the meeting point of the sky and ocean, and the wave patterns are continuous and natural. The text does not overlap with any key features of the horizon or wave crests, nor does it obscure important elements of the seascape. Importantly, there is no warping, stretching, or bending of the ocean or sky around the text, which would indicate digital manipulation affecting structural integrity. The curvature of the waves remains consistent, and the water’s surface texture is uninterrupted beneath the text. This suggests that the text was added post-production in a way that respects the original composition. Given that the horizon remains straight and the wave motion undisturbed, the placement preserves the scene’s spatial coherence. Thus, the structural integrity is maintained.",

      "question": "Is the \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note clearly legible and aligned naturally within the bottom-left sand area, without disrupting the beach's texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Summer Adventures – 2025' is located in the bottom-left corner of the image, over the sandy beach. The font is small, white, and sans-serif, matching the style of the main title. The sand in this region has a natural granular texture with minor footprints and small mounds, typical of a beach environment. The text is overlaid directly onto this area without any apparent blending or shadowing. While the text is legible due to its contrast with the darker sand, there is no softening or transparency applied to make it appear as if it were part of the scene. As a result, the text stands out sharply, potentially creating a slight visual break in the continuity of the sand texture. However, because it is positioned in a less prominent area and does not cover significant detail, it does not severely disrupt the overall aesthetic. In graphic design, such placement is common for captions or branding, especially when minimal disruption is acceptable. Given that the text is readable and does not obscure critical details, and considering the context of promotional imagery where clarity trumps perfect integration, it can be considered naturally aligned enough.",

      "question": "Do both the \"Catch the Wave\" text and \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note seem logically placed and contextually appropriate within the beach scene, contributing positively to the overall visual narrative?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The phrase 'Catch the Wave' is thematically relevant to the image, which depicts two surfers about to enter the ocean with their boards. This slogan evokes action, adventure, and summer fun—perfectly aligning with the scene. Its placement at the top of the image draws attention immediately, functioning as a headline. The secondary text, 'Summer Adventures – 2025', is positioned in the lower-left corner, suggesting a campaign or event theme. This kind of annotation is typical in promotional materials for seasonal activities. Both texts are stylistically consistent (white, clean font) and contribute to a cohesive narrative of summer surfing. They do not distract from the main subjects but instead enhance the story by providing context. From a marketing perspective, such text placement is effective and logical. There is no contradiction between the content and the visual elements; rather, they complement each other. Therefore, both texts are contextually appropriate and enrich the image’s narrative.",

      "question": "Are the shadows and light effects around the \"Catch the Wave\" text and \"Summer Adventures – 2025\" note consistent with the lighting in the rest of the image, preserving the natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in the scene is bright and direct, indicative of midday sunlight, casting distinct shadows from the surfers onto the sand. The 'Catch the Wave' text is entirely flat, with no drop shadow, embossing, or translucency to simulate depth or interaction with light. Similarly, the 'Summer Adventures – 2025' text lacks any shading or gradient that would suggest it exists in the same three-dimensional space as the physical objects. In real-world scenarios, any object in sunlight would cast a faint shadow or reflect light differently depending on its surface. However, since these texts are purely graphical overlays and not physically present, their absence of shadow is expected in most digital compositions. That said, the lack of any light effect (such as a subtle glow or soft edge) makes them appear somewhat detached from the scene. But given that they are intended as informational or promotional text, not physical objects, their flat appearance is standard practice. As long as they don’t create visual inconsistencies (like glowing edges or incorrect shadows), they preserve the natural appearance. Since no such artifacts are present, and the lighting elsewhere is consistent, the text does not introduce unnatural effects.",
