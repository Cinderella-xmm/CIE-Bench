      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the sandcastle uniformly shaped and aligned with the original tower geometry, without any jagged or incomplete edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sandcastle is constructed from transparent crystalline elements that resemble cut gemstones or prisms. Each tower and turret appears to be composed of geometrically precise, faceted crystals arranged in a tiered, pyramidal fashion. The facets are highly reflective and exhibit consistent angularity, suggesting uniform shaping. The alignment follows the structural logic of a traditional sandcastle—turrets rise in a hierarchical pattern with decreasing size toward the top. There are no visible jagged edges or incomplete facets; instead, the surfaces appear polished and complete. The use of crystal materials implies intentional craftsmanship, which supports the idea of uniformity and precision. This contrasts with natural sandcastles (as seen in Image A), which have irregular textures due to the granular nature of sand. In Image B, the material transformation into crystal enhances symmetry and completeness, indicating careful design. Thus, the crystal facets appear uniformly shaped and properly aligned.",

      "question": "Do the gemstones replace the seashells accurately in position and size, and do they exhibit smooth, reflective surfaces without floating above the sand or water?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects scattered around the base of the crystal sandcastle include both real seashells and translucent, faceted gem-like stones. These gemstones are positioned where seashells would naturally occur in a beach scene, such as near the base of the castle and along the surface of the display. However, not all seashells are replaced by gems—the original shells remain present, and some gemstones appear alongside them. The gemstones vary in size and shape but maintain a realistic scale relative to the surrounding objects. Their surfaces are smooth and highly reflective, consistent with polished crystals. Importantly, none of the gemstones appear to float above the surface; they rest firmly on the white platform, which simulates sand. Unlike in Image A, where the shells are organic and matte, here the gemstones add a surreal, artistic layer. Despite this artistic transformation, their placement remains grounded and physically plausible within the display context. Therefore, while not every shell is replaced, those that are substituted do so accurately in terms of position, size, and grounding.",

      "question": "Is the wave pattern on the frosted glass surface continuous and flowing, with no abrupt breaks or unnatural line interruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The frosted glass panel behind the crystal sandcastle features an etched wave design that mimics ocean waves. The lines of the wave are curved and layered, forming a cresting motion typical of surf. The pattern flows smoothly from left to right, with no visible breaks or sharp discontinuities. The etching technique creates a gradient of transparency, giving depth to the wave’s form. While it is stylized rather than photorealistic, the continuity of the curves and the gradual progression of the wave's shape suggest a deliberate and coherent design. There are no jagged lines or sudden shifts in direction that would imply poor execution. Compared to Image A, where the ocean waves are dynamic and three-dimensional, this version is abstracted into two-dimensional artistry. However, within its own medium—etched glass—the wave maintains visual coherence and fluidity. The absence of interruptions indicates high-quality craftsmanship.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the display case visible and straight, with no clipping or warping of the internal elements, and do they align with the perspective of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a museum-style display case made of clear glass panels. The edges of the case are clearly visible and appear straight and linear, forming a rectangular enclosure. The internal elements—crystal sandcastle, seashells, gemstones, and frosted glass—are contained within the case without any signs of clipping or distortion. The perspective is consistent: the front of the case is flat and parallel to the viewer, while the back wall recedes appropriately, maintaining proper depth perception. There is no warping of the objects inside, nor any visual artifacts suggesting digital manipulation or misalignment. The lighting is even, and reflections are minimal, allowing for accurate spatial judgment. Compared to Image A, which is a painted scene without physical boundaries, Image B presents a structured, real-world environment where the display case serves as a framing device. The alignment of the case edges with the overall composition confirms correct spatial representation.",

      "question": "Is the red shovel with yellow handle fully visible and undistorted, lying flat on the surface without intersecting or appearing behind glass where it shouldn’t be?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red shovel with a yellow handle is positioned in the foreground of Image B, resting on the surface of the display case. It is fully visible, with no parts obscured or cut off. The shovel lies flat, with its blade slightly angled downward, consistent with being placed after use. Its reflection is visible on the glossy surface beneath, indicating it is in contact with the plane. Crucially, the shovel does not appear to be behind the glass or floating above it—it is clearly outside the display case, resting on the external surface. This positioning makes sense in a museum context: tools like shovels are often displayed externally to simulate interaction. In contrast, in Image A, the shovel is part of the beach scene, embedded in wet sand. Here, the shovel’s placement is logical and physically coherent, with no distortion or misplacement. The object is intact and correctly oriented, confirming its visibility and realism.",
