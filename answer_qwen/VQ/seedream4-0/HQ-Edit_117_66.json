      "question": "Are the edges of the jigsaw pieces smooth and interlocking without gaps or overlapping deformities?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the jigsaw pieces are analyzed for their edges. The visual cues suggest that the edges of the puzzle pieces appear smooth and interlocking without any visible gaps or overlapping deformities. This conclusion is drawn by observing the alignment and fit of the pieces around the central compass area. Common sense indicates that well-crafted jigsaw puzzles typically have such characteristics to ensure a snug fit.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the dragon patterns appear in darker wood stain and the compass area in lighter wood stain, with no abrupt or unnatural color transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows dragon patterns in a darker wood stain compared to the lighter wood stain of the compass area. There are no abrupt or unnatural color transitions between these areas, as the stains blend smoothly into the surrounding wood. Comparing this with Image A, where the entire object has a uniform leather texture and color, it's clear that Image B uses different stains to differentiate elements, which aligns with common practices in woodwork.",

      "question": "Is the wood grain texture visible and naturally varied across all puzzle pieces, without repeating patterns or artificial smoothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wood grain texture in Image B is visible across all puzzle pieces and appears naturally varied. Each piece shows unique grain patterns that do not repeat, indicating a realistic representation of wood. In contrast, Image A features a leather texture, which lacks the natural variation seen in wood grain. The analysis confirms that the texture in Image B is consistent with real wood properties.",

      "question": "Are the puzzle pieces arranged in a physically plausible scattered layout on the wooden surface, with no floating or overlapping pieces that defy gravity or perspective?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The arrangement of puzzle pieces in Image B seems physically plausible. They are scattered on the wooden surface without any floating or overlapping pieces that would defy gravity or perspective. This layout mimics how puzzle pieces might naturally fall when spread out on a table. Comparing with Image A, where the object is solid and undivided, the scattered layout in Image B adheres to the expected behavior of separate puzzle pieces.",

      "question": "Does the central compass retain its circular shape and fine internal details, with no distortion or loss of precision in the engraved lines and divisions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central compass in Image B retains its circular shape and fine internal details. The engraved lines and divisions are precise and undistorted, maintaining the integrity of the design. This observation is based on the clear visibility of the compass details, which show no signs of distortion. Compared to Image A, where the compass is part of a solid object, the precision in Image B suggests careful craftsmanship typical of detailed wood engravings.",
