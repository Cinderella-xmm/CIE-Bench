      "question": "Are the lockers in the background seamlessly replaced with mid-century modern showroom elements without visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been transformed from a traditional locker room into a sleek, modern showroom environment. The original wooden lockers have been replaced with vertical wood paneling and contemporary lighting fixtures, along with a large glass partition and minimalist furniture. The transition appears smooth, with consistent shading and texture that matches the aesthetic of a high-end interior design space. There are no visible seams, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that would suggest digital artifacts. The materials used—such as polished wood, glass, and metallic accents—are rendered with realistic gradients and reflections appropriate for a mid-century modern style. This suggests a professional-level edit where the new elements were carefully integrated to maintain visual coherence. Based on common knowledge of digital editing techniques, such seamless integration requires attention to lighting, texture mapping, and perspective alignment—all of which appear to be well-executed here.",

      "question": "Does the luxurious piece of designer furniture appear proportionally correct and physically plausible in place of the jersey display?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central area where the jersey was displayed in the original image now features a modern white sofa with gold trim and a low, circular coffee table with a reflective surface. These items are proportionally accurate relative to the human figures in the scene. The sofa's height aligns naturally with the characters' statures, and its depth does not appear distorted. The coffee table is appropriately scaled and positioned in front of the sofa, consistent with typical living room layouts. The materials—leather-like upholstery and polished metal—match the luxurious ambiance of the setting. From a design standpoint, these pieces are representative of mid-century modern aesthetics, and their placement does not violate spatial logic. Given that the characters’ positions remain unchanged, the furniture integrates plausibly into the scene without appearing oversized or misaligned.",

      "question": "Do the characters' gestures and body language remain natural and consistent with the new showroom setting and the luxurious furniture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters’ poses and gestures—particularly the man in the suit gesturing outwardly as if explaining something—remain consistent with the narrative context. In both images, he appears to be addressing the players, suggesting a discussion about strategy or performance. His posture and hand movements are fluid and natural, fitting a conversational stance. The players’ expressions and slight head tilts indicate attentiveness, which is logical in a formal or semi-formal environment like a showroom. The shift from a locker room to a showroom does not disrupt the social dynamics; instead, it elevates the tone, possibly indicating a corporate or sponsorship meeting. Since the characters’ physical actions are not dependent on the specific background details (e.g., they aren’t interacting with lockers), their body language remains appropriate and unforced. Therefore, the gesture consistency is preserved despite the environmental change.",

      "question": "Is the lighting and shadow in the showroom consistent with the new setting, without introducing any unnatural or inconsistent effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B features soft overhead recessed lights, ambient illumination from ceiling fixtures, and subtle reflections on surfaces like the coffee table and floor. These light sources create gentle shadows beneath the furniture and on the characters’ faces, consistent with indoor showroom environments. The directionality of light appears uniform and realistic, with no harsh contrasts or misplaced highlights. Shadows fall logically—under the sofa, around the legs of the characters, and on the floor—indicating a coherent light source above. Additionally, the warm tones of the wood paneling and the glow from the ceiling lights enhance the sense of depth and realism. There are no floating shadows or areas of overexposure that would suggest poor compositing. Given that lighting is one of the most critical aspects of digital scene integration, the absence of such artifacts indicates a high-quality edit.",

      "question": "Have the characters and their clothing remained visually consistent and unchanged, aside from the background and the jersey display being replaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The characters’ appearances—including facial features, hairstyles, skin tones, and clothing—are identical to those in the original image. The player in the blue jersey with number 21 retains the same facial expression, beard, and jersey design. The goalkeeper’s green kit and the suited man’s dark coat and tie are also unchanged. Notably, the jersey hanging in the original image (number 9, 'BROCATELI') has been removed and replaced by the furniture, but the characters themselves show no alterations in texture, color, or form. Their proportions and lighting on their bodies are consistent with the original, suggesting that only the background and the jersey display were modified. This level of preservation implies careful masking and layering during the editing process, ensuring that character integrity was maintained. No visible distortions or changes in fabric folds or facial details are present.",
