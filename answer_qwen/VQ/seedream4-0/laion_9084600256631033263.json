      "question": "Does the glass bottle form retain the original carâ€™s side profile and curvature without visible warping or disproportionate scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car has been transformed into a glass bottle form. The side profile and curvature of the original car are retained in the sense that the overall shape follows the contours of the car. However, the material change to glass introduces reflections and refractions that can cause some warping or distortion of these features. Despite this, the proportions seem consistent with the original car's design. The analysis is based on observing how light interacts with the glass surface and comparing it to typical car shapes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the faceted glass stoppers aligned with the original headlight positions and do they show consistent lighting and reflection patterns with the surrounding glass?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The faceted glass stoppers in Image B appear to be positioned where the headlights would typically be located on a car. They exhibit reflective properties consistent with glass, showing highlights and reflections similar to those on the rest of the glass body. This suggests they are integrated well with the surrounding glass. Comparing with Image A, the headlights were originally solid and non-reflective, so the transformation maintains alignment but changes the material properties.",

      "question": "Is the gear-shaped lid positioned centrally on the roof and securely connected to the glass body without visible seams or floating edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gear-shaped lid in Image B is centrally placed on what appears to be the roof area of the car-turned-bottle. It seems securely connected as there are no visible seams or gaps that would suggest it is floating. The connection looks smooth, indicating a seamless integration with the glass body. This conclusion is drawn from examining the edges and connections between the lid and the main body.",

      "question": "Is the embossed Datsun emblem clearly visible on the front of the glass bottle and does it maintain proper depth and clarity without surface distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed Datsun emblem in Image B is visible on the front of the glass bottle. It appears to have proper depth and clarity, maintaining its legibility despite being rendered in glass. The transparency and reflective nature of the glass do not obscure the emblem significantly. In comparison to Image A, where the emblem was likely metallic, the glass version still preserves its details effectively.",

      "question": "Does the glass body display natural reflections and highlights across its surface without abrupt transitions or artificial sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass body in Image B displays natural reflections and highlights across its surface. These effects are consistent with how light interacts with glass, creating smooth transitions without abrupt changes. The sheen appears realistic for a glass object, suggesting careful rendering to mimic real-world glass properties. This assessment is based on understanding typical glass behavior under lighting conditions.",
