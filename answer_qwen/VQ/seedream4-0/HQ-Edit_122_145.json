      "question": "Are the limbs of the chibi character straight and properly connected at joints, with no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi characters are depicted in a stylized manner typical of chibi art. The limbs appear to be proportionate for the chibi style, which often exaggerates certain features while simplifying others. There are no visible kinks or disproportionate lengths that would suggest an error in the design. The arms and legs are smoothly connected to the body without any unusual breaks or distortions.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the kimonos in Image B are vibrant and distinct, with sharp edges that separate the flowers from the background fabric.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands of the chibi characters in Image B are simplified as per the chibi art style, but they still maintain a recognizable form with five fingers. The curvature appears natural for the style, and there are no extra digits or deformed shapes present. The simplicity of the design ensures clarity.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The falling petals around the chibi characters in Image B seem to follow a general downward direction, which is consistent with the effect of gravity. They are relatively evenly distributed around the characters, with no significant clustering or floating above them. This suggests a thoughtful design to create a natural appearance.",
