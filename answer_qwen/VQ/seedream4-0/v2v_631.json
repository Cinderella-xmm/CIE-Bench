      "question": "Does the character's face retain its natural proportions and features without any visible distortion or unnatural textures after being rendered in a 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's face has been stylized into a 3D cartoon form. The facial features—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—are exaggerated in a way typical of animated characters, with large, round eyes and simplified contours. While the proportions are not anatomically accurate (e.g., the eyes are larger than life, the cheeks are rounded), this is consistent with common cartoon aesthetics. There are no visible distortions such as warping or unnatural textures on the skin surface; instead, the rendering uses smooth shading and clean geometry typical of high-quality 3D animation. Therefore, although the proportions are not 'natural' in a realistic sense, they are consistent with the intended artistic style. Given that the question asks about 'natural proportions' in the context of a cartoon style, we must interpret 'natural' as 'visually coherent within the genre.' Since the face is well-rendered and free of technical artifacts, it maintains stylistic integrity.",

      "question": "Is the character's purple hair depicted with smooth, consistent shading and texture that matches the 3D cartoon style without any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's purple hair in Image B is rendered with smooth, flowing strands and consistent color gradients, which are characteristic of polished 3D cartoon models. The lighting appears to be directional, casting subtle highlights and shadows that give volume to the hair without creating harsh edges or noise. There are no visible pixelation, clipping, or texturing errors such as seams or repeated patterns. The hair’s shape and flow match the overall stylization of the character, maintaining coherence with the cartoon aesthetic. Additionally, the hair does not appear flat or overly simplified, indicating careful attention to modeling and shading. This level of detail suggests a high-quality render suitable for a stylized character design.",

      "question": "Does the character's black outfit maintain its structural integrity and material appearance, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or loss of fine details in the 3D cartoon style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black sleeveless top worn by the character in Image B is rendered with clean lines and proper silhouette, consistent with the 3D cartoon style. The fabric appears to have a slight sheen, suggesting a smooth, possibly synthetic material like spandex or cotton blend, which is appropriate for animated characters. There are no visible mesh breaks, distorted polygons, or texturing issues such as UV mapping errors. The garment conforms naturally to the body shape without stretching or tearing, and the neckline and shoulder seams are well-defined. These visual cues indicate that the outfit has been modeled and textured properly, preserving both structural integrity and material realism within the stylized context.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the programmer-related tools or icons, such as code fragments or keyboards, integrated into the artwork in a way that complements the character and background without introducing any visual inconsistencies or unnatural placements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several elements reinforce the 'programmer' theme: floating code snippets, a keyboard in the foreground, and computer monitors displaying syntax-highlighted code in the background. These elements are positioned logically around the character, appearing to float or be part of a digital interface, which aligns with a futuristic or tech-themed environment. The code fragments are styled with syntax highlighting (e.g., colors for keywords, strings), enhancing their authenticity. The keyboard is partially visible and placed realistically in front of the character, suggesting an active workspace. The background screens show plausible code, contributing to the narrative without overwhelming the central figure. There are no misplaced objects or conflicting perspectives; everything integrates cohesively within the scene. This careful composition supports the thematic intent without introducing visual dissonance.",

      "question": "Do the title banner and nameplate feature crisp, polished borders that match the purple and black color scheme, contributing to the visual coherence of the character card without any distracting or inconsistent elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner at the top of Image B displays the word 'Programer' (note: misspelled as 'Programer') in a stylized font, set against a metallic ribbon with gold trim and a glowing purple outline. The border is sharp and well-defined, with reflective highlights that suggest a polished, premium design. Below, the nameplate at the bottom features similar ornamental framing with glowing accents, matching the purple and gold theme. Both elements use consistent materials and lighting effects that harmonize with the overall aesthetic of the character card. Despite the spelling error, the visual design remains cohesive and professional. The borders do not appear jagged or low-resolution, and there are no visual glitches or mismatched textures. Thus, while there is a textual flaw, the visual design of the banners and nameplate is polished and contributes positively to the card’s aesthetic.",
