      "question": "Does the chibi-style illustration of the dog retain its distinct characteristics without unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog is rendered in a simplified, chibi-style cartoon form. Despite the stylization, key features such as the black coat, floppy ears, closed eyes indicating sleep, and relaxed posture are preserved. The silhouette and proportions remain consistent with a realistic dog, even though facial details like individual whiskers or fur texture are omitted—this is typical in minimalist illustrations. The absence of unnatural textures (like pixelation or smudging) and the smooth shading suggest intentional design choices rather than degradation. While fine details like paw pads or subtle musculature are abstracted, they are not lost in a way that compromises recognition. Therefore, the essential identity of the dog is retained in a stylized manner, aligning with common practices in chibi art.",

      "question": "Does the bold white outline around the illustration enhance visual clarity without disrupting structural coherence or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bold white outline in Image B serves as a clear boundary separating the illustration from the transparent background. This technique is commonly used in sticker designs to improve visibility and give a 'cut-out' effect. The outline is uniformly applied around all elements—dog, bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag—and follows their shapes accurately, preserving structural integrity. There are no jagged edges, overlapping inconsistencies, or visual glitches that would suggest artifacts. Instead, the outline enhances legibility and gives a clean, polished look. It does not distort or obscure any part of the illustration, maintaining coherence across the entire composition. Thus, it improves clarity without compromising the design’s harmony.",

      "question": "Do the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag maintain structural consistency and visual credibility in their minimalist flat design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, each object—the bench, radio, juice box, and trash bag—is depicted using a flat design aesthetic with minimal shading and uniform colors. The bench retains recognizable features: slatted backrest, armrests, and metal legs, albeit simplified. The radio has two speakers, a central display, and an antenna, all proportionally placed to reflect real-world objects. The juice box includes a cap and label, and the trash bag is shown tied at the top with folds suggesting volume. While these are stylized, they remain structurally consistent with their real counterparts. The lack of complex textures or gradients does not undermine credibility; instead, it adheres to the conventions of flat vector art. No element appears misshapen or implausible, so the overall design remains visually coherent and believable within its artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the extension of the dog and bench slightly beyond the circular frame preserve natural appearance and avoid distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular frame in Image B contains most of the scene but allows parts of the dog's front paws and the bench's left leg to extend slightly outside. This slight overflow is intentional and common in sticker designs to prevent cropping artifacts and maintain natural proportions. The extended portions do not appear stretched or warped; instead, they follow the original shape smoothly. This design choice avoids artificial truncation, which could otherwise make the image look clipped or awkward. Since the extension is minimal and consistent with the object's geometry, it preserves the natural appearance without introducing distortion. This technique enhances realism by mimicking how physical stickers might interact with surfaces.",

      "question": "Does the transparent background maintain the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the sticker?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent background in Image B is indicated by the checkerboard pattern, which is standard in digital graphics to represent transparency. This allows the sticker to be placed on various backgrounds without a visible border, enhancing versatility. The transparency does not interfere with the visual elements; instead, it supports the sticker-like quality by making it appear as if it could be physically applied anywhere. The white outline provides contrast against any backdrop, ensuring readability. Because the design is self-contained and cleanly isolated, the transparent background contributes to a professional and authentic sticker appearance. It avoids the artificiality of a solid background while preserving the intended aesthetic.",
