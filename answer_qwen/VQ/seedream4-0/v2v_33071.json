      "question": "Does the snow on the clock tower appear naturally accumulated without disrupting the structural integrity of the tower?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow appears to be evenly distributed on the horizontal surfaces of the clock tower, such as the roof and balcony. This even distribution suggests natural accumulation due to gravity. There are no visible signs of excessive weight or damage that would indicate disruption to the tower's structure. The icicles hanging from the edges further support the idea of natural snowfall and melting processes.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the icy patterns on the flags visually credible and detailed, without introducing unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The icy patterns on the flags exhibit a realistic appearance with intricate details resembling ice crystals. These patterns are consistent with how ice forms on fabric in cold conditions. The transparency and light refraction effects also add to the credibility of the icy texture, making it visually believable.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials and textures of the clock tower retain their natural appearance despite the added snow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The underlying materials and textures of the clock tower, such as the green paint and wooden elements, are still discernible beneath the snow. The snow does not obscure these features entirely but rather sits atop them, maintaining the natural look of the tower. The contrast between the snow and the tower's surface enhances this perception.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the clock face and tower preserved without distortion or damage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clock face and the overall shape of the tower remain intact and undistorted. The snow and ice do not alter the fundamental geometry of these structures. The clock hands, numbers, and other details are clearly visible, indicating that the shapes have been preserved.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the fine details of the clock tower and flags been preserved without any loss or introduction of unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details of the clock tower, such as the clock face, architectural elements, and flags, are well-preserved. The addition of snow and ice has not introduced any unnatural artifacts or distortions. The details remain sharp and coherent, contributing to the overall realism of the image.",
