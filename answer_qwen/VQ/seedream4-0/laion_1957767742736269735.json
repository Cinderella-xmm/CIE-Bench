      "question": "Are the olive and dark green LEGO bricks covering the tank's body uniformly aligned and textured, without visible gaps, misaligned blocks, or distorted shapes that break the geometric structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tank is constructed from LEGO bricks, and its body is primarily composed of olive and dark green pieces. Upon close inspection, the bricks appear to be generally well-aligned, forming a consistent pattern across the hull and turret. However, due to the nature of LEGO construction, some minor irregularities in alignment are expected, especially around curved surfaces like the turret. The texture is blocky but uniform, as expected for LEGO models. There are no obvious large gaps or severely misaligned blocks that would compromise the overall geometric integrity. While not perfectly seamless like real metal, the construction adheres closely to the original tank’s shape, maintaining structural coherence. Therefore, based on visual analysis and common knowledge about LEGO builds, the alignment and texture are reasonably consistent.",

      "question": "Does the colorful LEGO tiger pattern on the front hull maintain the correct proportions and facial features of the original tiger decal, without distortion or missing elements such as eyes, teeth, or stripes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO tiger decal on the front hull is rendered using multicolored bricks in orange, white, black, blue, and yellow. Comparing it to typical LEGO art techniques, the design captures the general outline and aggressive expression of the tiger, including prominent eyes, open mouth with sharp teeth, and striped patterns. However, due to the pixelated nature of LEGO bricks, the proportions are slightly altered—especially in the eyes and jawline—which appear more angular and less fluid than in the original painted version. Some finer details like individual whiskers or subtle shading may be missing. Nevertheless, all key facial features (eyes, teeth, stripes) are present and recognizable. The artistic style is adapted to LEGO constraints, but it remains faithful enough to the original design. Thus, while not perfect, it maintains essential features without significant distortion.",

      "question": "Do the LEGO treads exhibit consistent, detailed texture resembling real tank tracks, with no flattened sections or incorrect spacing between the individual tread segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO treads are constructed using interlocking gray and metallic-colored bricks designed to mimic real tank tracks. The segments are arranged in a repeating pattern that closely resembles the links of actual tank tracks. Each segment appears to have proper spacing and curvature, following the contour of the wheels beneath. There are no visible flattened areas or gaps where the tread should connect. The detail level is high, with individual 'links' clearly defined, which is consistent with advanced LEGO engineering seen in large-scale models. Given that LEGO sets often include specialized track pieces for military vehicles, this model uses them effectively. The texture is realistic within the medium’s limitations. No major flaws in spacing or flattening are observed.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO tank fully supported by a smooth, continuous wooden platform that matches the surrounding ground level, with no floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO tank rests on a light-colored wooden platform that appears to be made of polished wood planks. The platform is flat and extends evenly under the entire base of the tank, providing full support. Its edges are clean and flush with the ground surface, and there is no indication of floating or uneven placement. The transition between the platform and the grassy area is natural, with no visible gaps or misalignment. This suggests careful installation, likely intended for display purposes. The platform also reflects light consistently, indicating a smooth finish. Based on visual cues and standard display practices, the platform supports the model properly and integrates well into the environment.",

      "question": "Does the green LEGO brick back panel blend seamlessly with the surrounding environment, showing no sharp edges, unnatural color shifts, or textural inconsistencies compared to the real foliage?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green LEGO brick panel behind the tank is constructed from standard green LEGO bricks arranged in a grid pattern. While it mimics foliage, it does not blend naturally with the real trees and bushes in the background. The panel has sharp, straight edges and a uniform, pixelated texture that contrasts sharply with the organic, varied textures of real leaves. Additionally, the color is a solid, artificial green, lacking the depth and variation seen in natural vegetation. There are noticeable boundaries between the LEGO wall and the actual environment, creating a visual discontinuity. This indicates that the panel is an intentional backdrop rather than a seamless integration. Therefore, despite its aesthetic purpose, it fails to blend realistically with the surroundings.",
