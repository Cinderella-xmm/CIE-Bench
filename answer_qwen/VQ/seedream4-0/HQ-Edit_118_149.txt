    "Question": "Q1: Are the pastel-colored areas of the dancer's leotard and tights smoothly blended without visible color artifacts or unnatural transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pastel-colored areas on the dancer’s leotard and tights are composed of geometric shapes with sharp edges and distinct boundaries. These shapes do not blend smoothly but rather form a mosaic-like pattern. This is evident from the clear lines separating each shape, which indicates that the colors are not smoothly transitioning into one another. The visual cues suggest an artistic style rather than a realistic depiction.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the detachable sections around the dancer’s leg maintain consistent thickness and alignment with the leg’s natural curvature, avoiding floating or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "The detachable sections in Image B appear as geometric shapes that follow the contour of the dancer’s leg. However, these shapes have uniform thickness and do not align perfectly with the natural curvature of the leg. They seem to float slightly away from the leg due to their rigid, angular nature, which does not conform to the smooth curves of a human limb. This suggests that while they are somewhat aligned, they do not maintain perfect consistency with the leg’s curvature.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the angular transformations applied to the dancer’s limbs physically plausible, with joints and limbs maintaining correct anatomical relationships and no exaggerated bends?",
    "explanation": "The angular transformations in Image B result in limbs composed of polygonal segments. While the overall posture of the dancer is recognizable, the sharp angles at the joints and the segmented appearance of the limbs deviate from natural anatomy. The joints do not exhibit smooth curves typical of human movement, leading to an exaggerated and stylized look that is not physically plausible in a real-world context.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the edges of the dancer’s sticker figures cleanly integrated onto the journal surface, with shadows and lighting matching the surrounding environment?",
    "explanation": "The edges of the dancer’s stickers in Image B appear clean and well-defined against the journal surface. There are no visible gaps or overlaps that would suggest poor integration. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the stickers seem consistent with the lighting on the journal, indicating that the stickers are well-integrated into the scene. The visual cues suggest careful placement and attention to detail in the design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the dancer’s hands retain five fingers each, with natural spacing and proportions, and no fused or extra digits?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the dancer are depicted with a simplified geometric design. Each hand appears to have five distinct finger-like extensions, but due to the angular and abstract nature of the design, it is difficult to assess natural spacing and proportions accurately. However, there are no obvious signs of fused or extra digits, and the number of fingers seems consistent with a normal human hand. The design prioritizes artistic representation over anatomical accuracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
