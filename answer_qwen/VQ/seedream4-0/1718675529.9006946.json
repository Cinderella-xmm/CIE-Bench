      "question": "Do the wave patterns along the shoreline consist of smooth, continuous geometric curves without jagged or disconnected segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wave patterns along the shoreline are depicted with smooth, continuous geometric curves. The waves are stylized with clean lines and rounded shapes that flow seamlessly into each other without any jagged or disconnected segments. This is evident from the visual cues of the wave crests and troughs which maintain a consistent form throughout the image. The artistic style emphasizes simplicity and uniformity in the wave design.",

      "question": "Are the palm trees along the right side of the beach represented as clean, straight vertical lines without irregular gaps or misplaced branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees along the right side of the beach in Image B are represented as clean, straight vertical lines. Each tree has a uniform trunk and branches that extend outward in a regular pattern. There are no irregular gaps or misplaced branches visible; the design adheres to a geometric and symmetrical aesthetic typical of stylized illustrations. The consistency in their depiction suggests a deliberate choice to simplify and idealize the natural forms.",

      "question": "Are the clouds in the sky arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns without visible distortion or mismatched edges between adjacent cloud shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The clouds in the sky of Image B are arranged in symmetrical, repeating patterns. They follow a consistent shape and size, creating a harmonious sequence across the sky. There is no visible distortion or mismatched edges between adjacent cloud shapes, indicating a deliberate design choice to achieve a balanced and orderly appearance. This type of arrangement is common in stylized or graphic representations of landscapes.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire scene in Image B is uniformly rendered in muted greens, blues, and warm oranges. These colors are consistently applied throughout the image, contributing to a cohesive and harmonious palette. There are no areas exhibiting bright or out-of-place colors such as vivid cyan or yellow. The color scheme appears carefully chosen to evoke a serene and tropical atmosphere, aligning with the overall artistic style.",

      "question": "Do the rocks on the sandy shore appear proportionally consistent with the surrounding terrain, and are they positioned in a way that aligns with the slope and texture of the beach?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rocks on the sandy shore in Image B appear proportionally consistent with the surrounding terrain. They are positioned in a way that aligns with the slope and texture of the beach, maintaining a realistic relationship with the environment. The size and placement of the rocks suggest an intentional effort to integrate them naturally into the scene, enhancing the realism despite the stylized nature of the illustration.",
