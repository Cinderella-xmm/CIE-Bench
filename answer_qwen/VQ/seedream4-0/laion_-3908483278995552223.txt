    "Question": "Q1: Does the 3D model of the Aquatic warrior maintain accurate limb proportions and body structure without distorted joints or exaggerated features?",
    "explanation": "The analysis of the 3D model in Image B shows that the limbs appear proportionate to the human anatomy, with no visible distortion or exaggeration. The joints such as elbows, knees, and shoulders seem correctly positioned and structured. This conclusion is drawn by comparing the visual cues of the model's limbs with common knowledge of human body proportions.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic blue surfaces of the armor rendered with natural light reflections and depth, avoiding flat or uniform coloring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the metallic blue surfaces exhibit variations in shading and highlights, suggesting light reflections and depth. These details indicate a non-uniform color application, which aligns with how real-world metallic surfaces interact with light. This assessment is based on observing the gradient and reflective qualities typical of polished metal textures.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

    "Question": "Q3: Is the trident positioned correctly in the hand and scaled appropriately relative to the figure, without bending or truncation?",
    "explanation": "The trident in Image B appears to be held naturally in the character's hand, with its size proportional to the figure. There are no signs of bending or truncation; it looks like a well-integrated part of the scene. This conclusion is reached by evaluating the alignment and scale of the trident in relation to the character's arm and overall stature.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Does the dome enclosing the model have smooth curvature and consistent transparency without visible stitching, warping, or reflection anomalies?",
    "explanation": "The dome in Image B displays a smooth, continuous curve with consistent transparency. There are no apparent stitches, warps, or unusual reflections that would disrupt the visual integrity of the glass-like material. This assessment is made by examining the dome's surface for any irregularities that might suggest poor rendering quality.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the coral reef base textured with natural-looking organic patterns and scaled appropriately to support the model without appearing undersized or oversized?",
    "explanation": "The coral reef base in Image B has varied textures resembling natural corals, with appropriate scaling relative to the model. It neither overwhelms nor diminishes the figure, providing a realistic foundation. This conclusion is derived from observing the detailed textures and the proportional relationship between the base and the model.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the swirling ocean currents around the model follow continuous, directional flow paths without abrupt breaks or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "The ocean currents in Image B flow smoothly around the model, maintaining continuity and directionality. There are no abrupt breaks or isolated fragments, indicating a coherent design. This analysis is based on tracing the flow lines and ensuring they form a logical pattern around the figure.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Does the hand holding the trident have exactly five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure, without extra digits or unnatural bends?",
    "explanation": "The hand gripping the trident in Image B clearly shows five fingers with natural joint angles and grip pressure. There are no additional fingers or unnatural bends, suggesting a realistic representation. This conclusion is reached by closely inspecting the hand's structure and comparing it to typical human hand anatomy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q8: Are all elements (model, dome, base, currents) spatially aligned and layered correctly, with no floating or disconnected parts?",
    "explanation": "All elements in Image B are well-aligned and layered, creating a cohesive composition. The model, dome, base, and currents integrate seamlessly without any floating or disconnected parts. This assessment involves checking the spatial relationships and layering of each component to ensure they contribute to a unified scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
