      "question": "Does the 3D cartoon style of the thermometer maintain its structural consistency without introducing unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thermometer in Image B is rendered in a 3D cartoon style. The circular shape of the gauge and the linear arrangement of the temperature markings are consistent with real-world thermometers, suggesting that the design maintains structural consistency. There are no visible distortions or broken geometric shapes; the needle, dial, and frame all appear intact and proportionate. This conclusion is drawn by observing the uniformity and coherence of the visual elements.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the soft lighting effects on the thermometer's metallic surface natural, enhancing its finish without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic surface of the thermometer in Image B exhibits soft lighting effects that enhance its finish. These reflections and highlights appear smooth and natural, contributing to the perception of a polished metal texture. There are no unnatural textures or loss of fine details, as the light interacts realistically with the surface, maintaining clarity and definition. This analysis is based on the observation of how light typically behaves on metallic surfaces in real life.",

      "question": "Do the added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] appear naturally integrated into the design without causing visual clutter or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The added stats [Temperature Range +200] and [Accuracy +10°C] are placed below the main gauge in Image B. They are integrated into the design using a clean font and a contrasting background, which makes them easily readable without causing visual clutter. The placement does not disrupt the overall layout or introduce distortion, ensuring that the information is clear and accessible. This assessment considers the balance between providing necessary information and maintaining a clean design.",

      "question": "Are the title banner and nameplate text elements positioned logically and clearly visible, contributing to the overall visual credibility without disrupting the layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner 'Precision Thermal Gauge' and the nameplate text elements in Image B are positioned logically at the top and bottom of the image, respectively. They are clearly visible and contribute to the overall visual credibility by providing context and specifications. The positioning respects the spatial hierarchy, ensuring that these elements do not disrupt the layout of the central thermometer. This evaluation is based on principles of good design and readability.",

      "question": "Do the crisp borders and cool-toned background complement the thermometer's function and appearance, maintaining a professional and authentic look without introducing visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crisp borders and cool-toned background in Image B complement the thermometer's function and appearance. The clean lines and professional color scheme enhance the authenticity of the design, making it look both modern and reliable. There are no visual artifacts present, and the overall aesthetic supports the intended purpose of the thermometer. This conclusion is reached by considering how design elements can influence the perceived quality and professionalism of an object.",
