    "Question": "Q1: Does the glass display case surrounding the elephant have clear, smooth edges without visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural reflections?",
    "explanation": "The glass display case in Image B appears to be transparent with clean, straight edges that are consistent with typical high-quality glass enclosures. There are no visible scratches, smudges, or distortions along the frame. The reflections on the glass surfaces are subtle and realistic, showing soft highlights from ambient lighting without any exaggerated or unnatural glares. The corners of the case are sharp and well-defined, suggesting precision manufacturing. Additionally, the way light interacts with the glass—especially around the edges—shows minimal refraction anomalies, which supports the conclusion that the edges are smooth and artifact-free. Based on visual cues and common knowledge about glass display cases used in museum or collector settings, this one appears professionally rendered and free of digital artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the metallic resin details on the elephant’s armor consistently textured and reflective, showing no unnatural glossiness or broken patterns?",
    "explanation": "The metallic armor on the elephant in Image B features intricate embossed patterns that resemble traditional Southeast Asian or Indian decorative styles. The surface reflects light in a way that is consistent with polished metal, such as brass or bronze, but without over-saturation or unrealistic shine. The textures appear uniform across the chest plate, shoulder guards, and leg bands, with fine detailing that suggests hand-crafted craftsmanship. There are no visible breaks in the pattern or abrupt transitions in reflectivity that would suggest digital rendering errors. The way shadows fall on the armor indicates a coherent surface normal map, supporting the consistency of texture and material properties. This level of detail aligns with what one might expect from a high-quality collectible sculpture made from metallic resin. Therefore, the armor shows natural reflectivity and consistent texturing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the silk-gold banners located at the four corners of the glass case, properly anchored, and displaying natural fabric draping and color variation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, there are two gold-colored silk banners visible—one on the left and one on the right—draped over the top corners of the glass case. These banners hang down with soft folds and gentle curves, indicating realistic gravity-driven draping. The fabric appears to have slight variations in tone, likely due to lighting and material sheen, which adds depth and authenticity. However, only two banners are present, not four. The absence of banners at the front and back corners contradicts the description of 'four corners.' Furthermore, while the draping looks natural, the anchoring points appear slightly simplistic—there's no visible hardware or tacking mechanism, which could be considered an oversight in realism. Given that the prompt specifies 'four corners,' and only two banners are visible, the condition fails the requirement for completeness. Thus, despite the natural appearance of the fabric itself, the setup does not fully meet the described criteria.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the layered mountain silhouettes in the background show gradual opacity and depth, with no sharp edges or inconsistent transparency levels?",
    "explanation": "The background of Image B features stylized mountain silhouettes behind the glass case. These mountains are rendered with varying levels of opacity, creating a sense of atmospheric perspective. The closest peaks are more defined and opaque, while those further back become progressively lighter and blurrier, simulating haze or mist. This technique mimics real-world depth perception where distant objects lose contrast and clarity. There are no abrupt transitions between layers; instead, the fade is smooth and continuous. The edges of the mountains are softly blended rather than sharply cut, avoiding any artificial look. This method is commonly used in both physical dioramas and digital art to enhance depth. The overall effect is consistent with professional design standards for background scenery in display environments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the bonsai-like trees at the foreground edges realistically integrated into the rocky surface, with natural leaf textures and root placement?",
    "explanation": "At the bottom corners of the display case in Image B, two small bonsai-style trees are placed on rocky bases. These trees feature detailed foliage with individual leaves that appear textured and varied in shape, resembling real miniature trees. The trunks are gnarled and twisted, consistent with aged bonsai specimens. The roots are partially exposed and embedded into moss-covered stones, which adds to the realism. The integration into the rocky surface seems deliberate and natural, with no floating or misaligned elements. Lighting casts soft shadows beneath the trees, reinforcing their three-dimensional presence within the scene. While these are likely digital renderings, they adhere closely to botanical accuracy and aesthetic principles of bonsai cultivation. The attention to detail in leaf structure, bark texture, and root anchoring supports the conclusion that they are realistically integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"
