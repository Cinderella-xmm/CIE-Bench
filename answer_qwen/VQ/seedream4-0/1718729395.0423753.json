      "question": "Does the angel's facial skin retain smooth, consistent texture and natural coloration without artificial halos, pixelation, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The angel's facial skin in Image B appears to have a soft, lifelike texture with subtle gradations in tone that mimic natural human skin. The lighting is warm and directional, coming from above and slightly behind, which casts gentle shadows under the cheekbones and nose, enhancing depth without creating harsh contrasts. There are no visible signs of pixelation or digital artifacts. The highlights on the forehead and cheeks are softly blended and follow the contours of the face, suggesting a natural reflection of light rather than artificial glares. The skin tone is consistent across the face, with slight variations due to shading that align with anatomical features like the bridge of the nose and jawline. These visual cues, combined with common knowledge about realistic human skin rendering in classical art and digital painting, support the conclusion that the facial skin maintains natural appearance.",

      "question": "Are the added ornate garments visually integrated with the figure’s body, showing realistic draping, fold depth, and material consistency without floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The garments in Image B are richly detailed, featuring dark fabric with golden embroidery and layered textures. The folds of the clothing appear to follow the contours of the body naturally, particularly around the shoulders and arms, where the fabric gathers and drapes in a way consistent with gravity and textile behavior. The lighting emphasizes the three-dimensionality of the folds, with highlights and shadows that suggest volume and thickness. The golden trim follows the edges of the garment smoothly, and there are no visible floating sections or gaps between the fabric and the body. The integration of the garment with the figure is seamless, with no visual disconnects, and the material appears consistent throughout—rich, possibly velvet-like, with reflective qualities appropriate for gold-threaded embellishments. This level of detail and coherence suggests a high degree of realism in the rendering, supported by artistic conventions seen in Renaissance-style religious paintings.",

      "question": "Do the gold accents on the wings appear as subtle, layered highlights that follow the natural curvature of the feathers without creating sharp, unnatural glares or breaking feather edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold accents on the wings in Image B are applied selectively along the leading edges of the feathers, following their natural curve and taper. These highlights are not uniformly bright but instead vary in intensity, mimicking how light might reflect off metallic surfaces embedded in feathers. The gold appears as if it were gilded in thin layers, giving a sense of depth and luminosity without overpowering the white base of the feathers. There are no sharp, jagged edges or sudden glare points that would suggest digital overprocessing. Instead, the transition between gold and white is smooth, with soft gradients that enhance the texture without distorting the feather structure. This approach aligns with traditional techniques used in religious iconography, where gold leaf is used to symbolize divinity while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Therefore, the gold accents are well-integrated and naturalistic.",

      "question": "Is the transition between the angel’s figure and the new celestial background smooth, with consistent lighting direction and no abrupt edges or mismatched depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a dramatic celestial scene with clouds, stars, and nebulae, suggesting a heavenly realm. The lighting in this background is warm and radiant, emanating from the upper right, which corresponds to the direction of the light illuminating the angel’s face and wings. This consistency in lighting direction enhances the sense of unity between the figure and the environment. The edges of the angel’s form blend into the background through soft transitions, especially around the wings and hair, where light diffusion creates a halo effect that merges with the glowing sky. There are no hard lines or abrupt cuts that would indicate poor compositing. Depth cues such as atmospheric perspective (fainter, softer clouds in the distance) and layering of clouds contribute to a cohesive spatial relationship. The overall composition feels harmonious, with the angel appearing to emerge naturally from the celestial setting, supported by principles of classical composition and chiaroscuro.",

      "question": "Do the hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, proper shadowing, and skin texture without swelling, extra digits, or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the angel’s hands are clasped together near the chest. Both hands clearly display five fingers each, with natural proportions and correct joint alignment. The knuckles and finger joints are well-defined, and the shadows beneath the fingers and between them follow realistic lighting patterns, consistent with the overhead light source. The skin texture appears smooth and continuous, without any signs of swelling, distortion, or additional digits. The positioning of the hands—slightly curled, palms facing inward—suggests a gesture of reverence or prayer, which is typical in religious iconography. The rendering of the hands is anatomically accurate, with attention to detail in fingernails, skin creases, and subtle shading that gives them volume. There are no visible artifacts or distortions that would suggest digital manipulation errors. Thus, the hands are rendered realistically and naturally.",
