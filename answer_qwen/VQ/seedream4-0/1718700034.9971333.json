      "question": "Are the crystal shards forming the wings symmetrically aligned and structurally coherent, without visible gaps, misaligned facets, or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wings appear to be composed of multiple shards that are arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The alignment seems consistent on both sides, suggesting careful design. There are no apparent gaps between the shards, and their facets align well with each other, maintaining structural coherence. The geometry of the crystals looks intentional and undistorted, contributing to an aesthetically pleasing appearance.",

      "question": "Do the golden leafy strands follow the natural flow of the original hair and appear integrated without floating or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden leafy strands in Image B seem to follow the contours of the hair, giving the impression that they are part of it. They do not appear to float or disconnect from the hair, which suggests a seamless integration. The placement and curvature of the leaves match the natural flow of the hair, enhancing the overall realism of the image.",

      "question": "Does the shirt display a uniform, soft velvet texture with natural shadowing and no repeating patterns or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shirt in Image B exhibits a uniform texture that resembles soft velvet. The lighting creates subtle shadows that enhance the three-dimensional look of the fabric. There are no visible repeating patterns or digital artifacts, indicating a high-quality rendering that mimics real-world materials accurately.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the background a consistent deep gray wall with no visible edges, lighting anomalies, or remnants of the original scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a deep gray color that appears consistent throughout. There are no visible edges or transitions that would suggest remnants of another scene. The lighting is even, with no anomalies that disrupt the uniformity of the background, providing a clean and distraction-free backdrop for the subject.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are all edited elements—crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt—properly aligned with the body and each other, without clipping, overlapping errors, or positional distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal wings, leafy hair, and velvet shirt are all aligned correctly with the body. The wings extend naturally from the shoulders, the leaves integrate smoothly with the hair, and the shirt fits properly. There are no signs of clipping or overlapping errors, and the positioning of these elements relative to each other appears accurate and free from distortion.",
