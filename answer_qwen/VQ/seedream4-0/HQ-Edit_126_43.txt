    "Question": "Q1: Is the monocled eye on the front face of the clock seamlessly integrated into the original frame, with no visible seam or texture discontinuity around its perimeter?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the central feature of the robot-like figure is a large, circular monocled eye embedded in the front face of what appears to be a repurposed clock. The eye is encased in a brass-like rim and surrounded by gearwork and ornamental detailing that matches the steampunk aesthetic. Upon close inspection, the integration of the eye into the structure appears seamless—the surrounding metalwork flows naturally around it without visible gaps or texture breaks. The shading and highlights suggest a continuous surface, with reflections and depth consistent with the rest of the metallic components. There is no evidence of digital stitching or mismatched textures, indicating careful design and rendering. This suggests that the eye was conceived as an integral part of the overall structure rather than a later addition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the gear-like limbs extend from the side panels of the clock with continuous material flow and geometric alignment, showing no signs of floating or disconnected joints?",
    "explanation": "The limbs of the robot in Image B emerge from the sides of the main body, which is derived from the clock’s structure. These limbs are constructed from articulated gears, pistons, and jointed segments made of brass and copper materials. Each limb connects directly to the side panels via robust mechanical joints that appear
