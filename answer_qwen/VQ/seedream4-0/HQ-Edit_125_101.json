      "question": "Does the 3D ballerina figure inside the snow globe maintain anatomically correct proportions and joint alignment, matching the original dancer's pose without exaggerated or broken limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ballerina figure inside the snow globe is depicted in a classical ballet pose, with one leg extended high in an arabesque and arms gracefully positioned. Upon close inspection, the figure’s limbs appear proportionate and aligned in a way consistent with human anatomy. The joints—such as the knee, ankle, and elbow—are bent naturally, and the spine maintains a realistic curvature. There are no visible distortions such as elongated limbs, misplaced joints, or unnatural angles. The pose mirrors typical ballet technique, suggesting careful modeling to preserve anatomical accuracy. While stylized for artistic effect (e.g., slightly elongated torso), it does not exhibit exaggerated or broken limbs. This conclusion is supported by general knowledge of ballet sculpture and figurine design, which often aim for idealized yet anatomically plausible forms.",

      "question": "Does the base of the snow globe display realistic bronze texture with subtle reflective highlights and clearly defined engraved French script, without pixelation or synthetic-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe appears to be crafted from a material resembling aged bronze, featuring a warm metallic tone with a matte finish interspersed with soft reflective highlights that suggest depth and realism. The surface shows fine textural details consistent with cast metalwork, including minor imperfections and grain that enhance authenticity. The engraved script on the base reads 'Ballet France' and other partially visible words, rendered in elegant cursive lettering. These inscriptions are sharp and well-defined, showing no signs of pixelation or artificial repetition. The lighting interacts naturally with the surface, creating gentle gradients and specular reflections that align with how real bronze would behave under diffuse light. This level of detail suggests high-quality rendering or physical craftsmanship, avoiding the telltale flatness or uniformity seen in low-resolution digital artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the snowflakes inside the globe evenly dispersed and varied in shape and size, appearing to float naturally without repeating patterns or clumping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, numerous snowflakes are visible, each individually designed with distinct six-pointed crystalline structures. They vary in size and orientation, contributing to a sense of natural randomness. The distribution across the glass sphere appears even, with no noticeable clustering or gaps that would suggest artificial arrangement. There is no evidence of repeating identical patterns, which could indicate digital replication. Instead, the flakes seem to float at different depths, creating a layered effect that enhances realism. This variation and dispersion align with expectations of how snowflakes behave in a shaken snow globe—each flake unique and moving independently. Based on common knowledge of snow globes and physics of suspended particles, this depiction reflects a plausible and aesthetically pleasing simulation.",

      "question": "Are the Eiffel Tower and surrounding Parisian landmarks scaled down appropriately and geometrically intact, maintaining correct perspective and structural details without warping or flattening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Eiffel Tower within the snow globe is accurately modeled with its iconic lattice structure, tapering form, and detailed iron framework. It is proportionally scaled relative to the ballerina figure and other miniature buildings, consistent with typical snow globe design where architectural elements are reduced but preserved in fidelity. Surrounding landmarks—including what appear to be Notre-Dame Cathedral and other Parisian-style buildings—are also rendered with recognizable silhouettes and architectural features like domes and spires. The perspective is correctly maintained, with objects appearing smaller as they recede into the background, suggesting depth. There is no visible warping, flattening, or distortion of geometry; all structures retain their three-dimensional integrity. This attention to scale and detail is consistent with high-quality collectible snow globes, which strive for accurate miniaturization of real-world scenes.",

      "question": "Does the glass dome of the snow globe exhibit natural refraction and subtle bending of internal elements, with smooth curvature and no jagged edges or abrupt transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome of the snow globe is perfectly spherical, with a smooth, continuous surface that reflects light uniformly. Internal elements—such as the ballerina, Eiffel Tower, and snowflakes—appear slightly distorted due to refraction, as expected when viewing objects through curved glass. This distortion is subtle and consistent with optical physics: straight lines near the edges curve gently, and light bends realistically around the periphery. The transition from the glass to the interior is seamless, with no visible seams, jagged edges, or digital artifacts. Reflections on the outer surface are soft and diffused, indicating a polished, transparent material. The overall visual effect is one of clarity and realism, typical of high-quality glassware. Given that real snow globes use precision-molded glass, this depiction adheres closely to physical behavior, avoiding any synthetic or artificial appearance.",
