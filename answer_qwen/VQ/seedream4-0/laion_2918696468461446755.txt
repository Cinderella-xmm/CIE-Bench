    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the trench coats and fedoras on all characters appear to have natural fabric draping. The folds and shadows suggest a proper fit around their limbs without any visible distortion or clipping. The visual cues such as the way the fabric hangs and the consistent shading imply that the artist paid attention to realistic rendering of clothing. There is no indication of unnatural stretching or compression that would suggest poor fitting.",
