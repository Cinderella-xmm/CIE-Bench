      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Do the curled horn-like structures on both armrests have smooth, continuous curves without jagged edges or inconsistent thickness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The analysis of the horn-like structures reveals that they are indeed smooth and continuous. The visual cues show a uniform curvature with no visible jagged edges or inconsistencies in thickness. This conclusion is drawn from observing the natural flow and evenness of the horns' design, which aligns with common artistic representations of such features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bark-textured scales on the backrest evenly distributed, with natural variations in shape and depth, and do they follow the original contour of the sofa without tearing or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bark-textured scales appear to be evenly distributed across the backrest, showing natural variations in shape and depth. They seem to follow the contours of the sofa smoothly, maintaining alignment with its structure. This assessment is based on the observation that the texture mimics natural tree bark patterns, which typically exhibit such characteristics.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the mossy, leafy mane extend continuously from the top of the cushions, showing layered depth and natural variation in green tones, without sharp seams or floating leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mossy, leafy mane appears to extend seamlessly from the top of the cushions, displaying layered depth and a natural variation in green tones. There are no noticeable sharp seams or floating leaves, suggesting a well-executed integration of the foliage into the design. This conclusion is reached by examining the continuity and natural appearance of the greenery.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the emerald eyes positioned centrally above the middle cushion, emitting a soft, diffused glow that casts subtle shadows on the surrounding leather without harsh outlines or overexposure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald eyes are centrally located above the middle cushion and emit a soft, diffused glow. The glow creates subtle shadows on the surrounding area, enhancing the three-dimensional effect without causing harsh outlines or overexposure. This analysis is based on the visual impact of the lighting and shadow effects, which contribute to a realistic and immersive appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the wooden limbs extend from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet, with vines wrapped around clawed ends that appear structurally sound and proportionate to the sofa's size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden limbs extend naturally from under the front edge of the sofa, resting firmly on the carpet. The claws at the ends are wrapped with vines, giving them a structurally sound and proportionate appearance relative to the sofa's size. This conclusion is derived from observing the limbs' integration with the sofa and their realistic depiction as part of the overall design.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are there faint, localized glows or energy effects near the limbs or eyes that blend into the environment without creating visible artifacts like pixelation or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "There are indeed faint, localized glows or energy effects near the limbs and eyes. These effects blend seamlessly into the environment, avoiding visible artifacts such as pixelation or unnatural color bleeding. This assessment is based on the smooth transition of light and color in these areas, contributing to an overall cohesive and polished look.",
