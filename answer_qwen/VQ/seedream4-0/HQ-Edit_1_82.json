        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the gymnast's limbs appear to maintain natural joint angles and proportional lengths. The arms are extended in a manner consistent with typical gymnastic poses, and the legs show no exaggerated bends or missing segments. The proportions seem balanced and realistic for human anatomy.",
