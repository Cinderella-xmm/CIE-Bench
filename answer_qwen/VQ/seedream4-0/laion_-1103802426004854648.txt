    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seahorse's body is made of translucent pink glass with a smooth, uniform appearance. The surface exhibits subtle bubble-like textures that are evenly distributed, consistent with the natural imperfections often found in hand-blown or molded glass. These bubbles are small and rounded, enhancing the realism of the material without appearing jagged or artificially applied. There are no visible seams, distortions, or irregularities in texture that would suggest digital manipulation or poor rendering. The translucency allows light to pass through smoothly, creating soft gradients and depth, which aligns with the physical properties of glass. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge about glass craftsmanship, the texture appears natural and consistent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The yellow belly in Image B is rendered as a smooth, opaque glass surface with a glossy finish, indicating high-quality material representation. Inside the belly, a music note is enclosed within a heart shape. The symbol is clearly etched or embedded into the glass, with sharp, clean edges and no signs of blurring or deformation. The color contrast between the yellow background and the pink heart with golden musical notes is well-defined, suggesting precise detailing. The lighting reflects uniformly across the surface, reinforcing the idea of a smooth, polished glass texture. There is no evidence of pixelation or distortion, which supports the conclusion that the design is accurately rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The ribbons on the head and fins are depicted as solid lavender-colored glass elements with smooth surfaces. They exhibit proper light reflections and refractions consistent with transparent or semi-transparent materials. The shapes of the ribbons maintain their intended form—curved and layered—without any warping, stretching, or flattening. The edges are well-defined, and the transparency suggests a realistic glass composition rather than a fabric or plastic substitute. The way light interacts with the ribbons (e.g., highlights and shadows) indicates careful modeling and rendering, preserving their original design integrity. This consistency in form and material behavior supports the conclusion that they are realistically portrayed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The seahorse is positioned on a flat, reflective black surface that acts as a base. This surface shows clear mirror-like reflections of the lower portion of the seahorse, including its tail and part of the belly. The reflection is sharp and symmetrical, indicating a highly polished, possibly acrylic or glass material. The stand is seamlessly integrated with the seahorse’s base, with no visible gaps or floating effects. The alignment is precise, and the shadow beneath the stand is soft but consistent with the lighting direction, suggesting a professional setup. The integration of the base and the object appears natural and physically plausible.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "All elements in Image B—the body, belly, fins, ribbons, and base—are rendered with consistent lighting, shadowing, and material properties. The lighting source appears to come from above and slightly in front, casting soft shadows and creating highlights that follow the curvature of each component. The materials (translucent glass for the body, opaque glass for the belly, and reflective black base) interact with light in a physically accurate manner. There are no mismatched highlights, sudden color shifts, or artificial edges that would suggest poor blending or digital artifacts. The transitions between materials are smooth, and the overall image has a cohesive, photorealistic quality. This level of consistency across all parts indicates high-quality rendering and attention to detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"
