      "question": "Does the collectible figure design on the dresser maintain structural coherence and appear naturally integrated into the existing scene without introducing any unnatural artifacts or textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure on the dresser in Image B is a stylized, cartoon-like character with smooth, rounded features and a glossy finish. The figure appears to be digitally rendered or placed into the scene, as its surface texture contrasts subtly with the matte finish of the surrounding objects like the keyboard, mouse, and books. However, there are no visible seams, pixelation, or distortions that would suggest poor integration. The lighting on the figure matches the ambient light in the room—soft and diffused from the window—indicating careful rendering. Its shadow falls naturally beneath it, consistent with the light source. While the figure’s aesthetic is distinctly different (more playful and stylized), it does not introduce any obvious artifacts such as jagged edges, unnatural reflections, or texture mismatches. Therefore, despite its stylistic contrast, the figure maintains structural coherence within the digital environment.",

      "question": "Are the proportion and physical rationality of the collectible figure design consistent with the surrounding elements on the dresser, ensuring it does not appear distorted or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure is positioned on the right side of the dresser and stands upright. Its height appears comparable to that of the keyboard and mouse, which are standard-sized peripherals. Given that typical keyboards are about 45 cm long and 12–15 cm tall, the figure's height seems plausible at roughly 20–25 cm. This is consistent with common collectible figurines (e.g., Funko Pop! style). The proportions of the figure—head size relative to body, limbs, and torso—are exaggerated in a cartoonish manner but remain internally coherent and balanced. It does not appear stretched, compressed, or warped. Furthermore, its placement next to the keyboard and mouse creates a natural spatial relationship; it doesn’t obstruct or dominate the space disproportionately. Thus, while stylistically distinct, the figure adheres to realistic physical scale and spatial logic within the scene.",

      "question": "Does the color scheme of the collectible figure design blend naturally with the existing elements on the dresser, maintaining the overall sense of reality and avoiding any jarring contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure features a black suit, white shirt, and black shoes, with a pale skin tone and dark hair. These colors align well with the dominant monochrome palette of the room—black furniture, dark gray walls, and neutral tones from the rug and bedding. The black suit echoes the dresser and mirror frame, creating visual harmony. The white shirt complements the white keyboard and the light-colored wall, adding subtle contrast without disruption. Although the figure’s exaggerated facial features and bright eyes stand out due to their stylization, they do not clash with the overall aesthetic. The use of simple, clean colors avoids chromatic dissonance. While the figure introduces a playful element, its color scheme remains compatible with the modern, minimalist decor of the room, preserving the scene’s realism and cohesion.",

      "question": "Are the fine details and textures of the collectible figure design well-preserved, matching the quality and style of the other objects on the dresser, thus avoiding any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure exhibits clear, sharp details such as defined facial features, clothing folds, and smooth surface finishes. The texture appears uniformly matte with subtle highlights, consistent with high-quality 3D rendering. There is no visible aliasing, blurring, or noise in the model. The material looks like polished plastic or resin, typical for collectible figures. When compared to the keyboard and mouse, which have textured surfaces (e.g., keycaps, rubber grips), the figure’s smoother finish is still appropriate given its nature. The rendering quality matches the rest of the image, suggesting it was integrated with care. No unnatural textures such as overly shiny spots or inconsistent shading are present. Therefore, the fine details and textures are preserved well and are consistent with the overall high fidelity of the scene.",

      "question": "Does the composition and layout of the collectible figure design on the dresser appear logically placed, enhancing the scene's overall visual credibility without disrupting the existing arrangement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The collectible figure is positioned on the far right of the dresser, near the edge but not overhanging. This placement allows it to be visually prominent without blocking access to the drawer or interfering with the functional items (keyboard, mouse, books) on the left. The arrangement follows a natural balance: the heavier, more structured objects (books, keyboard) are grouped together, while the figure acts as a decorative accent. Its position complements the vertical line of the plant beside it, creating a layered visual flow from left to right. The figure does not disrupt the symmetry or functionality of the desk setup. Moreover, it adds personality to an otherwise utilitarian space, enhancing the scene’s narrative without appearing forced or misplaced. The overall composition feels intentional and credible within the context of a personalized workspace.",
