    "Question": "Q1: Does the transformed exercising figure maintain its structural consistency without any unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the exercising figure is depicted as a cartoon potato character in a gym setting. The figure has a consistent shape with smooth contours and symmetrical limbs, wearing sneakers, socks, and a green headband. Its posture—walking on a treadmill—aligns with typical human-like movement patterns, even though it's anthropomorphized. The proportions of the body (arms, legs, torso) are balanced and proportionate to each other, with no visible warping, pixelation, or distortion. The chain and keyring attached above the figure are seamlessly integrated into the composition without interfering with the character’s form. Based on visual inspection and common sense about cartoon design, such stylization is acceptable and does not introduce unnatural artifacts. Therefore, the figure maintains structural consistency.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the interactions between the transformed sleeping figure and the cardboard box natural, without any unnatural textures or loss of details?",
    "explanation": "The sleeping figure in the bottom-left panel of Image B is shown lying inside a cardboard box, which functions as a makeshift bed. The potato character is positioned comfortably on a pillow with eyes closed, suggesting sleep. The box has visible flaps, texture lines, and a small flower near the corner, indicating attention to detail. The character’s body fits naturally within the box, with no clipping or deformation. The shading and lighting suggest depth and volume, contributing to a realistic interaction between the figure and its environment. There are no signs of texture loss, blurring, or unnatural edges. Given that this is a stylized comic illustration, the level of detail is appropriate and coherent with the artistic style. Thus, the interaction appears natural.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the transformed eating figure at the table appear authentic and free from any visual anomalies, with a natural posture and table items?",
    "explanation": "The eating figure in the bottom-right panel of Image B shows the potato character seated at a small round table, holding a spoon and drinking from a cup. The posture is relaxed and plausible for someone eating. The table contains a bowl, a spoon, a napkin, and a small container labeled 'SALT', all rendered clearly and logically arranged. The character’s arms and hands are proportionally correct and interact naturally with the objects. The background is minimal, keeping focus on the scene. There are no visual anomalies such as floating objects, misaligned limbs, or inconsistent lighting. The overall depiction aligns with common representations of mealtime scenes in cartoons. Hence, the figure and its surroundings appear authentic and visually coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold ink outlines and vibrant flat colors in the comic book panel enhance the visual appeal without disrupting the natural appearance and visual coherence?",
    "explanation": "Image B uses a classic comic book art style characterized by bold black outlines and flat, vibrant colors. These stylistic choices are intentional and widely used in cartoon illustrations to create clarity and visual impact. The outlines define shapes precisely, preventing ambiguity in forms like the potato character, gym equipment, and furniture. The flat colors are evenly distributed without gradients or shadows, which is typical for this genre. While this style deviates from photorealism, it enhances visual appeal by making elements easily distinguishable and aesthetically pleasing. Importantly, the style does not disrupt coherence—it maintains logical spatial relationships and object integrity. Therefore, despite being stylized, the visual language supports rather than undermines the narrative and structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the distinct zones for each activity in the comic book panel visually plausible and structurally coherent, without introducing any distortions?",
    "explanation": "Image B is divided into three panels: top (gym), bottom-left (sleeping), and bottom-right (eating). Each panel represents a different activity zone, separated by clear borders. The gym scene includes realistic fitness equipment (barbell, bench, punching bag), placed in a logically arranged room with perspective and depth. The sleeping scene shows a cardboard box repurposed as a bed, which is a creative but plausible setup. The eating scene is simple yet complete, with a table and utensils. All three zones are internally consistent and do not overlap or interfere with each other. The transitions between panels are clean, and there are no distortions such as warped perspectives or conflicting spatial logic. The layout follows standard comic strip conventions, ensuring structural coherence. Thus, the zoning is both visually plausible and well-structured.",
    "answer": "Yes"
