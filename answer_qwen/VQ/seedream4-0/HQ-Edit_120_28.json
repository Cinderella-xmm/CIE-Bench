      "question": "Is the treasure chest still geometrically intact and proportionally consistent with its original form when placed on the newly added weathered map background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the treasure chest is depicted in a monochrome sketch style, centered on an aged parchment-like map background. The chest retains its classic arched-top, rectangular base structure with visible rivets, metal bands, and a ring handle—consistent with traditional pirate treasure chests. Its proportions appear balanced and symmetrical, with no apparent distortion or scaling issues. Despite being rendered in line art rather than full color, the geometry of the chest remains faithful to typical representations of such objects. The perspective is slightly angled but maintains proper foreshortening, suggesting it was carefully drawn to preserve realism within the artistic medium. There is no indication of warping or disproportionate scaling relative to the surrounding elements like the rope border or compass rose. Therefore, the chest's form is geometrically intact and proportionally consistent.",

      "question": "Do the ropes used as decorative borders maintain their natural fiber texture and realistic coil shapes without appearing stretched, flattened, or unnaturally contorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ropes forming the border in Image B are stylized as thick, twisted strands, consistent with nautical themes. They appear to be drawn with deliberate hatching and shading to simulate the texture of natural fiber. The coils at the corners are tightly wound and exhibit a spiral pattern that mimics real rope twisting. While not photorealistic, the artistic rendering preserves the general shape and structural integrity of rope, with consistent thickness and curvature throughout. There are no visible signs of stretching, flattening, or unnatural kinks that would suggest digital manipulation errors. The ropes integrate well with the overall hand-drawn aesthetic and maintain a believable representation of coiled marine rope. Thus, they retain a realistic appearance appropriate for the illustrative style.",

      "question": "Are the symbols and ancient-style text in the legend aligned properly with the overall lighting and depth of the image, and do they appear cleanly rendered without jagged edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legend in the upper-left corner contains various icons (coins, gems, vases) and a block of stylized text reading 'LERERE'. These elements are rendered in dark ink against the parchment background, using a consistent line weight and style that matches the rest of the drawing. The symbols are clearly defined with clean outlines and no visible pixelation or jagged edges, indicating high-resolution rendering. The lighting across the image is flat due to the 2D nature of the illustration, so there is no actual shadowing or depth variation affecting alignment. However, the placement of the legend is logical and does not clash with other elements. The text and symbols are evenly spaced and uniformly styled, suggesting careful design. There is no evidence of color bleeding or anti-aliasing artifacts, which supports a professional quality of rendering. Hence, the legend appears properly integrated and cleanly executed.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the compass rose in the bottom-right corner have consistent metallic sheen and shadowing that aligns with the lighting direction and material properties of the surrounding gold coins and gems?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The compass rose in Image B is rendered with a combination of metallic textures, featuring a golden outer ring and silver inner star-shaped component. It includes subtle gradients and highlights that suggest a reflective surface. However, since the entire image is in a monochrome sketch style with selective coloring only on certain elements (like the compass), the lighting effects are limited. The compass does show directional highlights consistent with light coming from the upper left, matching the general illumination implied by the sunlit areas in the original image (though not present here). The shadows under the compass are soft and follow the same tonal logic as the other shaded elements. While not fully photorealistic, the shading and sheen are coherent with the artistic style and plausible for a metallic object. The gold coins nearby share similar warm tones and reflectivity cues, reinforcing consistency. Therefore, despite stylistic simplification, the compass’s appearance aligns reasonably with expected material properties and lighting direction.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the sea monster motifs seamlessly blended into the map background, maintaining consistent line thickness and shading with the rest of the ink drawings, and do they not appear as disjointed or misplaced elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sea monster motifs—stylized serpentine creatures—are drawn in the same fine-line ink style as the rest of the map details. They are positioned along the lower portion of the parchment, partially beneath the treasure chest and near the compass. Their line work matches the thin, delicate strokes used for landmasses and ship illustrations, and the shading is minimal but consistent with the overall low-contrast aesthetic. There are no abrupt changes in stroke width or tone that would suggest they were added separately or poorly integrated. The monsters appear to emerge organically from the water regions of the map, fitting the traditional cartographic trope of mythical sea creatures. They are not overlaid awkwardly nor do they conflict with other elements; instead, they enhance the thematic coherence of the image. This indicates seamless integration within the artistic framework.",
