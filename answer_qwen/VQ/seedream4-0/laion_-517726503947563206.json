      "question": "Does the hull of the ship display smooth, consistent translucency and iridescent color shifts across its surface without blocky or repeated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hull of the ship in Image B is composed of numerous faceted crystal-like structures that reflect light in a way that creates iridescent color shifts. These facets are arranged in a geometric pattern, giving the appearance of a crystalline lattice. While the overall effect is visually striking and translucent, the surface is not smooth but rather segmented into distinct polygonal shapes. This segmentation results in a repetitive, blocky pattern rather than a seamless, continuous translucency. The reflections and color shifts are consistent with how light interacts with faceted crystals, but the presence of these repeating geometric forms indicates a structured, non-uniform surface. Therefore, the hull does not exhibit smooth, consistent translucency without blocky patterns.",

      "question": "Are the windows on the ship's decks replaced with clearly defined, faceted gem-like shapes that reflect light naturally and maintain consistent depth and edge sharpness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the windows on the ship's decks have been transformed into faceted, gem-like structures. These shapes are clearly defined, with sharp edges and multiple reflective surfaces that mimic the appearance of cut gems. The facets catch and refract light in a manner consistent with real crystal optics, producing natural-looking highlights and color dispersion. Each window maintains a consistent depth and angular precision, contributing to a cohesive and realistic crystalline aesthetic. There is no visible blurring or distortion, and the edges remain crisp throughout. This transformation aligns well with the intended artistic vision of a crystal ship, where the windows serve both as functional elements and decorative features.",

      "question": "Do the deck surfaces appear as continuous, structured crystal pathways with no floating pieces, cracks, or abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The deck surfaces in Image B are designed to resemble crystal pathways, with a structured layout of interlocking crystal segments. However, upon close inspection, there are noticeable floating crystal fragments near the bow and stern, particularly around the edges of the ship. These fragments do not appear to be integrated into the main structure and seem to hover above the water, suggesting a lack of proper anchoring. Additionally, some areas show abrupt transitions between crystal and non-crystal materials, such as the walkways that appear to be made of solid white material rather than crystal. These inconsistencies break the illusion of a fully crystalline ship and introduce visual discontinuities. Therefore, the deck surfaces do not maintain a seamless, continuous crystal structure.",

      "question": "Is the superstructure of the ship transformed into angular, faceted crystal forms with clean edges and correct proportions, without warped or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The superstructure of the ship in Image B has been reimagined with angular, faceted crystal forms. These elements include the dome-like structure at the top, the masts, and various architectural details, all rendered in a crystalline style. The edges are sharp and well-defined, and the proportions appear to be consistent with the overall scale of the ship. There is no visible warping or collapse in the geometry; instead, the forms maintain structural integrity and symmetry. The use of geometric precision suggests careful digital modeling, and the reflection of light across the facets supports the idea of a coherent, three-dimensional crystal construction. Thus, the superstructure successfully transforms into a believable crystalline form without geometric distortions.",

      "question": "Has the background been adjusted to a minimalistic horizon with softened or removed distant islands, while maintaining a smooth transition between the water and sky without visual breaks or mismatches in brightness?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background features a simplified horizon with fewer and more distant islands compared to the original scene. The islands that remain are smaller and less detailed, contributing to a more minimalistic composition. The water and sky transition smoothly, with no visible seams or abrupt changes in brightness. The lighting appears consistent, with soft gradients from the sky to the water, enhancing the serene atmosphere. There are no visual breaks or mismatches in tone or exposure, indicating careful post-processing to ensure harmony between elements. This adjustment aligns with the artistic intent of focusing attention on the crystal ship by reducing environmental distractions.",

      "question": "Is the crystal ship positioned correctly on the water surface with no floating portions or misaligned base, and does it maintain proper scale relative to the surrounding water and horizon?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal ship in Image B is positioned on the water surface with a clear reflection beneath it, indicating contact with the water. However, certain parts of the ship, particularly the lower sections near the bow and stern, appear to float slightly above the waterline, lacking a natural displacement effect. The base of the ship does not show any signs of submersion or wave interaction that would suggest it is properly anchored in the water. Additionally, the scale of the ship relative to the surrounding environment seems exaggerated; it dominates the frame disproportionately, which may indicate an intentional artistic choice but still deviates from realistic proportions. While the reflection is present, the absence of ripples or water disturbance around the hull suggests a lack of physical interaction with the water. Therefore, the ship’s positioning is not entirely accurate.",

      "question": "Are the crystal surfaces free from repetitive textures, blurred edges, or ghosting effects that suggest digital artifacts or poor synthesis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The crystal surfaces in Image B exhibit a high level of detail, with each facet reflecting light in a way that suggests careful rendering. However, upon closer inspection, some areas show subtle repetition in the texture patterns, especially in the larger crystal panels. These repetitions can be seen in the way certain facets mirror each other too perfectly, indicating possible tiling or cloning artifacts. Additionally, there are minor instances of ghosting—faint duplicate outlines near the edges of the crystal structures—likely due to compositing errors during the editing process. While most edges are sharp, a few softer transitions suggest blending issues. These imperfections, though small, point to digital artifacts that compromise the realism of the crystal surfaces.",
