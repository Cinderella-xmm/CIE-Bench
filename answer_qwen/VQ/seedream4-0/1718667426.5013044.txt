    "Question": "Q1: Does the ogre's body have simplified yet coherent proportions with no distorted limbs or unnatural joint angles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the ogre is depicted in a stylized, cartoonish design typical of collectible figurines or animated characters. Its body proportions are exaggerated but consistent with common artistic conventions for such characters—muscular build, large head, and broad shoulders. The limbs are proportionally balanced; the arms and legs are symmetrical and articulated at natural joint angles (elbows, knees). There is no visible distortion, such as bent joints in impossible ways or disproportionate limb lengths. The simplification is intentional for aesthetic appeal and manufacturability in toy design, but it maintains coherence with recognizable humanoid anatomy. This aligns with world knowledge about stylized character design in animation and collectibles, where simplification enhances visual clarity without sacrificing structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the surface of the ogre’s body and clothing uniformly matte with no shiny reflections or residual skin texture?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the ogre in Image B appears to be rendered with a uniform matte finish, typical of plastic or resin figurines. There are no specular highlights or glossy reflections that would suggest a shiny material. The skin has smooth, solid green coloring without fine textural details like pores or wrinkles, which supports the idea of a simplified, non-organic surface. Clothing elements such as the skirt and arm bands also lack reflective qualities and show consistent shading, indicating a matte texture. While some subtle depth is present due to lighting, there are no signs of residual skin texture or unwanted glossiness. This matches expectations for 3D-rendered collectible models designed to mimic painted plastic toys.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the foam club visibly softer in edge definition, larger in scale, and held securely in the ogre’s right hand without deformation?",
    "explanation": "The foam club in Image B is clearly depicted with soft, fuzzy edges, consistent with a sponge-like or padded material. Its scale is significantly larger than anatomically realistic, which is common in stylized designs to emphasize power or humor. It is held firmly in the ogre’s right hand, with fingers wrapped around the handle in a natural grip. There is no visible deformation of the club or the hand—no bending, stretching, or clipping. The interaction between the hand and the object appears physically plausible within the context of the cartoon style. This aligns with world knowledge about exaggerated props in fantasy figurines, where size and texture are used for visual impact while maintaining functional form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the fur-trimmed cape attached at the shoulders, extending downward without clipping into the body or appearing detached?",
    "explanation": "The cape in Image B is clearly attached at the shoulder area, draping over the back and sides of the ogre. It extends downward naturally, following the contours of the figure without intersecting or clipping through the body. The fur trim along the edge is consistent and well-defined, suggesting proper attachment. There are no gaps, floating sections, or unnatural folds that would imply detachment. In 3D modeling and figurine design, such accessories must be carefully rigged to avoid mesh penetration. The visual evidence here indicates a properly integrated cape, adhering to standard practices in character modeling for collectibles.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the rocky base fully grounded, with the plaque clearly engraved and readable, and no floating or shadow inconsistency?",
    "explanation": "The rocky base in Image B is positioned directly on the ground surface, showing full contact with the terrain. The plaque embedded in the base is clearly visible, with legible engraving reading 'Mighty Ogre'. The text is sharp and evenly spaced, with no blurring or distortion. Shadows cast by the base and the figurine are consistent with the light source from above-left, showing no floating or misaligned shadows. The base appears stable and integrated into the scene, with no visual cues suggesting it is hovering or improperly placed. This level of detail is typical in high-quality renderings of collectible figures, where grounding and readability are essential for presentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
