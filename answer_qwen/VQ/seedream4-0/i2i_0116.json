      "question": "Does the figurine accurately retain the character's detailed features like facial structure, costume texture, and arm guards without unnatural alterations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine of Loki is displayed in a transparent case. The facial structure closely resembles Tom Hiddleston’s portrayal of Loki, with accurate details such as the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth, as well as the long dark hair styled similarly to the character's appearance in the films. The costume includes green accents, gold armor on the chest and arms, and black leather-like material, all of which are consistent with Loki’s iconic outfit from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The textures appear well-defined—especially the metallic sheen on the arm guards and the stitching on the jacket—indicating high-quality craftsmanship. There are no visible distortions or unnatural modifications to the facial features or costume elements. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of the character’s design, the figurine faithfully reproduces the character’s appearance.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the transparent display box clean and sharp without any jagged or blurred lines affecting the clarity of the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transparent display box in Image B appears to be made of acrylic or glass, commonly used for collectible displays. Upon close inspection, the edges of the box are straight and precise, with no visible jaggedness or blurring. The seams between panels are minimal and smooth, suggesting professional manufacturing. The clarity of the box allows for an unobstructed view of the figurine, and there are no pixelation or distortion artifacts that would suggest digital manipulation or poor image quality. This level of precision is typical of high-quality display cases designed for collectibles. Therefore, the edges are clean and sharp.",

      "question": "Do the shadows and reflections on the transparent display box correspond logically to the light source, avoiding unnatural or inconsistent lighting effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lighting appears to come from above and slightly in front of the display, as indicated by the soft shadow cast beneath the base of the box and the subtle highlights on the top edges of the acrylic. Reflections on the surface of the box are minimal but present, particularly on the front panel, where faint glares suggest overhead ambient lighting. These reflections are consistent with indoor lighting conditions, such as those found in an office or home setting. There are no abrupt or unnatural shadows, nor are there conflicting light directions (e.g., shadows pointing in multiple directions). The overall lighting is coherent and realistic, matching common expectations for a photograph taken under controlled indoor lighting. Thus, the shadows and reflections align logically with a single primary light source.",

      "question": "Is the desk surface smooth and consistent, with no unusual distortions or artifacts where the transparent display box rests on it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The desk surface in Image B is white and flat, with a uniform texture that suggests a standard office desk material such as laminate or painted wood. The area directly beneath the display box shows no warping, discoloration, or digital artifacts. The edges of the box sit flush against the surface, and there are no visible gaps or distortions that would indicate misalignment or image manipulation. Additionally, the reflection of the box on the desk is minimal and natural, consistent with a non-glossy surface. There is no evidence of stretching, pixelation, or other anomalies near the base of the box. Given these observations, the desk surface appears smooth and consistent.",

      "question": "Does the scale of the figurine relative to the transparent display box and the desk appear appropriate and proportional, avoiding exaggerated or reduced sizes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine in Image B is positioned inside a tall, rectangular display box that extends slightly above and below the figure. The proportions of the box are consistent with typical display cases for life-sized busts or half-body statues, which are often around 18–24 inches tall. The figurine itself appears to be approximately torso-length, which is typical for collectible busts. Its size relative to the desk and surrounding objects (such as a keyboard and monitor partially visible in the background) suggests it is proportionally scaled. For example, the height of the box is comparable to the height of standard desktop items, indicating that the figurine is not oversized or undersized. There is no indication of forced perspective or scaling errors that would make it appear unnaturally large or small. Therefore, the scale is appropriate and proportional.",
