      "question": "Do the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal appear to naturally integrate with the warm red and gold hues of the book and pitcher without disrupting the overall color harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal in Image B are set against a warm gradient background that transitions from deep amber to soft cream. The red and gold hues of these objects harmonize well with the background, creating a cohesive color palette. The colors of the book and pitcher in Image A also feature warm tones, which would naturally integrate with the LEGO figure and mythical animal if they were placed in the same scene. The overall color harmony is maintained without disruption.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the proportions and sizes of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal logically consistent with the scale of the book and pitcher, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal are displayed within a transparent glass cube, suggesting a controlled scale relative to each other. Comparing this to the book and pitcher in Image A, the proportions seem consistent as both sets of objects are designed to be visually balanced within their respective frames. There is no indication of distortion or unrealistic scaling in either image when considering the objects' intended scales.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials and textures of the Classic LEGO minifigure and the mythical animal in Image B appear smooth and detailed, typical of high-quality LEGO models. The glossy finish on the mythical animal and the matte texture of the minifigure are consistent with common LEGO designs. In Image A, the book and pitcher exhibit fine details and realistic textures. Both images maintain natural appearances without unnatural artifacts.",
