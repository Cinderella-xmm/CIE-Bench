      "question": "Does the seaside café tabletop setting blend naturally with the table surface, avoiding any noticeable break in texture or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the seaside café tabletop setting appears to seamlessly integrate with the table surface. The reflection of the sea waves and sunlight on the table creates a continuous texture that mimics water's fluidity. There are no abrupt changes in texture or lighting that would suggest a break between the table and the reflected scene. This blending is achieved through careful attention to light and shadow, ensuring that the visual elements flow naturally.",

      "question": "Are the shapes and proportions of sea waves and sunlight reflections accurately depicted, maintaining structural consistency without unnatural breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shapes and proportions of the sea waves and sunlight reflections in Image B seem accurately depicted. The waves follow natural patterns of motion and curvature, while the sunlight reflections maintain consistent brightness and direction. There are no visible distortions or unnatural breaks that disrupt the structural consistency of the scene, suggesting a high level of detail and realism in the depiction.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the materials of the seaside elements, such as the table, sea waves, and sunlight reflections, appear authentic, free from unnatural textures and visual artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials of the seaside elements in Image B appear authentic. The table's reflective surface convincingly imitates water, capturing the movement and texture of sea waves. Sunlight reflections also look genuine, with no noticeable artifacts or textures that would detract from the authenticity. The overall effect is one of seamless integration, where each element contributes to a believable representation of a seaside scene.",

      "question": "Are the sunlight reflections on the sea waves consistent with the sun's expected position, maintaining physical logic and visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunlight reflections on the sea waves in Image B are consistent with the expected position of the sun. The highlights and glints on the waves align logically with the direction of incoming light, creating a realistic portrayal of how sunlight interacts with moving water. This adherence to physical logic enhances the visual credibility of the scene, making it appear natural and well-composed.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of the seaside café setting in Image B fits naturally on the tabletop. The placement of the chairs and the perspective of the beach and ocean create a cohesive image that feels like an extension of the real world. There are no distracting or misplaced elements that disrupt the visual coherence, allowing the viewer to fully immerse in the tranquil seaside atmosphere.",
