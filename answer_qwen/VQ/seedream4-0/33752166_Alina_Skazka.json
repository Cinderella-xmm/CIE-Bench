      "question": "Do the arm-like appendages formed from the balconies maintain consistent proportions and smooth joints without jagged edges or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building has been digitally transformed into a giant robot-like structure. The balconies of the original building have been reimagined as mechanical limbs, specifically arms. These 'arms' are constructed from what appear to be extended balcony sections, with visible joints and articulated segments. Upon close inspection, the transitions between segments are not perfectly smooth; there are noticeable sharp angles and abrupt changes in direction that resemble digital stitching rather than natural mechanical articulation. Additionally, the proportions of the arms—especially their width relative to the torso—are inconsistent with realistic biomechanics. The joints lack the smooth curvature expected in functional robotic limbs, and some edges appear jagged or pixelated, suggesting digital manipulation artifacts. This indicates that the design prioritizes visual impact over anatomical or mechanical plausibility.",

      "question": "Are the glowing panels uniformly distributed across the window positions and do they emit light in a way that blends seamlessly with the surrounding surfaces without harsh halos or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing panels in Image B are placed where windows and balconies were in the original building. These panels emit a bright blue light, resembling LED displays or energy sources within a mecha design. However, their distribution is uneven—some panels are larger or brighter than others, particularly on the upper torso and head-like section. The glow does not blend naturally with the surrounding metallic surfaces; instead, it creates sharp contrasts and halo effects around the edges, especially noticeable against darker areas. There are also visible pixelation artifacts along the borders of the glowing regions, indicating low-resolution rendering or post-processing issues. In contrast, real-world lighting would diffuse more evenly and softly. Therefore, the illumination lacks realism and seamless integration.",

      "question": "Do the circuit patterns run along plausible structural lines (e.g., edges, corners) and exhibit consistent thickness and color without appearing as random overlays or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circuit patterns in Image B are overlaid on various parts of the robotized building, particularly along the limbs, torso, and joints. These patterns follow some logical paths—such as running along edges and seams—suggesting an attempt at realism. However, upon closer examination, many of the circuits appear as flat, two-dimensional graphics rather than three-dimensional integrated components. The thickness varies inconsistently across different sections, and the color scheme (primarily white and blue) is uniform but lacks depth and variation that would suggest actual electrical pathways. Some lines terminate abruptly or intersect illogically, resembling random digital overlays rather than engineered systems. While they contribute to a futuristic aesthetic, they fail to convincingly simulate real circuitry due to these inconsistencies and artificial appearance.",

      "question": "Are the dynamic parts at the edges of the building connected to the main structure through visible mechanical links, and do they follow realistic pivot points without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dynamic parts in Image B—such as the arms and legs—are clearly attached to the central body of the building-robot. Mechanical linkages like hinges, rods, and joint mechanisms are visible at key connection points, such as the shoulders and hips. These links appear to follow plausible pivot points, with rotational axes aligned with structural joints. For instance, the elbow and knee areas show articulated segments that suggest movement capability. However, some components, particularly near the fingertips and feet, seem slightly disconnected or misaligned, lacking clear anchoring points. There are also instances where parts appear to float slightly above the base structure, possibly due to rendering limitations. While most connections are believable, minor misalignments reduce overall realism. Thus, while the majority of the mechanics are well-integrated, not all components adhere strictly to physical plausibility.",

      "question": "Are the exposed gears positioned at structural junctions and scaled appropriately relative to the building’s height and width, without appearing oversized or misaligned with surrounding features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The exposed gears in Image B are located at critical junctions such as elbows, knees, and the neck area, which aligns with typical mechanical engineering principles for stress distribution and articulation. Their placement suggests intentional design to imply functionality. However, when compared to the scale of the entire structure—which is derived from a multi-story residential building—the gears appear disproportionately large. A gear large enough to be visibly detailed at this distance would be impractical for a structure of this size unless it were part of a fictional or exaggerated design. Furthermore, some gears are misaligned with adjacent components, such as being off-center or overlapping improperly with other mechanical parts. This suggests either artistic license or technical inaccuracies in scaling. While the positioning is generally logical, the sizing and alignment issues undermine realism.",
