    "Question": "Q1: Does the added kneeling figure have five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no distorted joints?",
    "explanation": "The kneeling figure in Step 2 is a simplified, stylized silhouette of a human form, depicted in white with blue outlines. It lacks detailed anatomical features such as individual fingers or defined joints. Instead, it uses abstract, rounded shapes to represent hands and limbs. Given that this is a minimalist representation intended for instructional clarity rather than anatomical accuracy, the figure does not show five distinct fingers or natural hand shapes. The hands are represented as simple ovals or rounded blobs without any indication of digits or joint structure. Therefore, based on visual analysis and understanding of illustrative conventions used in instructional diagrams (where simplification is common), the figure does not meet the criteria for having five fingers or natural hand shapes.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the legs and torso of the leaping figure properly extended and aligned to reflect forward momentum without broken or warped limbs?",
    "explanation": "In Step 1, the leaping figure is shown mid-air with dynamic motion lines suggesting forward momentum. The legs are extended—one bent at the knee and the other straight—creating a classic leap pose typical in anime-style action scenes. The torso is angled forward, consistent with the direction of movement, and there are no visible distortions or warping in the limbs. The proportions of the arms and legs appear balanced and anatomically plausible within the exaggerated style of the character design. While the style is stylized, the limbs maintain smooth curves and correct alignment, indicating proper extension and posture to reflect forward motion. There are no signs of broken or malformed limbs, which would be evident if joints were misaligned or limbs appeared stretched unnaturally. Thus, the figure’s pose accurately reflects forward momentum without deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the knees tucked tightly toward the chest with natural curvature and no visible deformation in the leg muscles?",
    "explanation": "In Step 3, the figure is depicted in a seated position with knees drawn up toward the chest, resembling a crouched or tucked posture. The knees are positioned close to the torso, and the thighs are bent at realistic angles. The leg muscles appear well-defined but not deformed; the curvature of the thighs and calves follows natural anatomical contours. The illustration maintains consistent proportions and shading to suggest muscle tension without exaggeration or distortion. Although the style is cartoonish, the depiction adheres to basic principles of human anatomy during a tuck maneuver. There are no visible bulges, unnatural bends, or flattened areas that would indicate deformation. Therefore, the knees are shown as tucked tightly with natural curvature.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the bold outlines follow the contours of the figure smoothly without jagged edges or color spillage into adjacent areas?",
    "explanation": "The bold outlines around all figures in Image B—especially the main character in Steps 1 and 3—are clean and follow the contours of the bodies smoothly. The lines are consistently thick and sharp, without pixelation or jaggedness, suggesting high-resolution digital rendering. There is no evidence of color spillage (e.g., blue bleeding into white areas) or inconsistent line thickness. The outlines define the shapes clearly and enhance visibility without distorting the forms. This level of precision is typical in professionally designed instructional graphics, where clarity and aesthetic appeal are prioritized. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of graphic design standards, the outlines are well-executed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the text captions and step numbers positioned so they do not cover key facial features or limbs of the main figure?",
    "explanation": "The text elements in Image B are strategically placed to avoid obscuring critical parts of the figures. In Step 1, the text 'Positioning: Kneel with bent arms back' is located to the left of the character, leaving the face, arms, and legs fully visible. In Step 2, the instruction 'Leap Attack: Propel using core strength' is positioned to the right of the simplified figure, avoiding overlap with any body part. In Step 3, the caption 'Mid-Air Adjustment: Tuck knees tightly' is placed on the left side, while the figure sits on a stand, allowing full visibility of the face and limbs. The step numbers (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3) are also placed in corners or margins, ensuring they do not interfere with the figures. This layout demonstrates thoughtful placement to maintain clarity and readability without blocking important visual details.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Are the simplified figures in each step scaled consistently with the original character and aligned in perspective?",
    "explanation": "The simplified figures (such as the white silhouette in Step 2) are significantly smaller than the full-color character depictions in Steps 1 and 3. However, their scaling appears intentional to serve as reference guides rather than direct comparisons. The simplified figure in Step 2 is proportionally accurate relative to its own context—kneeling—and matches the general body proportions expected in a human form. Despite differences in size, the perspective is consistent: all figures are shown from a similar frontal view, maintaining alignment with the overall composition. The use of different scales is a common technique in instructional diagrams to differentiate between examples and explanations. While not perfectly scaled to the original character, the alignment and perspective remain coherent across steps, supporting clear visual communication. Thus, while not identical in scale, the figures are aligned consistently in perspective.",
    "answer": "Yes"
