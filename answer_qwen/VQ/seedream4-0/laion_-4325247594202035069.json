      "question": "Are the surfaces of all four figures covered in soft-looking fabric with consistent, non-repeating bold patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, and do they lack visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the four figures appear to be made of soft, plush-like fabric with a consistent texture resembling knitted or woven material. The color palette includes bold, non-repeating patterns in blue, green, red, and yellow, which are applied in a way that suggests intentional design rather than random coloring. The surfaces have a uniform, textile appearance without visible seams, pixelation, or artificial textures such as those seen in digital rendering artifacts. The softness is implied by the rounded edges and slight sagging in areas like limbs and weapons, typical of stuffed toys. There are no signs of digital distortion or sharp transitions that would suggest artificial textures. This conclusion is based on visual cues such as fabric-like folds, matte finish, and color blending consistent with textile manufacturing.",

      "question": "Do the legs and arms of all four figures morph into exaggerated fins and tails in a way that maintains their original dynamic poses without broken geometry or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The legs and arms of the figures in Image B have been transformed into exaggerated fin-like and tail-like structures, consistent with the aquatic theme. However, these transformations do not maintain the original dynamic poses without unnatural bends. For example, the figure in the bottom right has legs that end in fish tails but are bent at angles inconsistent with natural fish anatomy or biomechanics, appearing somewhat rigid and misaligned. Similarly, the arm of the figure in the bottom left extends into a fin that appears disconnected from the body's motion, suggesting a lack of anatomical continuity. While the overall pose remains dynamic, the morphing of limbs into fins introduces geometric distortions—such as disproportionate scaling and awkward joint angles—that break the illusion of natural movement. Therefore, despite the creative reinterpretation, the transformation does not preserve physical plausibility or smooth geometry.",

      "question": "Have the weapons of each figure been reimagined as integrated fish-like features (such as fins or tail extensions) without floating or misaligned components that break physical logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The weapons in Image B have been reimagined as fish-like features, such as fins and tail extensions. For instance, the axe held by the top-left figure is now a blue fin-shaped structure attached to its arm, and the sword in the bottom-right figure is replaced by a red, elongated fin resembling a dorsal spine. These adaptations integrate the weapons into the aquatic theme, but they do not fully adhere to physical logic. Some components, like the axe in the top-right figure, appear to float slightly above the hand without proper attachment, suggesting misalignment. Additionally, the weapon in the bottom-left figure (a red blade) seems detached from the body and lacks integration with the figure’s anatomy. These floating or misaligned elements violate principles of structural coherence and physical grounding. Thus, while creatively themed, the weapons fail to maintain logical integration with the figures’ bodies.",

      "question": "Is the background a textured sandy fabric surface with subtle shading and depth, and are all four figures positioned naturally on it without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a textured sandy surface resembling beach sand, with visible granular detail and subtle shading that creates depth. The lighting appears to come from above, casting soft shadows beneath the figures, which enhances the sense of three-dimensionality and grounding. All four figures are positioned on this surface without floating or clipping issues; their feet make contact with the sand, and there are no visual gaps or overlaps that suggest improper placement. The presence of small decorative elements like coral and pebbles further reinforces the naturalistic setting. The consistency of shadow and texture across the scene supports the conclusion that the figures are naturally placed within a cohesive environment. This analysis relies on visual cues such as shadow direction, surface texture, and spatial alignment.",

      "question": "Do the hands of each figure retain a natural number of fingers (no more than five), maintain ergonomic grip positions, and show no signs of deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the hands in Image B, none of the figures display a natural number of fingers (five). Instead, the hands are stylized as simplified, rounded appendages with no distinct digits. For example, the figure in the bottom-right holds a weapon with what appears to be a single, blunt grip, lacking individual fingers. Similarly, the other figures have hands that resemble padded paws or fins rather than human-like hands. These designs are consistent with plush toy aesthetics, where anatomical accuracy is sacrificed for cuteness and simplicity. As such, the hands do not retain ergonomic grip positions or show any signs of deformation due to the absence of fingers altogether. However, since they clearly do not have five fingers and instead feature simplified forms, they fail to meet the criterion of retaining a natural number of fingers. The reasoning here combines visual observation with expectations of biological realism in hand anatomy.",
