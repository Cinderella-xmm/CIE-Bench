      "question": "Are the crystal facets on the cabin’s walls, roof, and windows evenly shaped and aligned with the original cabin’s triangular and rectangular outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cabin is covered with crystal facets that appear to be evenly shaped and aligned. The triangular and rectangular outlines of the original cabin are preserved in the design of these facets. This conclusion is drawn by observing how the edges of the crystals follow the same geometric patterns as the cabin's structure. The visual cues suggest a deliberate transformation maintaining the original architectural lines.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces show variations in transparency and light reflection consistent with real glass or crystal, rather than uniform solid colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue and green hues on the crystal surfaces in Image B show variations in transparency and light reflection. These variations mimic real glass or crystal behavior, where light interacts differently depending on the angle and thickness of the material. The presence of highlights and shadows indicates a realistic rendering rather than uniform solid colors.",

      "question": "Are the vertical support beams and horizontal railings converted into crystal forms that maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vertical support beams and horizontal railings in Image B have been converted into crystal forms. They maintain their original spacing, height, and alignment with the cabin’s frame. This is evident from the consistent pattern and positioning of the crystal structures, which align with where the wooden elements would have been in the original image.",

      "question": "Is the white marble platform beneath the cabin flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities, and does it extend evenly under the entire base of the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white marble platform beneath the cabin in Image B appears flat, continuous, and free of cracks or irregularities. It extends evenly under the entire base of the structure, providing a stable foundation. The smooth texture and uniform color suggest a carefully designed element meant to complement the crystal cabin.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the small crystal formations along the base of the cabin proportionally smaller than the main structure, grouped in clusters, and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth rather than random placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small crystal formations along the base of the cabin in Image B are proportionally smaller than the main structure. They are grouped in clusters and positioned in a way that suggests natural growth. Their placement follows a logical pattern that enhances the aesthetic appeal while maintaining a sense of organic development.",
