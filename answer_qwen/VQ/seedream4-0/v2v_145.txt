    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the mango pieces are enlarged and have a shiny appearance. The texture seems uniform and smooth, which is not typical of natural mango flesh. The shape appears consistent with how diced mango would look, but the glossy finish suggests an artificial enhancement rather than natural lighting. This unnatural shine makes the texture appear more plastic-like than organic.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The lime in Image B has been given cartoon-like features such as eyes and a mouth, which is not visually credible for a real lime. Similarly, the chili powder bowl also has a face drawn on it, which is whimsical and unrealistic. These additions introduce unnatural artifacts that do not align with the expected appearance of these items in reality.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B includes elements like the whimsical mango figurine, lime with a face, and a chili powder bowl with a face. While these elements are arranged neatly on the plate, their cartoonish designs make them visually inconsistent with a realistic food presentation. The whimsical nature introduces a playful but structurally inconsistent aesthetic compared to a natural setting.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The shiny 3D effect on the mango pieces in Image B enhances visual appeal by making them stand out due to their reflective surfaces. However, this effect introduces an unnatural texture that deviates from the matte or slightly glossy surface typically seen on fresh mangoes. Fine details are lost in favor of a more polished, less realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The whimsical mango figurine in Image B maintains its structural integrity in terms of shape and form. It does not exhibit broken geometric shapes or unnatural distortions beyond the intentional stylization. The design remains cohesive despite its exaggerated and shiny characteristics.",
    "answer": "Yes"
