      "question": "Are the eyes and grin added to the energy blast positioned within the glowing orb and aligned with its curvature, without creating jagged edges or broken light paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the energy blast is depicted as a spherical blue orb with facial features—specifically two orange eyes and a wide grin—embedded within it. These features are drawn in a way that follows the curvature of the orb, suggesting an intentional design choice to make the face appear as if it's part of the energy sphere itself. The lines forming the eyes and mouth are smooth and curved, conforming to the spherical shape of the orb. There are no visible jagged edges or broken light paths around these features; instead, the glow and shading blend seamlessly into the facial elements. This indicates careful digital rendering where the facial details are integrated into the orb’s surface rather than being superimposed flatly. The visual coherence suggests that the artist prioritized continuity in light flow and form alignment, which supports a 'Yes' answer.",

      "question": "Is the dialogue bubble positioned so that it does not overlap with Naruto’s face or hand, and does it have clean borders and readable text?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dialogue bubble in the top panel of Image B contains the text 'You've met your match, ninja! Prepare yourself!' It is placed above Naruto’s head, slightly to the left, ensuring that it does not cover any part of his face or hand. The bubble has a clean, white fill with a black outline, typical of comic book styling, and the text inside is clearly legible. The positioning allows full visibility of Naruto’s expression and posture while maintaining readability. There is no visual obstruction between the character and the speech bubble, and the border is sharp and consistent. Therefore, based on both placement and clarity, the answer is 'Yes'.",

      "question": "Do the motion lines and energy beams from the spirit and Naruto’s attack converge smoothly at the fusion point, showing continuous flow without abrupt breaks or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the bottom panel of Image B, the energy blast (spirit) and Naruto’s chakra-infused fist meet at a central point labeled 'Ultimate Fusion Strike!'. The motion lines radiate outward from this point, indicating explosive force. The energy beams from both sources—Naruto’s arm and the spiraling orb—appear to merge at the center, with swirling light effects and particle trails that suggest a seamless fusion. While there are some sharp angular lines representing debris, the main energy flows are continuous and follow curved trajectories that align at the collision point. There are no visible gaps or misalignments in the energy streams themselves; they maintain a cohesive path toward the convergence zone. This implies a deliberate artistic effort to depict dynamic unity in the attack, supporting a 'Yes' response.",

      "question": "Are the debris and elemental fragments in the background rendered with consistent lighting and shadow, appearing to float in a shared 3D space rather than being pasted flatly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The debris in the lower panel of Image B consists of various rock fragments scattered across the scene. These pieces exhibit varying degrees of brightness and shadow, with highlights on one side and darker tones on the opposite, suggesting directional lighting consistent with the source of the explosion. Some fragments appear closer to the viewer due to size and detail, while others recede into the background, contributing to depth perception. Additionally, the particles seem to be influenced by the same force field emanating from the fusion point, giving them a sense of movement and spatial consistency. There is no evidence of flat pasting—such as uniform coloration or lack of perspective—indicating that the artist applied shading and layering techniques to simulate three-dimensional space. Thus, the debris appears integrated into a coherent 3D environment.",

      "question": "Does Naruto’s face retain the original number of whisker marks, eye shape, and headband position, with no distorted lines or missing features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In both panels of Image B, Naruto’s face is shown clearly. He has three distinct whisker marks on each cheek, which matches his canonical appearance in the *Naruto* series. His eyes are almond-shaped with orange irises and black pupils, consistent with his character design during his adult phase. The forehead protector (headband) is worn correctly across his forehead, displaying the Konoha symbol centered and upright. There are no signs of distortion, such as warped lines or missing features. Even under dynamic action poses, the proportions and key facial elements remain accurate. This adherence to established design standards confirms that the character's features are preserved faithfully.",

      "question": "Is the action bubble placed in a visible area of the image without covering Naruto’s hand or the fusion point, and does it use consistent styling with the dialogue bubble?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The action bubble in the lower panel reads 'Ultimate Fusion strike!' and is positioned to the right of the fusion point, near the armored figure’s arm. It does not obscure Naruto’s hand or the central energy interaction, allowing full visibility of the climactic moment. The bubble uses the same style as the dialogue bubble—white fill, black outline, and sans-serif font—which ensures visual consistency across the comic panel. Its placement is strategic, enhancing the dramatic impact without blocking critical visual elements. Given that both bubbles share identical formatting and are placed appropriately, the answer is 'Yes'.",
