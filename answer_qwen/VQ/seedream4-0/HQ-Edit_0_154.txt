    "Question": "Q1: Does the schematic outline of the wallet maintain accurate proportions and closed geometric shapes without jagged edges or missing lines?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wallet is depicted as a technical schematic with clean, precise lines. The outline of the wallet appears to be composed of smooth, continuous strokes forming a rectangular shape with rounded corners and a flap closure on the right side. All edges are closed, and there are no visible gaps or breaks in the lines. The proportions appear consistent with a typical bi-fold wallet, maintaining symmetry and structural integrity. The use of fine, uniform lines suggests digital precision, and there are no jagged edges or missing segments that would indicate rendering artifacts. Based on visual inspection and standard drafting principles, the schematic maintains accurate proportions and closed geometric forms.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the lines forming the wallet’s schematic structure uniformly thin, continuous, and free of smudges or inconsistent thickness that suggest texture or artifact?",
    "explanation": "The lines in the schematic representation of the wallet in Image B are consistently thin and appear to be digitally drawn with vector precision. There is no variation in line thickness across different parts of the wallet's outline, such as the main body, stitching details, or flap. The lines are continuous without any breaks, smudges, or pixelation, which would otherwise suggest low resolution or rasterization artifacts. The absence of texture or irregularities indicates a clean, high-quality vector illustration. This level of consistency aligns with professional schematic design standards where clarity and uniformity are essential.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the text annotations for “USD,” “QAR,” and “INR” placed adjacent to their respective banknote slots without overlapping the notes or distorting the wallet’s layout?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the text labels 'USD', 'QAR', and 'INR' are positioned to the left of the wallet schematic, not directly adjacent to individual banknote slots within the wallet itself. Instead, they appear in separate informational panels below the title 'Currencies of the World'. These labels are associated with corresponding icons and data bars, but they do not physically overlap with the banknotes or interfere with the wallet’s layout. While the placement is logical for an infographic, it does not place the currency codes next to their respective note positions inside the wallet. Therefore, the annotation is not spatially aligned with the banknote slots in the wallet diagram.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the exchange rate charts and country economy icons aligned horizontally or vertically in a balanced manner, with no floating or misplaced elements that disrupt visual flow?",
    "explanation": "The exchange rate chart and country economy icons in Image B are arranged in a structured layout on the right side of the image. The bar chart labeled 'Exchange Economy' is vertically aligned with its axis and bars properly spaced, showing a clear progression over time. Above it, the text annotations for QAR, Exhunmoomy, Exchange com, and INR are aligned in a vertical column, though some labels appear slightly misaligned or truncated. The icons related to USD and QAR are grouped beneath the currency labels on the left, forming a horizontal alignment. However, the overall layout shows some imbalance—particularly in the spacing between the wallet schematic and the right-side annotations, and the top-right labels seem to float without clear connection to the central wallet graphic. This creates a slight disruption in visual continuity.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the visible banknotes (USD $20, QAR 10, INR 50) retain clear denominations, readable text, and intact designs without blurring, stretching, or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the banknotes are rendered as part of a schematic outline, meaning they are stylized rather than photorealistic. The denominations such as '20' on the USD bill, '10' on the QAR note, and '50' on the INR note are visible, but due to the monochrome, line-drawing style, details like intricate patterns, serial numbers, and fine text are not clearly legible. The designs are simplified into outlines without color or texture, leading to a loss of detail. While the major denomination numbers are discernible, finer elements such as signatures, security features, or script are absent or indistinct. Additionally, because this is a schematic, the notes may appear slightly stretched or compressed to fit the artistic composition. Thus, while the basic identification of denominations is possible, the full clarity and fidelity of real-world banknote design are not preserved.",
    "answer": "No"
