    "Question": "Q1: Are the robes depicted with consistent indigo and gold patterns that follow the contours of the original drapery without visible seams or unnatural texture breaks?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the robes are illustrated in a traditional Japanese woodblock print style, reminiscent of ukiyo-e art. The fabric is rendered with flowing indigo and gold patterns that align with the folds and drapery of the garment. These patterns appear to be carefully applied along the natural curves of the fabric, following the contours of the body beneath. The gold accents, particularly on the sleeves and edges, are integrated into the design in a way that suggests continuity rather than abrupt breaks. There are no visible seams or jagged interruptions in the pattern, and the texture remains consistent across the surface of the robe. This consistency is typical of high-quality ukiyo-e prints, where pattern continuity is essential for aesthetic harmony. Given the stylized yet coherent rendering, it is reasonable to conclude that the patterns follow the drapery naturally.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the arms feature calligraphic lines that follow the natural curvature of the limbs without distorting the hands or creating more than five fingers per hand?",
    "explanation": "The arms in Image B are drawn with bold, expressive lines characteristic of traditional Japanese artistic styles. These lines resemble calligraphic strokes, especially noticeable in the outlines of the sleeves and limbs. However, upon close inspection, the hands maintain anatomical accuracy: each hand clearly has five fingers, with no extra digits or distortions. The lines defining the arms curve smoothly along the limb’s natural form, suggesting an intentional stylistic choice rather than deformation. While the style is exaggerated for dramatic effect, the number of fingers and overall hand structure remain within realistic bounds. Therefore, despite the stylization, there is no evidence of distortion or excess fingers.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the face composed of clean, continuous outlines that preserve the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth without exaggerated or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "The facial features in Image B are rendered with smooth, flowing lines typical of Japanese woodblock prints. The eyes are gently closed, forming soft, curved shapes; the nose is proportionally placed and outlined continuously; and the mouth is subtly defined with a single unbroken line. There are no jagged edges or broken strokes around the facial features, and the contours remain intact and harmonious. The style emphasizes serenity and grace, which is achieved through clean, uninterrupted outlines. Although the face is stylized, it preserves the basic human proportions and avoids exaggeration. Thus, the facial depiction adheres to the principle of continuous, well-defined lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the wave-like clouds in the background smoothly blended with the statue's silhouette, without sharp boundaries or overlapping inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B features dynamic wave patterns at the bottom, rendered in a style similar to Hokusai’s 'The Great Wave off Kanagawa'. These waves are layered and detailed, with white foam and blue crests. However, they do not seamlessly blend into the statue’s silhouette. Instead, there is a clear, sharp boundary between the lower edge of the robe and the waves, indicating a deliberate separation rather than integration. Additionally, the waves appear to be positioned behind the figure, but their placement does not overlap with the statue in a way that suggests depth or fusion—there are no visual cues of interaction such as partial obscuration or shadowing. While the composition is visually striking, the blending is not smooth; the transition is abrupt. Therefore, the waves are not smoothly merged with the statue’s form.",
    "answer": "No"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is the statue's posture stable, with arms symmetrically extended and the head centered above the torso, showing no signs of misalignment or deformation?",
    "explanation": "The posture of the figure in Image B appears balanced and symmetrical. Both arms are extended outward in a mirrored fashion, maintaining equal angles relative to the body. The head is positioned centrally above the torso, aligned with the spine, and there is no visible tilt or skew. Despite the stylized nature of the artwork, the proportions and alignment suggest intentional symmetry and stability. The figure stands upright, with no indication of leaning or distortion. In contrast to potential issues in digital edits or poor renderings, this image maintains structural coherence. The balance is preserved even within the artistic conventions of ukiyo-e, which often emphasize elegance over strict realism. Hence, the posture is stable and properly aligned.",
    "answer": "Yes"
