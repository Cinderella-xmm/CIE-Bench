    "Question": "Q1: Do the extended stripes seamlessly blend into the grass without creating unnatural textures or patterns?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the extension of the zebra's stripes onto the grass creates a surreal and visually striking effect. However, the stripes do not blend naturally with the grass; instead, they form a stark contrast that disrupts the natural texture and pattern of the grass. The sharp lines and uniformity of the stripes clash with the organic, varied appearance of the grass, resulting in an unnatural look.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2: Are the stripes extended in a way that preserves the original geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body?",
    "explanation": "The extension of the stripes in Image B appears to maintain the geometric structure and proportions of the zebra's body as seen in Image A. The stripes follow the contours and angles consistent with the zebra's form, suggesting that the artist aimed to preserve these elements while extending the design. Comparing both images, the continuity of the stripe pattern from the zebra's body to the surrounding area seems intentional and proportionate.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3: Does the edited image maintain a visually credible composition where the zebra remains the focal point without being overshadowed by the surreal extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra is still clearly visible and serves as the central subject of the image. However, the surreal extension of its stripes into the surrounding environment draws significant attention, potentially overshadowing the zebra itself. While the zebra remains a focal point due to its distinct features and positioning, the artistic extension competes for visual dominance, challenging the overall credibility of the composition.",
    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4: Are key features of the zebra such as its mane, ears, and legs still clearly visible and natural looking amidst the surreal extension of its stripes?",
    "explanation": "Despite the surreal extension of the stripes, key features of the zebra like its mane, ears, and legs remain clearly visible in Image B. These features retain their natural shape and position relative to the zebra's body, which suggests that the editing process was careful not to distort these important characteristics. Comparing with Image A, these features appear consistent and natural, even within the context of the artistic alteration.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5: Have the fine details of the zebra's stripes and the grass been preserved without noticeable degradation or introduction of artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the fine details of the zebra's stripes appear well-preserved, maintaining clarity and definition. Similarly, the grass retains its texture and detail, with no obvious signs of degradation or artifacts introduced by the editing process. The transition between the zebra's stripes and the grass, although surreal, does not seem to compromise the quality of either element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
