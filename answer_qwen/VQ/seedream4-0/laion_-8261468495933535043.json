      "question": "Do the tessellated tiles forming the sausages maintain the original elongated, curved shape without geometric distortion or unnatural straightening?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sausages are represented by tessellated tiles that form an elongated and curved shape. The tiles follow a pattern that suggests curvature without appearing unnaturally straightened or geometrically distorted. This conclusion is drawn from observing the alignment of the tiles which maintain a smooth flow resembling the original sausage shape.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the green-tiled areas shaped to mimic the natural ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves, with no uniform or blocky alignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green-tiled areas in Image B are arranged to mimic the ruffled edges and layered structure of lettuce leaves. The tiles are not uniformly aligned but rather placed in a way that creates a natural, organic appearance similar to leaf edges. This analysis is based on the irregularity and variation in tile placement, which reflects the complexity of real lettuce leaves.",

      "question": "Is the egg-shaped tile formation perfectly circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section, matching the original egg’s proportions and orientation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The egg-shaped tile formation in Image B is circular with a centrally placed orange-yellow yolk section. The proportions appear consistent with the original egg's shape and orientation. The white tiles forming the egg white surround the yellow tiles representing the yolk, maintaining the expected symmetry and proportionality.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mosaic elements positioned symmetrically around the plate’s center, with equal spacing and proportional sizing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mosaic elements in Image B are positioned around the plate’s center with a balanced arrangement. The spacing between the sausage, salad, and egg sections appears proportional and symmetrical, suggesting careful placement to achieve visual harmony. Comparing this with Image A, where the food items are similarly spaced, reinforces the conclusion of symmetry and proportionality in the mosaic representation.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do all glass tiles exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading without visible artifacts like blurring or jagged lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All glass tiles in Image B exhibit uniform edge definition, subtle reflection effects, and consistent color shading. There are no visible artifacts such as blurring or jagged lines, indicating high-quality craftsmanship in the mosaic design. The uniformity and clarity of each tile contribute to a polished and cohesive appearance.",
