      "question": "Are the facial wrinkles and skin texture on the elderâ€™s face naturally rendered without excessive smoothing or artificial cartoon-like distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the elder's facial features exhibit a stylized and smooth appearance with simplified lines and exaggerated proportions typical of animated characters. The wrinkles are less pronounced and more uniform, lacking the natural irregularities and depth seen in real human skin. This suggests an intentional artistic choice to create a cartoon-like effect rather than a realistic depiction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the hanbok in Image B appear vibrant and detailed, with each flower distinctly separated from others. The surrounding foliage also shows clear details without any noticeable blurring. There is no evidence of pattern repetition that would suggest a lack of unique design elements. The consistency in detail across both the hanbok and foliage indicates careful rendering.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hanbok in Image B displays a smooth gradient transition with colors blending seamlessly into one another.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green vines in Image B are positioned around the edges of the frame, giving the impression that they are part of the background.
