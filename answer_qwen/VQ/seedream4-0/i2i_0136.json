      "question": "Does the orange retain a realistic glossy texture without unnatural or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the orange has a glossy texture that appears smooth and reflective. The reflections on its surface are consistent with how light interacts with a polished, non-porous material like plastic or rubber rather than a natural orange peel. There are no visible pixelated artifacts or distortions in the texture, which suggests a high-quality rendering. The visual cues align with a realistic representation of a glossy object.",

      "question": "Is the stem of the orange well-integrated into the rubber keychain design, maintaining a natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stem of the orange in Image B is green and appears to be made of the same material as the rest of the keychain. It is well-integrated into the design, maintaining a natural appearance relative to the context of a rubber keychain. The stem's color and shape are consistent with what one might expect from a stylized representation of an orange's stem, contributing to the overall realism within the context of the keychain design.",

      "question": "Do the proportions and shape of the keychain maintain a believable keychain structure, avoiding any distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions and shape of the keychain in Image B are consistent with typical keychain designs. The spherical shape mimics that of an orange while being slightly simplified for practicality. The geometry is not distorted; it maintains a believable structure that one would expect from a functional and decorative keychain. The visual coherence supports the idea that this is a plausible keychain.",

      "question": "Does the color of the orange keychain accurately reflect a citrus hue, contributing to the authenticity and visual credibility of the object?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color of the orange keychain in Image B accurately reflects a citrus hue. The orange color is vibrant and consistent with the natural coloration of oranges, which enhances the authenticity and visual credibility of the object. The color choice contributes to the perception that this is indeed a representation of an orange, albeit in a keychain form.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transition between the rubber keychain material and the orange's surface seamless, contributing to overall visual coherence and plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the rubber keychain material and the orange's surface in Image B is seamless. The uniformity in texture and color across the entire object suggests that it is designed to look like a single cohesive item. This seamless integration contributes to the overall visual coherence and plausibility of the keychain as a stylized orange.",
