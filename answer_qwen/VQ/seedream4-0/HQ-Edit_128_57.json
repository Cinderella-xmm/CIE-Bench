      "question": "Does the desk exhibit continuous, realistic embossed wood textures across its surface without visible seams, irregularities, or artificial-looking patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the desk appears to have a continuous wood texture that is consistent with embossed wood finishes. There are no visible seams or irregularities that would suggest artificial patterns. The texture looks natural and uniform across the surface, which aligns with common characteristics of high-quality wooden furniture. This conclusion is drawn from observing the smooth flow of the grain and lack of abrupt changes in texture.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the writing pad positioned flatly on the desk with uniform edges and natural aging effects such as slight discoloration and texture variation, without warped or broken geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The writing pad in Image B is positioned flatly on the desk with edges that appear uniform. The paper shows slight discoloration and texture variation, which are typical signs of natural aging. There are no warped or broken geometries visible; the pad maintains a realistic appearance. This analysis is based on the visual cues of the paper's texture and color variations, which are consistent with aged materials.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the quill-shaped logo rendered with a raised, metallic gold finish that shows subtle highlights and shadows consistent with embossed foil, without smearing or unnatural sheen?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The quill-shaped logo in Image B has a metallic gold finish with subtle highlights and shadows that suggest it is embossed. The lighting creates a realistic effect of raised foil, without any smearing or unnatural sheen. The details in the logo are sharp and consistent with what one would expect from a metallic object under similar lighting conditions. This conclusion is reached by examining the interplay of light and shadow on the logo's surface.",

      "question": "Is the ink bottle placed stably on the desk surface with proportional size and shape consistent with real glass bottles, and does the spine of the pad show clear, readable etched text without blurring or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ink bottle in Image B is placed stably on the desk, with a size and shape consistent with real glass bottles. The spine of the pad shows clear, readable etched text without any blurring or ghosting. These observations are made by assessing the proportions and clarity of the objects in relation to their surroundings, ensuring they match expected physical properties and appearances.",

      "question": "Are all modified elements (desk, pad, quill logo, ink bottle) proportionally aligned and spatially coherent, forming a unified vintage stationery package layout without floating or misaligned components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All modified elements in Image B—the desk, pad, quill logo, and ink bottle—are proportionally aligned and spatially coherent. They form a unified vintage stationery package layout without any floating or misaligned components. This coherence is evident from the harmonious arrangement and alignment of all items, contributing to an aesthetically pleasing and realistic composition.",
