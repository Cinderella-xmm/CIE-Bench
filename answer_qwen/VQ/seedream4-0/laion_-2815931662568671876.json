      "question": "Does the monocle added to the tortilla chip maintain a consistent size and shape relative to the chip, and is it seamlessly integrated without visible artifacts or unnatural shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The monocle on the tortilla chip appears to be proportionally sized and shaped relative to the chip. It is a small, round object that fits naturally on the chip's surface. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural shading around the monocle, suggesting it has been seamlessly integrated into the image. The visual cues such as the smooth texture of the chip and the realistic shadowing around the monocle support this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound proportionally sized and shaped like a realistic hand, with no more than five fingers and natural joint lines, and does it appear to emerge naturally from the guacamole without breaking its texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand-like appendage attached to the guacamole mound is not realistically sized or shaped like a human hand. It appears more stylized with exaggerated features and lacks natural joint lines. Additionally, it does not emerge naturally from the guacamole; instead, it looks like an artificial addition that disrupts the texture of the guacamole. This analysis is based on the visual cues of the hand's appearance and its interaction with the guacamole.",

      "question": "Is the spice rack positioned behind the tortilla chip in a way that respects perspective and shadow direction, and does it blend naturally with the existing background without visible seams or color mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spice rack behind the tortilla chip respects perspective and shadow direction. It appears to be positioned at a reasonable distance and angle relative to the chip, and the shadows cast by the jars seem consistent with the light source in the scene. The spice rack blends naturally with the background, with no visible seams or color mismatches, indicating careful integration into the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the mini flag banners aligned horizontally and evenly spaced above the table, and do they cast subtle shadows consistent with the light source, without appearing flat or digitally pasted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mini flag banners above the table are aligned horizontally and evenly spaced. They cast subtle shadows that are consistent with the light source in the scene, which suggests they have been integrated well into the image. There are no signs of them appearing flat or digitally pasted, as their shadows and positioning look natural within the context of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole been adjusted to pastel shades without losing their inherent textures or becoming unnaturally pale or washed out, maintaining visual credibility as edible items?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors of the tortilla chip and guacamole do not appear to have been adjusted to pastel shades. The tortilla chip retains its golden-brown hue, and the guacamole maintains its vibrant green color. Both items still look visually credible as edible items, with their inherent textures preserved. This conclusion is drawn from observing the natural coloration and texture of the food items in the image.",
