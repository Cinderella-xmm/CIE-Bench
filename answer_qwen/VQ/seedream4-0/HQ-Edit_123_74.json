      "question": "Is the helmet proportionally enlarged but still maintaining a coherent shape and realistic placement on the head without visible deformation or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the helmet appears to be rendered in a stylized, paper-cut art form consistent with the overall aesthetic of the image. The helmet maintains its structural integrity as a protective gear piece—its shape is geometrically coherent, with defined vents and contours that align with typical snowboarding helmets. Although the style is abstracted due to the layered paper effect, there is no visible distortion or unnatural edge around the helmet. It sits properly on the head, following the natural curvature of the skull and not appearing disproportionately large or misaligned. While the proportions are slightly exaggerated for artistic effect (common in papercraft illustrations), they remain within acceptable limits for stylistic representation. Therefore, despite the stylization, the helmet retains a coherent and realistic placement.",

      "question": "Do the hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no signs of distortion, stretching, or additional digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands are depicted in a stylized, low-poly papercraft manner. Each hand shows five distinct segments representing fingers, which aligns with human anatomy. However, due to the angular, faceted design of the artwork, the joints appear simplified and less anatomically precise than in real life. There are no extra digits or obvious distortions such as merging fingers or elongated limbs. The gloves are also stylized, but the underlying finger count is preserved. While the articulation isn't photorealistic, the number of fingers per hand remains correct and consistent with normal human anatomy. The slight abstraction does not introduce errors in digit count or severe distortion.",

      "question": "Are the red tones on the snowsuit vivid but still consistent with fabric texture, without appearing overly glossy, pixelated, or disconnected from the underlying material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red tones on the snowsuit in Image B are vibrant and visually striking, fitting the high-contrast, graphic nature of the papercraft style. However, the surface lacks fine textile detail such as weave patterns or subtle shading that would suggest actual fabric texture. Instead, the suit is composed of flat, polygonal planes with sharp edges, characteristic of cut-paper art. This gives it a clean, illustrative appearance rather than a realistic one. There is no glossiness or pixelation present; instead, the colors are solid and uniform across facets. While not mimicking real fabric texture, the rendering stays consistent with the artistic medium and does not appear disjointed or unnaturally separated from the form. Thus, while not realistic, the red tones are coherent within the stylized context.",

      "question": "Are the snow and tree outlines cleanly separated into layered shapes resembling paper cuts, without gaps, overlapping distortions, or floating fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B is clearly designed in a layered papercraft style, where elements like snow, trees, mountains, and the snowboarder are constructed from multiple cut-out layers. The snow and tree outlines are sharply defined, with clean edges and clear separations between layers. There are no visible gaps between adjacent layers, nor are there floating fragments or misplaced overlaps. The depth is created through careful layering, with shadows and spacing suggesting dimensionality. Even complex areas like the pine branches and snowdrifts maintain consistent layering without visual inconsistencies. The entire composition adheres closely to the principles of paper art, where precision in cutting and stacking is essential. Therefore, the outlines are well-executed and free from technical flaws typical of poorly rendered layered designs.",

      "question": "Is the snowboarder's body posture aligned with the direction of the snowboard, showing balanced weight distribution and no floating limbs or impossible angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snowboarder’s posture is dynamic and angled forward, consistent with an active snowboarding stance. Her knees are bent, her torso leans slightly forward over the board, and her arms are positioned naturally for balance—these are all indicators of proper weight distribution during descent. The snowboard is oriented diagonally across the slope, and her body follows this direction, maintaining alignment. There are no floating limbs or anatomically impossible angles; both legs are firmly attached to the boots, which are secured to the snowboard. The pose reflects a realistic snowboarding motion, even though it is stylized. The papercraft technique simplifies forms but preserves functional biomechanics. Thus, the posture remains physically plausible within the constraints of the artistic style.",
