      "question": "Does the snow on the ground appear natural and consistent with the rest of the scene, without any obvious artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the snow on the ground is depicted with soft, irregular mounds and patches that mimic natural snow accumulation. The texture appears to be layered with subtle shading, suggesting depth and volume, which aligns with real-world snow behavior. There are no sharp edges or unnatural patterns that would indicate digital artifacts. The snow blends well with the sidewalk and grassy areas, maintaining a coherent visual flow. Additionally, small tufts of grass peeking through the snow suggest partial coverage, which is typical in early winter conditions. This consistency supports the impression of a natural snow scene without visible distortions.",

      "question": "Are the falling snowflakes integrated naturally into the scene, maintaining the overall authenticity and without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The falling snowflakes in Image B are scattered across the sky and foreground in varying sizes and opacities, creating a sense of depth and motion. They are not uniformly distributed but rather follow a pattern that suggests random precipitation, which is consistent with how snow typically falls. The snowflakes are translucent and lightly rendered, avoiding harsh outlines that might make them look artificial. Their placement does not interfere with key elements like the radish character or dog, and they interact subtly with the environment—such as resting lightly on the hat and scarf—enhancing realism. This integration maintains the scene's authenticity without disrupting the composition.",

      "question": "Do the scarf and hat on the radish character fit naturally with its design, avoiding any unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The radish character in Image B wears a knitted hat and a plaid scarf, both of which are proportionally appropriate for its size and shape. The hat sits snugly over the top of the radish, with a slight fold at the brim that mimics realistic fabric draping. The scarf wraps around the neck area and hangs down symmetrically, showing folds and texture that suggest woven material. These details are consistent with common depictions of winter accessories in illustrated media. The colors (soft pink and beige tones) complement the character’s original design without clashing. There are no visible distortions in the fabric lines or unnatural stretching, indicating careful attention to form and texture.",

      "question": "Does the winter jacket on the dog fit well and look appropriate, without introducing any distortions or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is wearing a brown puffer-style winter jacket with visible stitching and a white fur-lined collar. The jacket fits snugly around the dog’s body, following its contours without appearing oversized or misshapen. The seams and zippers are drawn with care, suggesting realistic garment construction. The texture of the jacket includes subtle shading to imply padded insulation, which is typical of such outerwear. Snowflakes are lightly dusted on the jacket, reinforcing its integration into the snowy environment. There are no signs of warping or textural inconsistency, and the jacket enhances the dog’s appearance without compromising anatomical accuracy.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the proportions and physical rationality of the elements been maintained, avoiding any geometric distortions or loss of fine details after adding the winter elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "After adding winter attire to both the radish character and the dog, the overall proportions remain consistent with their original forms. The radish’s body retains its cylindrical shape, and the added hat and scarf do not alter its core structure. Similarly, the dog’s limbs and torso maintain their natural proportions under the jacket. The leash remains taut and properly connected, preserving spatial logic. Fine details such as facial expressions, leaf textures on the radish, and fur patterns on the dog are still visible and intact. No parts of the characters appear stretched, compressed, or misaligned due to the new clothing. The editing process has preserved physical rationality and visual coherence.",
