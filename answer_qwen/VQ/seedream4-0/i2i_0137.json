      "question": "Does the teapot appear naturally integrated into the scene, maintaining texture and lighting similar to the surrounding objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teapot appears to have a texture and lighting that is consistent with the surrounding objects. The light source from the window illuminates the scene evenly, and the teapot reflects this light in a way that matches the other objects on the table. The shadows cast by the teapot also align with the direction of the light, suggesting it is naturally integrated into the scene.",
