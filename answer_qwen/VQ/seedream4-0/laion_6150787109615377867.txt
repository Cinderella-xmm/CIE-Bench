    "Question": "Q1: Does the gear surface on the tabletop show consistent metallic sheen and detailed engravings without blurred or jagged edges?",
    "explanation": "The tabletop in Image B features a circular, gear-like design with intricate engravings and a highly reflective metallic surface. The visual cues indicate a polished, silver-colored metal with fine details such as ornamental patterns and gear teeth that are sharply defined. There is no visible blurring or jaggedness along the edges of the engravings or gear teeth, suggesting high-resolution rendering and precise craftsmanship. The lighting enhances the metallic sheen uniformly across the surface, reinforcing the impression of a clean, well-finished texture. Based on these observations and common knowledge of high-quality mechanical designs, the surface appears to be rendered with precision and clarity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the piston-driven limbs symmetrically arranged and proportionally scaled to the central column, with clearly defined joints and no bent or broken segments?",
    "explanation": "The two piston-driven limbs extending from the central column are positioned on opposite sides, creating a balanced, symmetrical layout. Each limb consists of multiple articulated segments connected by joints, resembling mechanical arms. The proportions of the limbs relative to the central column appear harmonious, with each segment decreasing in diameter toward the ends, which is typical of structural engineering for balance and stability. The joints are clearly defined, featuring bolts, hinges, and coiled springs, all of which are intact and properly aligned. There are no visible signs of bending, breakage, or misalignment. This symmetry and structural integrity suggest careful design, consistent with steampunk aesthetics and functional mechanical systems.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the steam vents evenly spaced along the central column and properly embedded into the metal surface without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "The central column of the structure features several vertical slits and small protruding nozzles from which steam is visibly emanating. These vents are not evenly spaced—some are clustered near the top, while others are spaced further apart lower down. However, they are all integrated into the metal surface with no visible gaps or detachment. The vents appear flush with the column’s surface, and their placement follows a deliberate design pattern rather than strict uniformity. Given the artistic nature of the steampunk style, slight irregularities in spacing are acceptable and even expected. Therefore, while not perfectly even, the vents are properly embedded and do not appear misaligned or detached.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the cog patterns and dials on the base have intact geometric shapes with uniform spacing and no overlapping or incomplete features?",
    "explanation": "The base of the structure is adorned with numerous interlocking gears and two circular dials resembling clocks. The cogs exhibit clear, sharp teeth and consistent geometric forms, with uniform spacing between adjacent gears. There is no overlap or distortion in their arrangement; each gear fits precisely within the overall design. The two dials at the center are also intact, with legible markings and hands, and they are embedded within a larger gear structure without any apparent misalignment. The overall composition suggests meticulous attention to detail, typical of steampunk-inspired mechanical art. No incomplete or fragmented elements are visible, indicating a complete and coherent design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the brass and copper accents clearly differentiated from the silver metal by color and reflectivity, without unnatural gradients or texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The image displays a combination of materials: silver (likely steel or chrome), brass, and copper. The brass components, such as the joints and fittings, have a warm golden-yellow hue with moderate reflectivity, distinct from the cooler, brighter shine of the silver parts. Copper elements, particularly in the limbs and central column, exhibit a reddish-brown tone with a slightly matte finish compared to the more polished silver. These differences in color and reflectivity are consistent with real-world material properties. There are no abrupt or unnatural gradients, nor are there pixelation or texture artifacts that would suggest poor rendering. The transitions between materials are smooth and realistic, supporting the conclusion that the materials are well-differentiated and visually accurate.",
    "answer": "Yes"
