      "question": "Is the Eiffel Tower’s structure preserved with accurate proportions and no geometric distortions despite being scaled down?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the Eiffel Tower is depicted within a glass dome as part of a snow globe-like diorama. The tower appears significantly smaller than its real-world scale but maintains its iconic lattice structure and architectural details. By examining the proportions of the base, middle section, and top spire, they appear consistent with the actual design of the Eiffel Tower. There are no visible stretching, compression, or angular distortions that would suggest digital manipulation or scaling errors. The perspective is slightly foreshortened due to the curvature of the glass dome, but this does not constitute a geometric distortion of the tower itself—rather, it's an optical effect from viewing through curved glass. Given that the tower retains its recognizable shape and structural integrity, even at reduced scale, the proportions are preserved accurately.",

      "question": "Is there a clear, seamless glass dome structure above the scene that fully encloses it without intersecting or distorting any elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a transparent glass dome enclosing the entire snowy Parisian scene, including the Eiffel Tower, trees, lampposts, and figures. The dome is smooth, rounded, and appears to be made of high-quality glass with a slight reflection and refraction effect visible on its surface. It fully covers the scene, resting on an ornate metallic base. The curvature of the dome introduces subtle visual warping, especially near the edges, which is typical when viewing objects through convex glass. However, the dome does not intersect with any internal elements—it floats above them, maintaining spatial separation. While the glass causes some light refraction and minor distortion (e.g., bending of vertical lines), these effects are consistent with real-world physics of transparent domes and do not indicate a flaw in the enclosure. Therefore, the dome is seamlessly integrated and functionally complete.",

      "question": "Does the snow cover on the ground, trees, and lampposts appear uniformly powdery and free of clumping or artificial texture patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow in Image B is rendered with fine detail across all surfaces. On the ground, it appears soft and evenly distributed, with gentle undulations suggesting natural accumulation. The snow on tree branches and lampposts is lightly dusted, forming delicate flakes rather than thick clumps. There is no evidence of unnatural repetition or pixelation that might indicate artificial texturing. The snowflakes visible inside the dome also appear individually distinct, enhancing realism. The consistency of the snow layer across different materials—metal, stone, wood—suggests careful attention to material interaction. No areas show excessive smoothing or clumping, such as those seen in low-resolution digital art. Overall, the snow looks naturally powdery and realistic, avoiding artificial patterns.",

      "question": "Are all human figures proportionally small, anatomically correct (including hands with no more than five fingers), and posed in natural stances without deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The human figures in Image B are miniature versions of people walking or standing along the path. They are proportionally small relative to the environment, fitting the scale of a diorama. Each figure has a clearly defined body shape with limbs and heads in correct anatomical alignment. Upon close inspection, the hands of the figures are visible in some cases (e.g., one person holding a camera), and they appear to have five fingers each, consistent with human anatomy. Their postures—walking, sitting, taking photos—are natural and plausible. There is no visible elongation, twisting, or merging of limbs that would suggest deformation. While their details are simplified due to scale, they remain anatomically coherent and realistically posed for the context of a winter scene.",

      "question": "Do the streetlamps emit a faint, diffused glow without bright halos or overexposed areas, and are they aligned along the pathway as in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the streetlamps line both sides of the central pathway leading toward the Eiffel Tower. They are evenly spaced and follow a straight alignment, consistent with urban planning aesthetics. Each lamp emits a warm, golden glow that softly illuminates the surrounding snow and nearby trees. The light appears diffused, with no harsh halos or blown-out highlights, indicating controlled lighting typical of a carefully lit diorama. This contrasts with potential overexposure in poorly rendered images. The glow enhances the cozy, wintry atmosphere without overwhelming the scene. The alignment matches the symmetry observed in many representations of Parisian boulevards, reinforcing realism. Thus, both the lighting quality and placement are accurate.",

      "question": "Are cobblestone textures visibly embedded beneath the snow along the pathways, showing consistent patterns and fine detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central pathway in Image B features a section where the snow is thinner or partially cleared, revealing underlying cobblestones. These stones are arranged in a regular, interlocking pattern typical of European city streets. The individual stones are distinguishable, with variations in size and shape that add realism. The texture is sharp and consistent, not blurred or repetitive. Snow rests lightly on top of them, creating depth and contrast. This level of detail suggests intentional rendering to mimic real cobblestone paths. The visibility and clarity of the pattern confirm that the texture is not just implied but explicitly present and well-defined.",

      "question": "Are the tree branches thin, naturally branched, and lightly dusted with snow without sagging or unnatural accumulation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The trees in Image B are bare, winter deciduous types with slender, branching structures. Their branches are thin and taper appropriately, splitting into smaller twigs in a natural fractal pattern. Snow is delicately settled on the branches, appearing as light dustings rather than heavy loads that would cause sagging. There is no visible bending or drooping under weight, which would be physically implausible for such thin branches unless heavily laden. The snow distribution is sparse and uniform, suggesting recent light snowfall rather than prolonged accumulation. This aligns with realistic winter conditions in a controlled environment like a snow globe. The overall appearance is lifelike and avoids exaggerated or artificial snow buildup.",
