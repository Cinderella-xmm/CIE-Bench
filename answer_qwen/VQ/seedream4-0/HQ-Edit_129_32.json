      "question": "Does the velvet lining inside the box display a soft, matte texture with subtle pile variation and appropriate shadowing beneath the key, indicating realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the interior of the box is lined with a dark blue velvet material. Velvet is known for its soft, matte surface and slight pile texture that creates a plush appearance. Observing the image, the velvet exhibits a consistent, non-reflective surface with gentle variations in tone that suggest the natural nap of the fabric. There are soft shadows cast beneath the key, particularly along the edges where the key contacts the lining, which indicates proper depth and interaction between the object and the fabric. These shadows are not harsh or overly defined, which aligns with how light interacts with soft materials like velvet. The subtle gradations in color and texture imply a realistic rendering of the fabric’s physical properties. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of textile behavior under lighting, the velvet appears to be accurately represented.",

      "question": "Are the gold scrollwork patterns on the lid continuous, symmetrical, and proportionally similar to the decorative elements on the key’s bow, without any jagged edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold scrollwork on the lid of the box in Image B is intricately designed and matches the ornate style of the key’s bow. Upon close inspection, the pattern features flowing curves, loops, and bead-like accents that mirror the design of the key’s upper section. The symmetry is evident: both left and right sides of the scrollwork are mirrored, suggesting careful craftsmanship. The lines are smooth and continuous, with no visible breaks, jagged edges, or pixelation. Additionally, the proportions of the scrollwork—such as the size of the loops and spacing of the beads—are consistent with those seen on the key’s bow. This suggests a deliberate design choice to create visual harmony between the key and its container. Given these observations and the common practice of matching decorative motifs in luxury items, the scrollwork appears well-executed and faithful to the key’s aesthetic.",

      "question": "Is the satin compartment visibly smooth with soft highlights and gentle folds, and does the key sit flush within it without gaps or floating above the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The satin lining inside the box in Image B displays a smooth, lustrous surface typical of satin fabric. It has soft highlights along the curved areas, especially near the edges of the compartment, which reflect light naturally due to the fabric’s sheen. There are gentle folds and creases that appear organic and consistent with how satin drapes in a confined space. The key rests within the compartment, and its base makes contact with the fabric across its entire length. There are no visible gaps or floating effects; instead, the key casts a soft shadow that confirms its placement on the surface. The slight indentation beneath the key further supports the idea that it sits flush. These visual cues align with real-world expectations of how a rigid object would interact with a soft, padded surface like satin. Thus, the rendering of the satin and the key’s positioning appear physically accurate.",

      "question": "Is the embossed text “Eternal Elegance” clearly legible, evenly raised, and rendered with a metallic luster that matches the gold tone and reflectivity of the key and scrollwork?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Eternal Elegance' is located on the lower front edge of the box in Image B. It is embossed in a cursive font with a golden hue. The lettering is clear and readable, with even spacing and consistent stroke thickness. The raised nature of the text is indicated by subtle shadows and highlights along the edges of each character, suggesting a three-dimensional effect. The metallic finish of the text matches the reflective quality of the gold key and the scrollwork on the lid, exhibiting similar light reflections and tonal warmth. This consistency in material appearance reinforces the idea that the text is part of the same luxurious design language. Given that embossing typically produces uniform elevation and that the visual rendering shows no distortion or unevenness, the text appears professionally executed and visually coherent with the rest of the object.",

      "question": "Are all ornamental details of the key — including the bow’s loops, bead-like protrusions, and shaft ridges — fully preserved and sharply defined without blurring, warping, or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the key is displayed with high clarity and detail. The bow features intricate loops and bead-like elements that are sharp and well-defined, with no signs of blurring or distortion. Each curve and protrusion maintains consistent thickness and form, indicating precise rendering. The shaft of the key includes textured ridges that are uniformly spaced and clearly visible, contributing to the sense of realism. The bite (the working end) also shows clean edges and geometric precision. There is no evidence of pixelation or warping, even upon close inspection. The level of detail is consistent with high-resolution digital photography or professional 3D rendering. Combined with world knowledge about the craftsmanship of ornamental keys, the visual fidelity suggests that all decorative elements have been faithfully preserved.",
