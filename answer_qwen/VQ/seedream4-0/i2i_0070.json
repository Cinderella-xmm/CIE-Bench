      "question": "Does the African savanna at night blend seamlessly with the existing train and tracks, without any unnatural edges or contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is positioned on railway tracks that run through an African savanna landscape under a starry night sky. The transition between the train, tracks, and surrounding environment appears smooth in terms of color grading and lighting. The reddish-brown earth of the savanna matches the gravel bed of the railway, and there are no visible jagged edges or abrupt transitions around the train or tracks. The grasses and sparse trees appear to naturally extend alongside the rails, suggesting careful compositing. However, the contrast between the dark, textured ground near the tracks and the lighter, more uniform savanna beyond could be slightly artificial. Yet, overall, the integration is quite seamless, especially considering the dramatic change in setting from a green, tree-lined railway (as seen in Image A) to a dry, open savanna. This suggests that the editor has used masking and blending techniques effectively to maintain visual continuity.",

      "question": "Are the stars and the Milky Way depicted naturally, without any artificial or pixelated textures disrupting their appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The night sky in Image B features a vivid depiction of the Milky Way and numerous stars. The gradient of the galaxy—from dense clusters to fainter regions—matches known astronomical visuals. The stars are rendered with varying brightness and size, simulating depth, which is consistent with long-exposure astrophotography. There are no obvious pixelation artifacts, halos, or repeating patterns that would suggest low-resolution overlay or digital noise. The distribution of stars appears random and natural, not arranged in grids or overly symmetric patterns. While some artistic enhancement may have been applied for aesthetic appeal, the overall texture and detail of the celestial elements are convincing and free from artificial distortions. Therefore, the stars and Milky Way appear to be rendered with high fidelity.",

      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the train and tracks correspond logically to the new nighttime savanna setting, maintaining structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the train is illuminated by ambient light that seems to come from the direction of the viewer, casting soft shadows behind it onto the tracks and ground. This lighting direction is consistent with moonlight or faint ambient glow from the night sky, which aligns with the scene's nocturnal setting. The shadows are subtle but present, showing depth and form, particularly under the front of the locomotive and along the sides. The track ballast and surrounding terrain also show gentle shading, indicating a diffuse light source typical of a starlit night. In contrast, Image A shows daylight conditions with stronger directional sunlight and sharper shadows. The shift to softer, more even illumination in Image B is appropriate for nighttime. However, the lack of strong highlights or reflections on the train’s surface might make it appear slightly flat, but this is plausible given the low-light environment. Overall, the lighting and shadows are logically consistent with the new setting.",

      "question": "Is the size of the train relative to the vastness of the African savanna and the starry sky proportionally correct and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The train in Image B is centered on the tracks, with the surrounding savanna stretching into the distance. The scale of the train appears consistent with real-world proportions: it is large enough to dominate the foreground but small compared to the expansive horizon and sky. The distant acacia trees and flat terrain help establish depth, reinforcing the sense of vastness. The Milky Way spans the entire sky, which is realistic in terms of perspective. The train does not appear disproportionately large or small; its silhouette fits naturally within the landscape. Comparing with Image A, where the train is shown in a more confined railway yard with nearby trees and signals, the open space in Image B enhances the feeling of isolation and scale. The proportional relationship between the train and its environment is well-balanced and believable.",

      "question": "Have the fine details of the train been preserved without degradation or introduction of unnatural textures during the editing process?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the train in Image B, the details such as the number plate 'BB 301 17', the logo, the headlights, and the weathered paintwork remain sharp and clear. The surface texture of the locomotive, including minor scratches and panel lines, is visible and consistent with the original image (Image A). There are no signs of blurring, pixelation, or artificial smoothing that would indicate loss of resolution during editing. The red bumper, blue stripe, and white body retain their distinct colors and clarity. Additionally, the reflections and slight wear on the glass windows appear natural. The editing process seems to have maintained the integrity of the train’s fine details while integrating it into a new environment, suggesting high-quality compositing and upscaling if necessary.",
