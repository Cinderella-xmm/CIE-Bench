    "Question": "Q1: Does the entire surface of the LEGO statue display uniform brick textures with no visible patches of residual wood grain or inconsistent material transitions?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the statue is clearly constructed from LEGO bricks, as evidenced by the blocky, modular structure and the distinct interlocking patterns typical of LEGO construction. The surface texture is consistent across the entire figure, composed of uniformly sized rectangular elements in various shades of brown and tan. There are no visual indications of wood grain or any other material inconsistencies—such as patches, seams, or irregularities that would suggest a composite material. The texture appears entirely synthetic and artificial, matching the expected appearance of LEGO bricks. Given that LEGO bricks are made of plastic and have a uniform surface finish, the absence of wood grain or mixed materials is expected and accurate. Therefore, based on visual analysis and world knowledge about LEGO construction, the surface is uniformly textured.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the detailed carvings on the headdress, chest plate, and belt represented by small, precisely placed LEGO bricks that preserve the original patterns without loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "The headdress, chest plate, and belt of the LEGO statue in Image B feature intricate designs that closely mimic those seen in traditional carved wooden figures. However, due to the inherent limitations of LEGO construction—where each element is a discrete block—the level of detail must be approximated rather than perfectly replicated. While the overall patterns (such as geometric shapes, symmetrical motifs, and central emblems) are preserved through careful placement of smaller LEGO bricks, some fine details from the original carving may be simplified or lost at the micro-level. For instance, delicate curves or fine lines in the original design may appear angular or blurred when translated into LEGO form. Nonetheless, the craftsmanship suggests an effort to maintain fidelity, using varied brick sizes and colors to simulate depth and complexity. Thus, while the general design intent is preserved, there is some inevitable loss of fine detail due to the medium’s constraints.",

    "Question": "Q3: Do the arms, legs, and torso of the LEGO statue maintain natural human proportions with correctly scaled joints and limbs?",
    "explanation": "Upon examining the LEGO statue in Image B, the proportions of the arms, legs, and torso appear stylized rather than anatomically accurate. The limbs are elongated and segmented in a way that reflects LEGO's modular design—each joint (e.g., elbows, knees) is formed by distinct brick segments, which can result in exaggerated angles or unnatural bends. The torso is broad and boxy, consistent with LEGO’s aesthetic, but not proportionate to a real human body. Additionally, the head is disproportionately large compared to the body, a common trait in LEGO figures for stylistic and structural reasons. These features indicate that while the statue captures the general silhouette of a human-like figure, it does not adhere to natural human proportions. Instead, it follows the conventions of LEGO modeling, where functionality and visual recognition take precedence over realism.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Do both hands of the LEGO statue have five distinct fingers with natural finger positioning and no signs of merging or deformation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the LEGO statue are constructed using LEGO bricks, which limits the ability to replicate fine anatomical details. Each hand appears to have five separate digits, but they are not individually articulated or shaped like natural fingers. Instead, the fingers are blocky and rigid, lacking curvature or realistic spacing. The positioning of the fingers is stiff and uniform, with no indication of natural flexion or articulation. Moreover, the tips of the fingers are blunt and lack nail-like features. While the number of fingers is correct (five per hand), their form and positioning do not reflect natural human anatomy. In fact, the fingers appear somewhat merged or fused at the base due to the use of larger LEGO pieces, especially noticeable in the left hand. This is consistent with typical LEGO figure design, where simplicity and structural integrity override anatomical accuracy.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the LEGO statue centered on a flat white pedestal with realistic shadows and reflections that align with the lighting direction in the gallery?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO statue is positioned centrally on a white, rectangular pedestal, which is consistent with museum display standards. The pedestal is flat and clean, with no visible imperfections. The lighting in the gallery comes from overhead track lights, casting directional illumination from above and slightly to the sides. As a result, the statue casts soft, well-defined shadows beneath and to its sides, which align with the light source direction. Additionally, the polished floor reflects the statue and the surrounding environment, including the light fixtures and walls, creating realistic reflections that enhance the sense of depth and spatial consistency. These visual cues—shadow alignment, reflection clarity, and proper placement—indicate that the scene is rendered with attention to lighting physics and spatial logic. Therefore, the presentation of the statue on the pedestal is both visually coherent and physically plausible within the context of a modern art gallery.",
    "answer": "Yes"
