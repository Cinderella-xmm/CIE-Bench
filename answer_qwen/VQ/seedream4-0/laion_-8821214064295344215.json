      "question": "Are the mosaic tiles uniformly distributed across the entire surface of both teddy bears, maintaining consistent size and alignment without visible gaps or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the teddy bears are constructed from mosaic tiles, which appear to be small, square-shaped pieces arranged in a grid-like pattern. The tiles cover the entire surface of both bears, including their heads, bodies, limbs, and bows. While most areas show consistent tile size and alignment, there are subtle irregularities—especially around curved areas like the ears, paws, and facial features—where tiles appear slightly misaligned or vary in size to conform to the shape. For instance, the curvature of the paws and the roundness of the head require some tiles to be cut or adjusted, leading to minor inconsistencies. Additionally, slight gaps can be observed between certain tiles, particularly along the seams of the limbs and torso. These variations suggest that while the overall distribution is mostly uniform, it does not maintain perfect consistency across all surfaces. This conclusion is supported by general knowledge about mosaic art, where achieving perfect uniformity on complex 3D forms is challenging due to the need for shaping and fitting tiles to curves.",

      "question": "Do the yellow and turquoise tile patterns on the sweaters follow the original shape and contours of the garments without warping or breaking geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sweaters on both bears are made of mosaic tiles in yellow and turquoise colors. The yellow sweater on the left bear and the turquoise one on the right bear are designed with a pattern that attempts to mimic the original garment shape. However, due to the nature of mosaic tiling, especially on rounded surfaces, the tiles must be adapted to fit the curvature of the body. This adaptation results in some warping of the geometric shapes—particularly noticeable in the sleeve and torso areas where the tiles are stretched or compressed to match the form. For example, the circular pattern on the paws shows radial distortion, indicating that the tiles are not laid out in a perfectly regular grid but are instead adjusted to fit the spherical shape. Furthermore, the transition from the torso to the arms shows angular breaks in the tile alignment, suggesting that the original smooth contours of the sweater have been compromised. Based on principles of mosaic design and 3D modeling, such distortions are common when translating flat patterns onto curved surfaces. Therefore, while the overall shape is preserved, the geometric integrity of the tiles is altered.",

      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) clearly defined and proportionally correct using shaded tiles, without blurring or misalignment that compromises recognition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features of both teddy bears in Image B are composed of mosaic tiles. The eyes are small black tiles, the nose is a darker brown tile, and the mouth is represented by a simple line of dark tiles. Despite the mosaic medium, these features are generally recognizable and proportionally placed relative to the face. The use of contrasting colored tiles helps define the boundaries of each feature. However, due to the pixelated nature of the mosaic, the edges of the features appear slightly jagged or blurred, especially around the mouth and the outline of the nose. This is a natural consequence of using discrete tiles to represent continuous shapes. Additionally, the spacing between tiles creates minor visual interruptions that may reduce sharpness. Nevertheless, the overall proportions remain consistent with typical teddy bear designs, and the features are still clearly identifiable. Drawing from knowledge of digital and physical mosaics, this level of detail is acceptable given the medium’s limitations. Thus, while not perfectly smooth, the facial features are sufficiently defined and proportionate.",

      "question": "Do the bows retain their original shape and appear with a smooth, reflective surface that contrasts naturally with the surrounding mosaic fur?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bows on both bears in Image B are rendered in glossy, solid-colored tiles—yellow for the left bear and turquoise for the right. These bows are designed to mimic the appearance of satin ribbons, with a smooth, reflective surface. However, upon closer inspection, the bow's surface is not truly smooth; instead, it is composed of individual mosaic tiles that create a faceted, textured appearance. While the color and sheen suggest reflectivity, the underlying structure of tiles breaks the illusion of a seamless, smooth material. The contrast between the bow and the surrounding mosaic fur is strong due to the difference in color and finish, but the texture of the bow itself is inconsistent with the idea of a soft, flowing ribbon. In reality, a satin bow would not have visible tile edges or facets. Therefore, although the bow retains its general shape and has a shiny appearance, the surface lacks true smoothness and realism. This analysis aligns with expectations of how materials behave in real-world contexts—glossy surfaces should not exhibit visible segmentation unless intentionally stylized. Here, the effect is stylized but not fully convincing as a realistic reflection of fabric.",

      "question": "Is the white pedestal fully grounded beneath the bears, with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does it maintain clean edges and uniform color without blending issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two teddy bears are seated on a white pedestal. The pedestal appears to be a solid, cube-shaped object with clean, sharp edges and a uniform white color. There are no visible gaps between the bears' feet and the surface of the pedestal, indicating full contact and grounding. The base of the pedestal is flush with the floor plane, and there are no signs of floating or shadowing that would suggest suspension. The lighting is even, and the color remains consistent across the surface, with no gradients or blending into the background. The edges are well-defined, and the geometry of the pedestal is accurate, suggesting careful rendering or photography. From a visual perspective, the pedestal is properly anchored and visually coherent. This assessment is consistent with standard principles of composition and object placement in product photography or 3D rendering, where stability and clarity are emphasized. Therefore, the pedestal meets all criteria for being fully grounded and visually clean.",
