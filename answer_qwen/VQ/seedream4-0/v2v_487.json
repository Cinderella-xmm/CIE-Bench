      "question": "Does the 3D chibi-style figure appear to seamlessly emerge from the kayak without any visible breaks or unnatural intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style figure is positioned inside the kayak, holding a paddle. The figure appears to be digitally inserted into the scene, and upon close inspection, there are no visible seams or gaps between the figure and the kayak’s interior. The lighting and shadows on the figure align with the ambient lighting of the scene, suggesting that the integration was done carefully. The edges of the figure blend well with the kayak's contours, especially around the seat area, which supports a seamless appearance. There is no visual evidence of clipping, jagged edges, or misalignment that would indicate an unnatural intersection. This suggests that the figure has been rendered in a way that respects the spatial depth and geometry of the kayak.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are there any unnatural textures or artifacts present around the edges where the chibi figure meets the kayak?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the edges where the chibi figure meets the kayak, particularly around the seat and the surrounding plastic surface, there are no visible texture mismatches, pixelation, or chromatic aberrations. The smoothness of the kayak’s interior surface continues uninterrupted, and the shading on the figure matches the lighting direction consistent with the rest of the image. The transition from the matte black seat to the character’s clothing is clean, and no digital artifacts such as haloing or blurring are apparent. This indicates careful rendering and compositing techniques were used to maintain visual coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the proportions of the chibi figure relative to the kayak appear realistic and maintain structural consistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi figure is stylized with exaggerated features typical of cartoon characters—large head, small body—but within this artistic style, the proportions are internally consistent. However, when comparing the scale of the figure to the kayak, it appears slightly oversized for the cockpit. A real person would not fit so snugly in such a small space, but given the chibi aesthetic, this exaggeration is acceptable. The figure fits entirely within the kayak’s seating area, and the paddle extends naturally beyond the kayak without violating physical constraints. While not anatomically accurate to real-world proportions, the figure maintains structural consistency within its own stylized design language. Therefore, the proportions are appropriate for the intended artistic style.",

      "question": "Does the Polaroid photograph holding the scene appear naturally integrated into the overall composition without any distortion or unnatural placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Polaroid frame is held by a hand in the foreground, and it contains the original image (from Image A) with the added chibi figure. The Polaroid is angled slightly, casting a soft shadow beneath it, which enhances realism. The edges of the photo are clean and crisp, and the white border is uniform, suggesting high-quality rendering. The hand holding the photo appears natural, with realistic skin tone and fingernail detail, and the perspective matches the angle of the photo. There is no warping, stretching, or unnatural alignment that would suggest poor integration. The background behind the Polaroid is consistent with the surface seen in the original image, reinforcing continuity. Thus, the Polaroid is well-integrated into the scene.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Have the materials and textures of the kayak and skateboard remained consistent and undistorted after the addition of the chibi figure and Polaroid frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The kayak retains its bright yellow color, glossy finish, and detailed black bungee cords, all of which match the original image. The texture of the kayak’s surface remains smooth and reflective, with consistent highlights and shadows. Similarly, the skateboard’s grip tape, wooden edges, and metal trucks show no signs of distortion or texture corruption. Even though the chibi figure is added, the surrounding areas of the kayak and skateboard remain unchanged in material properties. The Polaroid frame does not obscure or alter these elements; instead, it frames them cleanly. The lighting across the entire scene remains coherent, indicating that the materials and textures have been preserved throughout the editing process.",
