      "question": "Are the edges of the church’s spire and rooflines smooth and continuous without jagged breaks or warped segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the edges of the church's spire and rooflines appear to be smooth and continuous. There are no visible jagged breaks or warped segments along these lines. The visual cues suggest that the artist has maintained a consistent line quality throughout the structure, which is typical in digital illustrations aiming for a clean and polished look.",

      "question": "Do the left and right halves of the church’s façade mirror each other exactly, causing any misalignment in window positions or wall contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining Image B, the left and right halves of the church’s façade seem to mirror each other closely. The windows and wall contours align well, suggesting symmetry. This is common in architectural illustrations where balance and symmetry are often emphasized for aesthetic appeal.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic gold accent on the spire in Image B appears uniform with a reflective sheen. There are no noticeable clashing textures or unnatural glow spots. The artist likely used a consistent color palette and shading techniques to achieve this effect, which is typical in stylized digital art.",

      "question": "Is the height of the spire proportionally balanced with the width and height of the church’s main body, avoiding extreme vertical stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spire's height in Image B seems proportionally balanced with the width and height of the church’s main body. There is no indication of extreme vertical stretching; instead, the proportions appear harmonious, reflecting an intentional design choice by the artist to maintain realistic architectural scaling.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The celestial background in Image B blends smoothly with the top edge of the church and the surrounding area. There are no abrupt color shifts or floating objects disrupting the scene. The artist has likely used gradient blending techniques to ensure a seamless transition between elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the window frames, arch designs, and roof tile patterns remain visible and clearly defined. The artist has preserved these details, ensuring they stand out against the colorful background. This level of detail is characteristic of high-quality digital illustrations that aim to retain the original features of the subject.",
