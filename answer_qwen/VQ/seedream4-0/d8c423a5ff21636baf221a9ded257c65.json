      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Is the head-to-body ratio of the figure exaggerated but still structurally coherent, with no visible warping or misalignment of facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B exhibits a stylized, chibi-like design commonly seen in collectible figurines or anime-inspired art. The head is significantly larger than the body, which is a deliberate artistic choice to emphasize cuteness and expressiveness. Despite this exaggeration, the facial features—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—are symmetrically placed and proportionally aligned within the head. There is no visible warping or distortion; the face maintains structural coherence, with smooth contours and balanced proportions. This style is consistent with known examples of kawaii or pop-art figurines where exaggerated features are used for aesthetic appeal without compromising visual harmony.",

      "question": "Does the dress exhibit a smooth, consistent porcelain-like surface with no rough patches, texture artifacts, or unnatural glare?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B appears to be made of a glossy, glazed material resembling porcelain or ceramic, typical of high-quality collectible figurines. The surface is uniformly smooth, with subtle reflections that suggest a polished finish. There are no visible texture artifacts such as pixelation, scratches, or uneven shading. The lighting across the dress shows soft highlights and gradients that mimic natural light interaction with a reflective surface, indicating careful rendering. No areas show unnatural glare or rough patches, suggesting a high level of detail in the material simulation.",

      "question": "Is the lamb positioned in the lap with sufficient volume and soft texture, and does it rest naturally within the hands without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lamb in Image B is rendered with a voluminous, fluffy appearance, consistent with the texture of wool. Its form is rounded and three-dimensional, giving it a sense of softness and weight. It is held securely by both hands, which wrap around its body in a natural pose. There is no clipping (where parts of the lamb intersect unnaturally with the hands or dress), nor is there any floating effect. The positioning suggests physical support, and the lamb’s legs are grounded on the base of the figure, reinforcing stability. The overall composition conveys a realistic sense of balance and contact.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the base beneath the figure aligned with the foreground plane and does it blend seamlessly with the background without casting incorrect shadows or creating floating effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the figure is clearly defined and rests flat on what appears to be a patterned floor, likely a painted rug or tapestry. The alignment of the base is parallel to the foreground plane, and its edges do not appear to hover above the surface. A soft shadow is cast beneath the base, consistent with overhead lighting, which enhances the perception of depth and grounding. The base also features ornate gold detailing that matches the classical architectural elements in the background, contributing to visual cohesion. There are no signs of floating or misalignment, and the integration between the base and surrounding environment is seamless.",

      "question": "Are the eyes proportionally enlarged but symmetrically placed, with no distortion in shape or spacing relative to the nose and mouth?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes in Image B are significantly larger than those found in realistic human proportions, a hallmark of stylized cartoon or anime aesthetics. However, they are symmetrically placed, centered horizontally, and evenly spaced from the nose and mouth. The shape of each eye is circular and consistent, with no asymmetry or warping. The pupils are well-defined and aligned with the gaze direction. The overall facial structure maintains balance despite the enlargement, which is a common technique in character design to convey emotion and charm without sacrificing structural integrity.",

      "question": "Do both hands have exactly five fingers each, with natural joint alignment and no extra or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, both hands of the figure in Image B display five fingers each. The fingers are proportionally sized and arranged in a natural arc, with visible knuckle joints that suggest articulation. There are no extra fingers or missing digits. The thumbs are correctly positioned opposite the other fingers, allowing for a secure grip on the lamb. While the hands are stylized and simplified compared to real anatomy, they maintain anatomical accuracy in digit count and basic joint alignment, which is typical for detailed collectible figurines.",

      "question": "Is the necklace and pendant clearly visible with consistent metallic texture and no pixelation or blurring around edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace in Image B is clearly rendered with a golden chain and a red gemstone pendant. The metal has a reflective sheen, suggesting a polished surface, and the edges of the chain links and pendant are sharp and well-defined. There is no visible pixelation or blurring, even in fine details like the clasp and the small drop below the gem. The texture appears uniform, and the lighting creates subtle highlights that enhance the metallic quality without introducing artifacts. This level of clarity indicates high-resolution rendering and attention to material detail.",

      "question": "Does the background retain the original sky gradient, horizon line, and mountain silhouette without visible seams or color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a painted landscape with a clear blue sky transitioning into lighter hues near the horizon, consistent with a traditional Renaissance-style backdrop. The horizon line is straight and continuous, separating the sky from distant mountains and greenery. The mountain silhouettes are softly rendered with atmospheric perspective, showing depth and layering. There are no visible seams, abrupt color shifts, or digital artifacts that would suggest image manipulation or拼接. The background appears cohesive and professionally composed, matching the classical aesthetic of the scene while maintaining visual continuity.",
