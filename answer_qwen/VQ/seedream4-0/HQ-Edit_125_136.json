      "question": "Are the shapes of the astronaut's helmet, suit segments, and life support pack simplified but still geometrically consistent with their original forms without jagged or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the astronaut’s helmet, suit segments, and life support pack are rendered in a stylized, cartoon-like manner. The helmet maintains a spherical shape with smooth curves and clean edges, consistent with real-life space suits, though simplified. The suit segments (arms, torso, legs) follow recognizable structural divisions typical of NASA-style spacesuits, such as segmented joints and modular components, but they are flattened and simplified for visual clarity. The life support pack is reduced to basic rectangular and circular forms, preserving its core function as a backpack unit. All shapes are composed of clean, smooth lines with no jagged or broken edges, indicating intentional simplification rather than distortion. This approach aligns with common practices in illustrative design where realism is balanced with clarity. Compared to Image A, which shows highly detailed, photorealistic elements, Image B uses abstraction while maintaining geometric fidelity. Thus, despite simplification, the forms remain consistent with real-world counterparts.",

      "question": "Does the texture applied to the spacesuit appear uniformly distributed and physically plausible, without unnatural repetition or artificial pattern artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the spacesuit lacks realistic surface textures such as fabric weave, stitching, or wear marks. Instead, it employs flat colors with minimal shading, typical of vector-based illustrations. There are no visible repeating patterns or artificial textures that would suggest digital artifacting. However, the absence of texture means it does not reflect the physical pliability or material properties of actual spacesuits, which have layered fabrics and flexible joints. While this lack of texture is intentional for stylistic reasons, it does not imply unnatural repetition—there are no tessellated or glitchy patterns. The uniformity is consistent with the illustration’s overall aesthetic. In contrast, Image A features rich surface details like folds, seams, and reflective materials, which simulate real-world physics. But since Image B is clearly an artistic interpretation, the 'texture' here is more about color blocking and form than physical realism. Therefore, the texture (or lack thereof) is uniformly applied and free from artifacts, even if not physically plausible.",

      "question": "Are the accent gold colors confined to specific design elements (such as patch borders or connectors) and do they blend naturally without color bleed into adjacent areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, gold accents are used sparingly and precisely on defined elements: the border of the American flag patch on the arm and the trim around the helmet visor. These applications are consistent with real spacesuit design, where gold-tinted visors and embroidered patches with metallic outlines are common. The gold color is cleanly delineated, with sharp boundaries and no visible bleeding into surrounding white or blue areas. There is no evidence of over-saturation or feathering that would suggest poor rendering. The use of gold is limited to functional or symbolic parts, enhancing visual hierarchy without overwhelming the design. Comparing to Image A, where gold may be used more subtly in reflective surfaces or hardware, Image B exaggerates these highlights for clarity and style. However, within its own illustrative context, the gold remains contained and well-integrated. Thus, the color application is deliberate and free from technical flaws.",

      "question": "Do the directional arrows show clear movement from the astronaut toward the ISS without overlapping or distorting the astronaut’s limbs or the station structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, two white directional arrows originate from the astronaut’s raised hand and point toward the International Space Station (ISS). The arrows are positioned above the astronaut’s arm and do not intersect with any part of the body or the ISS structure. They are clean, unbroken lines with arrowheads clearly indicating directionality. The spacing between the arrows and the astronaut’s limb is sufficient to avoid visual confusion or overlap. Similarly, the arrows do not cut through or distort the ISS modules or solar panels. Their placement suggests a logical flow of action—from preparation (astronaut) to navigation (toward ISS)—which matches the text below ('Step 2: Navigate'). This design choice enhances clarity without compromising spatial integrity. In Image A, there are no arrows, so no direct comparison can be made regarding overlay effects. However, in Image B, the arrows are strategically placed to guide the viewer’s eye without interfering with key elements. Hence, the directional indicators are effective and non-intrusive.",

      "question": "Is the text positioned at the bottom edge of the image without covering critical parts of the Moon or ISS, and is it clearly readable without distortion or shadow effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the text 'Step 1: Prepare → Step 2: Navigate → Step 3: Operate' is located along the bottom edge of the image, just above the horizon line of the Moon. It does not obscure any significant portion of the lunar surface or the ISS, which is positioned in the upper right quadrant. The text is set against a dark blue background, providing strong contrast with the white font, ensuring high readability. There are no shadows, blurs, or distortions affecting the lettering. The font is clean and sans-serif, suitable for instructional content. The layout places the text in a neutral zone where it does not interfere with the main subjects—the astronaut or the space station. In Image A, there is no text present, so no comparison is needed. However, Image B’s text placement follows best practices in graphic design: it is informative, legible, and unobtrusive. Therefore, the text meets all criteria for clarity and positioning.",
