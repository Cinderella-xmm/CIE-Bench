      "question": "Does the circular badge appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without any visible artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular badge in Image B appears to be a cohesive and stylized graphic with no visible artifacts or unnatural textures. The edges of the badge are smooth, and the elements within it (Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, London Eye) are depicted in a consistent artistic style that blends well together. There is no indication of pixelation, distortion, or other visual disruptions that would suggest poor integration.",

      "question": "Are the fingers of the hand holding the badge correctly shaped and detailed, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fingers holding the badge in Image B are illustrated in a cartoonish style. They appear correctly shaped for a hand, with natural curvature and proportions relative to each other. The level of detail is appropriate for the style, showing clear segmentation between the fingers without any signs of unnatural deformations.",

      "question": "Do the features of the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye on the badge retain their recognizable shapes and proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The features of the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and London Eye on the badge retain their recognizable shapes and proportions despite being stylized. The Statue of Liberty's torch and crown, the Eiffel Tower's lattice structure, and the London Eye's circular form are all identifiable. The artistic interpretation maintains enough fidelity to the original landmarks for them to be easily recognized.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the addition of the badge preserve the structural consistency of the surrounding landmarks, without causing any visual disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The addition of the badge does not preserve the structural consistency of the surrounding landmarks because the badge itself is an artificial element superimposed onto the scene. However, within the context of the badge, the landmarks are depicted consistently with their real-world counterparts. The badge acts as a separate layer that doesn't disrupt the actual scene outside of its boundaries.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the tassels on the badge depicted with natural textures and details, contributing to the overall visual quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tassels on the badge are depicted with a simple yet effective design that contributes positively to the overall visual quality. They have a natural texture implied by the color gradients and shading, and the details are sufficient to convey the idea of tassels without overcomplicating the image. The style matches the rest of the badge's artwork.",
