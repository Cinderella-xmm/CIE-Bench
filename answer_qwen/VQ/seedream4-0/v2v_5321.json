      "question": "Do the stripes on the character's costume maintain their clarity and definition without unnatural blurring or distortion in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's costume features stripes that appear consistent and well-defined. The claymation style typically involves a certain level of texture and slight imperfections, but the stripes here maintain their clarity without any noticeable blurring or distortion. This is evident by observing the uniformity and alignment of the stripes across the shirt. There are no signs of unnatural blending or warping that would suggest a loss of definition.",

      "question": "Does the beret retain its original shape and placement on the character's head without appearing unnaturally warped or misplaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beret in Image B appears to retain its original shape and placement on the character's head. It sits naturally atop the head with no visible warping or misplacement. In claymation, objects can sometimes lose their form due to manipulation, but the beret maintains its rounded shape and position as expected for such a style. Comparing it to typical beret placements in real life or other media, it looks appropriately positioned.",

      "question": "Are the fingers on the character's hand holding the phone naturally shaped and textured, without any unnatural distortions or missing details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fingers on the character's hand holding the phone in Image B do not appear naturally shaped or textured. They seem overly simplified and lack detailed articulation that would be present in a realistic depiction. Claymation often simplifies details, but the absence of natural curvature and individual finger definition suggests an unnatural distortion. This contrasts with how human hands typically look when grasping an object.",

      "question": "Do the European rooftops and buildings in the background retain their structural integrity and visual plausibility without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The European rooftops and buildings in the background of Image B retain their structural integrity and visual plausibility. The shapes and lines of the buildings remain coherent and recognizable as urban architecture. There are no obvious distortions or unnatural textures introduced that would disrupt the scene's realism. The background elements align well with what one would expect from a cityscape view.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the character's pose, including the way they hold the phone, appear natural and consistent with human ergonomics in the claymation style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's pose in Image B, including the way they hold the phone, appears somewhat natural within the constraints of claymation. While the hand holding the phone lacks fine detail, the overall posture and arm positioning seem consistent with human ergonomics. Claymation often simplifies movements and poses, but this particular stance does not introduce any significant ergonomic inconsistencies.",
