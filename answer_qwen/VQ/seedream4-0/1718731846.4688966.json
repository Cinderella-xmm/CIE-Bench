    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the entire body of the dog exhibit a uniform, polished wood texture with visible grain patterns that follow the contours of the figure, without abrupt transitions or unnatural patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dog's body appears to have a uniform wood texture with visible grain patterns that follow the contours of the figure. The texture is consistent across the entire body, and there are no abrupt transitions or unnatural patches. This conclusion is drawn from observing the smooth flow of the wood grain along the curves and edges of the dog's form, which suggests careful craftsmanship.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the black-and-white facial pattern accurately represented by distinct dark and light wood tones along the central vertical line of the face, with no smudging or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black-and-white facial pattern in Image B is represented by distinct dark and light wood tones along the central vertical line of the face. There is no smudging or misalignment; the transition between the dark and light areas is sharp and well-defined, accurately reflecting the original pattern. This analysis is based on the clear demarcation and alignment of the wood tones with the facial features.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the facial features—such as the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth outline—accentuated with fine, realistic carved lines that enhance depth without distorting proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B, such as the eye sockets, nose bridge, and mouth outline, are accentuated with fine, realistic carved lines that enhance depth without distorting proportions. These lines are subtle yet effective in giving a three-dimensional appearance to the face. The reasoning here involves noting the precision and placement of these lines relative to the overall facial structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do all body parts—head, ears, legs, and paws—maintain smooth, rounded contours consistent with the original form, without flattened areas or sharp edges that suggest poor carving?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All body parts in Image B—head, ears, legs, and paws—maintain smooth, rounded contours consistent with the original form. There are no flattened areas or sharp edges that suggest poor carving. Each part flows seamlessly into the next, indicating a high level of skill in carving. This assessment is made by examining the continuity and smoothness of the contours throughout the figure.",

      "question": "Is the dog placed on a flat, minimalist wooden platform that matches the material tone and finish of the figure, with proper grounding and consistent lighting shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dog in Image B is placed on a flat, minimalist wooden platform that matches the material tone and finish of the figure. The platform provides proper grounding, and the lighting shadows are consistent, enhancing the realism of the scene. This conclusion is reached by observing the harmony between the platform and the figure, as well as the natural appearance of the shadows.",
