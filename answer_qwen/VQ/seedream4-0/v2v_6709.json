      "question": "Does the perfume bottle appear to be constructed from Lego bricks without any visible unnatural textures or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the perfume bottle is clearly constructed from Lego bricks. The visual cues include the distinct studs and uniform block shapes characteristic of Lego construction. There are no visible unnatural textures or artifacts that would suggest otherwise; the transition to Lego form appears seamless in terms of texture. The analysis process involves recognizing the familiar pattern and structure of Lego bricks and comparing it with the object's appearance.",

      "question": "Does the fabric background transformed into Lego bricks maintain a natural appearance without any obvious distortions or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric background in Image B has been transformed into Lego bricks. However, this transformation introduces distortions and unnatural shapes. The smooth, flowing nature of fabric cannot be accurately represented by rigid, angular Lego pieces, leading to an obvious departure from a natural appearance. The analysis involves understanding the inherent properties of fabric versus the geometric constraints of Lego bricks.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the perfume bottle and the fabric background preserved, avoiding any distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the perfume bottle seem preserved as it maintains its recognizable shape and size relative to the background. However, the physical rationality is compromised due to the use of Lego bricks for the fabric, which distorts the expected softness and flow of fabric into rigid, blocky forms. Comparing with Image A, where the fabric flows naturally, the edited version lacks coherence in physical properties despite maintaining general proportions.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the edited image, with the perfume bottle and fabric background made of Lego bricks, retain visual credibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition retains some visual credibility as the main elements (perfume bottle and background) are still identifiable. However, the coherence is affected by the unrealistic transformation of the fabric into Lego bricks. While the layout remains similar to Image A, the unnatural representation of the fabric detracts from the overall visual harmony and realism.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the fine details of the perfume bottle and the fabric background accurately represented in the Lego brick form without any loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fine details of the perfume bottle are reasonably represented in Lego brick form, capturing the essence of its design. However, the fabric background loses significant detail due to the rigid nature of Lego bricks, which cannot replicate the subtle nuances and textures of fabric. Thus, while the bottle retains some detail, the background suffers a loss of detail.",
