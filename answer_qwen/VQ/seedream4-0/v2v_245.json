      "question": "Does the character's transformation into an anime-style action figure maintain natural textures and fine details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in the box is an anime-style action figure, which inherently has a stylized and less detailed texture compared to real-life objects. The fine details are simplified as part of the design aesthetic typical for action figures. There are no visible unnatural artifacts that disrupt the visual integrity of the figure within its context as a toy. The transformation from a human figure to an action figure involves a change in style rather than an introduction of artifacts.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the box design seamlessly integrate with the rest of the image, maintaining visual credibility without disrupting the overall scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The box design includes vibrant colors and cartoonish elements that contrast with the more realistic airplane and human figure. While it adds a playful element, the stark difference in art styles between the box and the rest of the image can be seen as disrupting the overall scene's visual credibility. The box appears somewhat out of place due to its highly stylized nature against the more photorealistic background.",

      "model_answer": "No",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the airplane-related elements incorporated into the box design proportionally correct and physically rational, avoiding any distortion or unnatural shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small airplane depicted on the box is proportionally much smaller than the actual airplane in the background, which is expected given the scale of the action figure and the box. However, the proportions and shapes of the airplane on the box appear consistent with typical toy designs and do not exhibit any distortion or unnatural shapes that would make them physically irrational.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the character's dynamic pose atop the small airplane wing appear structurally consistent and visually credible, without any unnatural deformations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's pose atop the small airplane wing is dynamic and exaggerated, which is characteristic of anime-style action figures. Despite the dramatic stance, there are no visible deformations or inconsistencies that would make the pose appear structurally incorrect. The pose is designed to be visually striking and fits within the stylistic norms of such figures.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the textures and materials of the hyper-realistic figure beside the box rendered realistically and naturally, resembling a professionally photographed product?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hyper-realistic figure beside the box is rendered with high detail and natural textures, resembling a professionally photographed product. The lighting, shadows, and material properties of the clothing and skin are consistent with what one would expect from a high-quality photograph. This rendering contributes to the overall realism of the figure in comparison to the surrounding elements.",
