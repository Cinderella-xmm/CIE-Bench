      "question": "Does the unfurled scroll form of the map maintain smooth, continuous curvature without jagged edges or distorted grid lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the scroll form of the map appears to have a smooth curvature. The edges are not jagged, and the grid lines on the map maintain their continuity without distortion. This is assessed by observing the natural flow of the scroll's edge and ensuring that the lines within the map do not exhibit any abrupt changes or breaks which would indicate distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the spokes of the ship's wheel evenly spaced, structurally intact, and consistent in thickness and metallic texture with the original compass material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spokes of the ship's wheel in Image B appear evenly spaced and structurally intact. They share a consistent thickness and metallic texture similar to what one would expect from a compass material depicted in such an artistic style. Comparing this with Image A, where the compass has intricate details and a metallic finish, the ship's wheel in Image B complements it well without any noticeable discrepancies in design or texture.",

      "question": "Are the silhouettes of the explorers clearly distinguishable, proportionally small relative to the map scale, and placed along plausible travel paths without overlapping key geographical labels?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The silhouettes of the explorers in Image B are clearly distinguishable and proportionally small relative to the map scale. They are placed along plausible travel paths indicated by the red dotted lines and do not overlap with key geographical labels. This placement makes sense in the context of a voyage map, as explorers would logically follow established routes.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is the typography aligned with the vintage aesthetic, free from pixelation or blurring, and positioned so that it does not obscure major elements such as the compass or continental outlines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The typography in Image B aligns well with the vintage aesthetic, showing no signs of pixelation or blurring. It is positioned strategically so that it does not obscure major elements like the compass or continental outlines. The font style and clarity contribute to the overall historical theme of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the red dotted lines form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map that align with known historical exploration routes and avoid cutting through landmasses or key symbols?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red dotted lines in Image B form continuous, non-overlapping paths across the map. These paths align with what could be considered known historical exploration routes, avoiding cutting through landmasses or key symbols. This suggests careful planning to ensure the paths make logical sense within the context of a historical voyage map.",
