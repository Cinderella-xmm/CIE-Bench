      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the road sections composed of clearly defined angular shapes that align logically with the perspective and curvature of the original road, without floating or misaligned fragments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the road sections are composed of angular shapes that align logically with the perspective and curvature expected in a road. The shapes appear to follow the natural flow of the road's direction, maintaining a sense of depth and continuity. There are no floating or misaligned fragments; each section seems to connect seamlessly with the next, adhering to the principles of linear perspective.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the cloud formations consist of layered quadrilateral shapes that overlap in a way consistent with atmospheric depth, without abrupt edges or disconnected blocks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cloud formations in Image B are depicted using layered quadrilateral shapes. These shapes overlap in a manner that suggests atmospheric depth, creating an illusion of clouds at varying distances. The edges are not abrupt, and there are no disconnected blocks, which helps maintain a cohesive appearance consistent with how clouds might be perceived in a stylized representation.",

      "question": "Are the telegraph poles rendered as angular or geometric structures that maintain vertical alignment and proportional relationships between the pole and crossbars, without visible warping or structural collapse?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The telegraph poles in Image B are rendered as angular structures that maintain vertical alignment. The crossbars are proportionally related to the poles, and there is no visible warping or structural collapse. The geometric design preserves the essential characteristics of telegraph poles while adapting them to the artistic style of the image.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the tree canopies represented as solid triangular or pyramid-like shapes that sit naturally on the ground and do not float above the terrain or intersect with the road guardrails?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree canopies in Image B are represented as solid triangular or pyramid-like shapes. They sit naturally on the ground without floating above the terrain or intersecting with the road guardrails. This geometric interpretation of trees maintains their connection to the landscape while fitting within the overall abstract style of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the colors across the road surface, sky, and surrounding vegetation uniformly distributed within the specified muted palette, without isolated bright spots, color bleeding, or textural noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors across the road surface, sky, and surrounding vegetation in Image B are uniformly distributed within a muted palette. There are no isolated bright spots, color bleeding, or textural noise. The consistent use of muted tones contributes to a harmonious and cohesive visual experience, appropriate for the stylized nature of the artwork.",
