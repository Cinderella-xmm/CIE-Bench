      "question": "Is the white studio background uniformly flat and free of shadows, texture mismatches, or visible edges where it meets the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a clean, bright white studio backdrop. Upon close inspection, there are no visible shadows cast by the toy onto the background, nor are there any texture mismatches such as graininess or unevenness. The edge where the toy meets the background appears seamless, with no visible hard lines or digital artifacts that would suggest an unnatural cutout. This uniformity is typical of professional product photography setups using high-key lighting to minimize shadows and create a clean, distraction-free environment. The absence of any gradient, shadow, or texture variation confirms that the background is uniformly flat and well-integrated with the subject.",

      "question": "Is the logo tag on the hippo’s ear properly aligned with the knit texture, showing realistic thread stitching and no unnatural color or shape distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo tag attached to the hippo’s ear appears to be a small rectangular label with a blue border and a white center containing a stylized logo. The tag is affixed to the knit fabric near the ear, and its edges align reasonably well with the surrounding knitted pattern. However, upon closer examination, the stitching around the tag does not appear to integrate seamlessly with the knit texture—there is a slight lack of continuity in the thread pattern, suggesting it may have been digitally added rather than physically stitched. Additionally, the tag’s surface lacks subtle shading or texture that would mimic real fabric, and its edges appear slightly too sharp compared to the soft, textured appearance of the rest of the toy. This suggests some degree of artificial rendering, indicating minor unnaturalness in the integration.",

      "question": "Does the circular patch on the hippo’s side have consistent knit texture and thickness with the surrounding fabric, without raised or detached appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular patch on the hippo’s side is a small embroidered-style badge with a blue border and text. It is placed on the body of the toy, which is made of a knitted material with distinct horizontal stripes. The patch appears to be slightly raised compared to the surrounding fabric, and its texture differs from the knit pattern—it has a smoother, more rigid surface that contrasts with the soft, ribbed texture of the toy. This difference in texture and elevation suggests that the patch is either a sewn-on label or a digitally inserted element that does not fully blend with the knit material. In real-world textile products, such patches are often slightly raised due to their construction, but here the contrast is pronounced enough to suggest inconsistency in thickness and texture, making it appear somewhat detached.",

      "question": "Is the packaging box positioned behind the toy at a natural distance, with consistent lighting and shadow alignment that matches the direction of light on the toy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging box is placed directly behind the toy, at a moderate distance that allows both objects to be clearly visible. The lighting in the scene is even and diffused, typical of studio photography, and the shadows cast by the toy fall forward and slightly to the right, indicating a light source from the upper left. The box itself casts a faint shadow that aligns with the same direction, suggesting consistent lighting. However, the box appears to be slightly out of focus compared to the toy, which could indicate a shallow depth of field used to emphasize the product. More importantly, there is no visible misalignment in shadow direction or intensity between the toy and the box. The placement feels natural, and the lighting is coherent across both elements, supporting a realistic spatial relationship.",

      "question": "Is the plastic window on the box front transparent with subtle reflections and no distortion of the toy’s image visible through it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plastic window on the front of the box is designed to showcase the product inside. In this image, however, the window appears to be transparent but shows no visible reflection or refraction effects that would normally occur with real plastic. Instead, the view through the window is perfectly clear, with no distortion, glare, or subtle imperfections like scratches or smudges. While this might seem ideal, in reality, a plastic window would typically exhibit some level of reflection or minor optical distortion due to surface curvature or material properties. The absence of these effects suggests that the window may have been digitally rendered or edited to appear flawless, lacking the physical realism expected in a real product shot. Therefore, while the transparency is correct, the lack of any natural optical behavior indicates an unnatural representation.",

      "question": "Are the text elements clearly visible, correctly spaced, and rendered with smooth edges without jaggedness or overlapping with other objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'Summer Pals Collection' is printed on the top of the box in a cursive font. The letters are legible, evenly spaced, and have smooth edges without pixelation or jaggedness, indicating high-resolution rendering. The text is centered and does not overlap with any other elements such as the window or decorative patterns. The font style is consistent with branding for children's toys, and the color (a soft pink) contrasts well with the light background, enhancing readability. There are no signs of blurring, aliasing, or clipping against nearby design elements. All visual cues suggest that the text was professionally typeset and integrated into the packaging design with care.",
