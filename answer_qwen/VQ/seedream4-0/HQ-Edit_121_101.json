      "question": "Are the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar clearly defined with clean, sharp edges consistent with a paper-cut style, and do they feature uniform metallic foil highlights without smudging or color bleed?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the floral patterns on the sleeves and collar are rendered in a layered, cut-out style typical of paper art. The edges of the flowers and leaves are sharply delineated, showing clean, precise lines that mimic the look of intricately cut paper. This is consistent with the paper-cut aesthetic, where each element is distinct and not blended into adjacent areas. Additionally, the metallic foil highlights—especially visible on the petals and stems—are applied uniformly across the patterns, reflecting light consistently and lacking any signs of smudging or bleeding into neighboring colors. The overall appearance suggests careful layering and application, avoiding diffusion at boundaries, which reinforces the impression of a high-quality paper-cut design. These visual cues align with known characteristics of traditional paper art, where clarity and separation of elements are essential.",

      "question": "Is the enlarged bow positioned centrally and symmetrically on the jeogori, maintaining smooth fabric folds around it without unnatural creasing or geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bow in Image B is significantly larger than typical traditional bows found in hanbok attire, but it is centered along the vertical axis of the jeogori (the upper garment). Its placement appears symmetrical, with equal spacing from both sides of the torso. The surrounding fabric folds are stylized to follow the contours of the bow, with soft, flowing lines that suggest draping rather than rigid structure. However, due to the artistic nature of the paper-cut medium, the folds are simplified and lack realistic depth or texture. While there is no obvious geometric distortion such as warped angles or asymmetry, the exaggerated size of the bow introduces a stylized interpretation rather than anatomical accuracy. Nonetheless, within the context of this artistic representation, the symmetry and alignment are preserved. The folds remain consistent with the intended aesthetic of layered paper art, even if they deviate from real-world textile behavior.",

      "question": "Do the roof lines and structural components of the background architecture maintain proper alignment and perspective, avoiding skewed angles or floating elements that suggest structural inconsistency?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background architecture in Image B is depicted using a layered paper-cut technique, with multiple tiers of roofs extending outward. Despite being stylized, the roof lines are parallel and evenly spaced, maintaining a consistent horizontal alignment across each tier. The eaves curve upward symmetrically on both sides, following traditional Korean palace architecture such as Gyeongbokgung. There are no floating elements; all structural parts appear grounded and connected logically. The perspective is slightly flattened due to the two-dimensional nature of the artwork, but there is no skewing of angles or misalignment between layers. The use of repeating patterns and proportional scaling supports a coherent spatial arrangement. Given that this is a decorative representation rather than a photorealistic depiction, the architectural elements are accurately abstracted while preserving key features like tiered roofing and symmetrical layout. Thus, the structure remains internally consistent within its artistic framework.",

      "question": "Is the embossed leather-bound panel uniformly textured across its surface, with no visible seams or irregularities where the stamped elements meet the background, and does it provide a consistent depth impression?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outer border of Image B resembles an embossed leather-bound panel, featuring intricate scrollwork and ornamental designs. The texture across the surface is uniform, with consistent relief patterns that suggest deep stamping. There are no visible seams or breaks in the material, indicating a seamless integration of the decorative elements into the background. The depth impression is maintained through subtle shading and shadowing, especially around the raised motifs, which gives a tactile sense of dimensionality. The transition between the embossed designs and the plain leather background is smooth, with no abrupt changes or inconsistencies in texture. This suggests skilled craftsmanship in the rendering of the leather effect, mimicking real embossing techniques used in bookbinding or luxury goods. Therefore, the panel presents a cohesive, high-quality appearance with consistent depth and texture.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the chain have exactly five fingers with natural joint curvature and skin texture, and does the chain follow a continuous, non-intersecting path without breaking or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand in Image B is rendered in a stylized paper-cut form. It has five distinct fingers, each shaped with slight curvature at the joints, resembling natural finger articulation. However, due to the flat, layered nature of the artwork, there is no realistic skin texture—instead, the surface is smooth and uniform, typical of paper cutouts. The chain held by the hand follows a continuous loop from the bag to the fingers, with no visible breaks or intersections. Each link appears intact and aligned, forming a logical path without detachment. While the hand lacks detailed anatomical realism, it maintains functional proportions and a clear connection to the chain. In the context of paper art, where simplification is expected, the representation is accurate enough to convey the intended action. Thus, although the texture is absent, the number of fingers and continuity of the chain are correctly represented.",
