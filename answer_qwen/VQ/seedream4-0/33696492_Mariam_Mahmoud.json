      "question": "Are the wing-shaped shelves formed from the original bookshelves smooth and continuous without jagged edges or missing segments, and do they feature leaf textures that blend naturally with the wood?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there are no visible 'wing-shaped shelves' derived from the original bookshelves. Instead, the bookshelves remain largely intact as wooden structures filled with books, though they are now embedded within a fantastical forest environment. The transformation does not involve reshaping the bookshelves into wings. Therefore, the premise of 'wing-shaped shelves' is incorrect. There are no such structures present in the image. Based on visual analysis, the original bookshelves have not been morphed into wing-like forms with leaf textures. This conclusion is drawn from direct observation—no part of the shelving unit resembles wings or has leaf patterns integrated into its surface. Thus, the answer must be 'No'.",

      "question": "Do the hanging fungi occupy the same positions as the original lamps, have rounded caps and stems resembling real mushrooms, and display a soft glow without visible artifacts or unnatural brightness gradients?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hanging objects above the seating area are indeed mushrooms, replacing what were originally woven pendant lamps in Image A. These fungi are suspended from tree branches in the ceiling structure and are positioned approximately where the lamps were located. They possess rounded caps and slender stems consistent with real mushroom morphology, particularly species like *Amanita muscaria* or similar glowing varieties. Their glow is soft and diffused, emitting a gentle light that enhances the mystical atmosphere without harsh highlights or digital artifacts. The lighting gradient appears natural, suggesting an internal luminescence rather than artificial illumination. Comparing to Image A, where the lamps were centrally placed and symmetrically arranged, the mushrooms in Image B maintain similar spatial placement but with organic variation, fitting the forest theme. The transition from artificial lighting to bioluminescent fungi is seamless in terms of positioning and aesthetic coherence. Hence, all criteria are met.",

      "question": "Are the chair and stool replacements shaped like natural rocks with uneven surfaces and moss coverage that follows realistic growth patterns, and do they retain a size suitable for human seating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chairs and stools have been replaced with objects resembling moss-covered stones. These rock-like forms are irregular in shape, with rough, uneven surfaces typical of natural boulders. Moss is distributed across their surfaces in patches, following realistic growth patterns—thicker in shaded areas and thinner on exposed parts—consistent with how moss grows in damp, forested environments. The size of these stone seats is proportionate to human scale; they are large enough to support a person sitting comfortably, matching the dimensions of the original wicker furniture in Image A. While the materials have changed from woven rattan to stone, the functional design remains intact. The transformation preserves usability while enhancing thematic immersion. Therefore, both the appearance and functionality align with naturalistic expectations.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the book-to-bird transformations show complete bird bodies with defined heads, wings, and tails, and do the feathers contain readable text fragments arranged in a natural pattern without distorted letters or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several birds are depicted perched on chairs, and upon close inspection, their feathers appear to be composed of text fragments. These birds have clearly defined anatomical features: heads with beaks, fully formed wings, and tails. The text embedded in the feathers is legible in parts, with words and phrases visible in a script resembling handwriting or typewritten text. The arrangement of the text follows the natural curvature of the feathers, maintaining a plausible biological texture. There are no obvious distortions or gaps in the lettering, and the integration of text into the plumage seems intentional and artistically coherent. This transformation suggests a metaphorical fusion of literature and nature, where books have literally become living creatures. Compared to Image A, where books were static objects on shelves, Image B reimagines them as dynamic entities. The continuity of content (text) within the form (bird) supports the idea of narrative becoming alive. Thus, the transformation meets both structural and textual criteria.",

      "question": "Are the entwined branches forming the ceiling connected and interlaced in a natural way without gaps or floating segments, and do they cast shadow patterns that align with the light source direction seen in the original image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the ceiling is composed of thick, gnarled tree branches that intertwine overhead, creating a canopy-like structure. These branches are densely connected, forming a continuous network with no visible floating or disconnected segments. The interlacing follows natural growth patterns observed in old trees, with overlapping limbs and organic curves. The shadows cast by these branches onto the floor below match the directional lighting coming from above, consistent with sunlight filtering through foliage. The shadow grid aligns with the light source angle, reinforcing the realism of the scene. In comparison to Image A, which had a structured bamboo ceiling with regular slats casting linear shadows, Image B maintains a similar shadow logic but adapts it to a more chaotic, natural pattern. Despite the difference in material and form, the shadow alignment remains coherent with the light source. Therefore, the branches are naturally connected and produce realistic shadow effects.",
