      "question": "Does the character's 3D chibi appearance maintain structural consistency and visual credibility without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character inside the snow globe is rendered in a chibi (super-deformed) style, which is characterized by exaggerated proportions such as a large head, small body, and simplified features. Despite these stylizations, the character retains key elements of the original design—such as the horned helmet, fur-lined armor, and shield—consistent with the aesthetic of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The proportions are deliberately altered for stylistic effect, but there are no visible distortions like warped limbs, floating parts, or inconsistent geometry. The smooth surface textures, clean edges, and coherent shading suggest a high-quality 3D model. Given that chibi styles inherently involve intentional exaggeration, the character’s appearance remains visually credible within this artistic framework. There are no signs of rendering artifacts such as jagged lines, pixelation, or clipping.",

      "question": "Are the tiny evergreen trees and miniature mountain peaks inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, the miniature landscape includes small evergreen trees and rocky mountain peaks covered in snow. The trees have conical shapes typical of pine or fir species, with textured foliage that mimics real-world needle patterns. The mountains exhibit angular rock formations with snow accumulation on ridges and slopes, consistent with alpine terrain. There are no obvious geometric anomalies, such as flat faces where curvature should be, or unnatural color gradients. The snow appears soft and layered, not uniformly white or artificially applied. These elements are rendered with attention to detail, suggesting a deliberate effort to mimic natural forms at a reduced scale. No visible artifacts such as texture seams, repeated patterns, or digital glitches are present. Thus, the scene maintains visual plausibility within the context of a crafted diorama.",

      "question": "Do the icy reflections and gentle sparkles created by the soft daylight filtering through the frosty window appear natural and free from unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The window in the background is frosted with ice crystals, and light filters through it, creating subtle glints and soft highlights on the glass surface. These effects are consistent with how sunlight interacts with frozen glass—producing diffused illumination and scattered sparkle-like particles (often referred to as 'bokeh' or 'light flares') due to refraction. The reflections on the snow globe are smooth and curved, matching the spherical shape, and show faint distortions of the background, which is accurate for transparent curved surfaces. The sparkles are distributed evenly and softly, resembling actual snowfall or light scattering in cold air. There are no over-saturated colors, harsh edges, or artificial-looking glitter that would suggest digital over-processing. The lighting is cohesive with the environment, reinforcing the wintry atmosphere without introducing visual inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe resting atop a stone pedestal near a frosty window integrate seamlessly with the snowy mountain range outside, maintaining visual plausibility without any obvious distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe sits on a weathered stone pedestal positioned in front of a large window overlooking a snowy mountain range. The composition creates a sense of depth and continuity between the indoor object and the outdoor scenery. The lighting is consistent across both environments—soft, diffused daylight suggesting a winter morning. The frost patterns on the window frame align naturally with the cold climate implied by the exterior mountains. The reflection in the snow globe subtly mirrors the surrounding landscape, reinforcing spatial coherence. There are no visible mismatches in perspective, scale, or lighting direction that would break immersion. The transition from the interior (stone, wood, glass) to the exterior (snow, rock, sky) feels seamless, supported by shared color tones (blues, whites, grays) and atmospheric haze. This integration suggests careful environmental design and post-production harmony.",

      "question": "Do the character's shield and sword retain their proper shapes and proportions within the 3D chibi style, avoiding any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the chibi version of the character, the shield is held in one hand and appears as a circular object with a central boss, consistent with traditional Nordic shields seen in Skyrim. Its size relative to the character's body is slightly enlarged for emphasis, which is common in chibi art to maintain recognizability. The sword is sheathed at the character's side and has a proportionally shortened blade and hilt, again fitting the chibi aesthetic. Both items maintain their core shapes—round shield, straight-edged sword—without warping, stretching, or breaking apart. The textures and silhouettes remain distinct and coherent. While proportions are exaggerated for stylistic reasons, they do not introduce distortions that compromise recognition or visual logic. The modeling avoids issues like intersecting geometry or missing parts, indicating a well-executed adaptation of game assets into a stylized form.",
