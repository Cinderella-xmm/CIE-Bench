      "question": "Does the chibi-style 3D figure maintain the correct proportions and physical rationality of the skateboarder's mid-action pose without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style 3D figure inside the snow globe is stylized with exaggerated features typical of chibi art—such as a large head, small body, and simplified limbs. While this style inherently alters human proportions for cuteness and cartoonish appeal, the figure still captures the essence of a skateboarding mid-air trick. The pose mimics the original action: one leg bent, the other extended, arms out for balance, and the skateboard tilted beneath the feet. Although not anatomically accurate, the pose remains physically plausible within the context of chibi animation, where motion and balance are conveyed through gesture rather than realism. Therefore, despite the stylistic exaggeration, the figure maintains a reasonable level of physical rationality in its mid-action stance.",

      "question": "Are the tiny palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe naturally integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The palm trees and ramps inside the snow globe are scaled down versions of real-world objects, consistent with the miniature nature of such dioramas. The palm trees have textured fronds and trunks that resemble natural foliage, albeit simplified. The ramps are smooth and geometrically coherent, with clean edges and appropriate angles for skateboarding features. There are no visible artifacts like jagged lines or inconsistent shading that would suggest broken geometry. The integration of these elements into the snowy base and glass enclosure appears seamless, with proper depth and lighting effects that suggest they are part of the same scene. Given that snow globes often contain idealized, slightly stylized landscapes, the inclusion of palm trees in a snowy environment is whimsical but not visually jarring—especially since it contrasts humorously with the tropical theme. Thus, the textures and shapes are consistent with artistic expectations for such a novelty item.",

      "question": "Do the character's clothing and skateboard retain their fine details and natural textures inside the snow globe?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the chibi styling, the character’s clothing—black t-shirt, olive-green pants, and black sneakers with white soles—retains recognizable design elements. The texture of the fabric appears smooth and consistent with typical digital rendering standards for stylized figures. The skateboard has clearly defined grip tape, wooden deck edges, and wheels, all proportionate to the character’s scale. While not photorealistic, the details are sufficient to identify the components accurately and are rendered with clarity and consistency. In a chibi or toy-like representation, fine textural detail is often simplified, but here, the essential features are preserved without visual errors or distortions. Therefore, the textures remain coherent and appropriate for the medium.",

      "question": "Does the snow globe resting on the table near the window appear structurally consistent and visually credible with realistic light scattering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snow globe is placed on a wooden surface near a window, with sunlight streaming in from the side, casting soft shadows and creating lens flare effects. The glass sphere shows realistic refraction and reflection patterns, including subtle distortions of the background scene through the curved surface. Light rays enter the globe and scatter internally, producing a glowing effect around the central figure, which enhances the sense of depth and transparency. The base is solid and stable, matching the form factor of real snow globes. These optical effects—such as caustics, glare, and internal reflections—are rendered convincingly, suggesting high-quality 3D modeling and lighting simulation. The overall composition feels grounded in physical plausibility, even though the content inside is fantastical.",

      "question": "Does the snow falling inside the snow globe look natural and enhance the lively atmosphere without appearing artificial or out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflakes inside the globe are depicted as small, white particles floating at varying speeds and directions, simulating the random motion seen in real snow globes when shaken. They are distributed throughout the space, with some closer to the viewer and others farther away, creating a sense of depth. The particles do not follow rigid paths and vary in size, contributing to a more organic appearance. Additionally, the gentle glow from the sunlight interacting with the flakes adds to the magical ambiance. While snowfall in a tropical-themed scene (with palm trees) is conceptually surreal, it is common in decorative snow globes to include such juxtapositions for whimsy. Therefore, the snowfall is visually convincing and enhances the playful, dreamlike quality of the scene without appearing jarringly artificial.",
