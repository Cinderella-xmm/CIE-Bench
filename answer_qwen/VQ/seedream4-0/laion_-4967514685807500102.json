      "question": "Does the shrimp character’s arm and hand have five fingers with natural curvature and spacing, and are they attached at a logical joint point without deforming the shrimp’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the shrimp character is anthropomorphized with limbs resembling human arms and hands. Observing the arm and hand in the first panel, the hand has five distinct fingers, each with a curved shape and reasonable spacing that mimics a human hand. The fingers appear to be articulated at a joint-like structure near the shrimp's body, which is stylized but maintains a plausible connection point. While the design is cartoonish, the proportions and attachment do not distort the shrimp’s body; instead, the limbs are integrated in a way that respects the character’s overall form. This reflects common practices in animated characters where human-like features are added without compromising the core anatomy of the original creature. Therefore, based on visual cues and typical animation standards, the limbs are logically designed.",

      "question": "Does the chef’s hat cast a subtle shadow on the shrimp and have visible fabric texture and creases consistent with real-world materials?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the first panel of Image B, the shrimp wears a white chef’s hat. The hat appears to be drawn with folds and creases that suggest fabric material, such as cotton or linen, commonly used for chef hats. These folds are distributed naturally, indicating volume and softness. However, there is no clear shadow cast by the hat onto the shrimp’s head or body, which would typically be expected under directional lighting. Shadows are absent or extremely minimal, likely due to the flat, illustrative style of the comic. While the texture is implied through line work, the lack of shading reduces realism. Thus, while the texture is suggested, the absence of a visible shadow limits its consistency with real-world physics.",

      "question": "Is the hand gripping the lemon slice positioned with fingers properly curved and spaced, and does the lemon retain its natural wedge shape and surface texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the second panel of Image B, the shrimp holds a lemon wedge in its hand. The fingers are curved around the lemon in a manner that suggests a realistic grip—each finger wraps around the edge, maintaining appropriate spacing and curvature. The lemon itself is depicted as a standard wedge, with a smooth, slightly textured rind and a visible pulp section, consistent with how lemons are typically represented in illustrations. The shape is anatomically accurate for a cut lemon, and the surface details (such as the pith and segments) are present, enhancing believability. There is no distortion or exaggeration that would make it look unnatural. Given these observations, both the hand positioning and lemon representation align well with real-world expectations.",

      "question": "Are the motion lines aligned with the shrimp’s direction of movement and do the herb particles appear to be dispersing from a logical origin point near the shrimp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the third panel of Image B, the shrimp is shown mid-motion, seemingly throwing herbs into the air. The motion lines radiate outward from behind the shrimp, suggesting forward momentum, which is consistent with the direction of movement. The herbs are scattered in a dynamic arc, originating from near the shrimp’s mouth or claws, indicating they were tossed or blown out. The dispersal pattern follows a logical trajectory—particles are farther from the center as they move away, simulating gravity and airflow. This use of motion lines and particle dispersion is a common technique in comics to convey action and energy. The visual elements align with principles of physics and animation, making the scene believable within the context of a stylized illustration.",

      "question": "Are the shrimp tails arranged in a stable, gravity-consistent pile with overlapping layers and no floating or suspended pieces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the fourth panel of Image B, the shrimp stands atop a large mound of cooked shrimp tails. The pile appears dense and layered, with individual shrimp overlapping in a way that suggests natural stacking under gravity. There are no visibly floating or suspended pieces—each tail seems to rest on another, forming a cohesive heap. The arrangement mimics how food items might accumulate when piled up, with some tails pointing upward and others downward, adding to the sense of depth and stability. While the pile is exaggerated for dramatic effect, it remains physically plausible given the artistic style. No elements defy gravity or spatial logic, so the composition is consistent with real-world expectations.",

      "question": "Are all text elements clearly legible, positioned without overlapping key visual elements, and rendered with consistent stroke thickness and style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B includes the title 'Shrimpy’s Spicy Adventure!' and several speech bubbles. The title uses bold, red, stylized lettering with a black outline, placed at the top of the image where it does not interfere with any characters or actions. All speech bubbles are positioned near their respective characters and do not overlap important visual components like faces or hands. The font style is consistent across all text elements—bold, rounded, and comic-style—with uniform stroke thickness. Even the smaller text in the speech bubbles maintains clarity and readability. The layout ensures that viewers can easily read the dialogue without distraction. Based on these observations, the text design adheres to best practices in comic book typography.",
