      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, mouth) on the feather earrings proportionally sized and seamlessly integrated into the feather surface without distorting the engraved lines or creating unnatural texture contrasts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feather earrings have been anthropomorphized with cartoon-style facial features, including eyes, cheeks, and mouths. These features are drawn in a stylized, exaggerated manner typical of comic art. The eyes are large and round, placed near the top of the feather, while the mouth is small and red, positioned below. The cheeks are rosy and circular. While these elements are clearly added for humor and character, they are not proportionally scaled to realistic human features; instead, they follow cartoon logic where expressive exaggeration is acceptable. Importantly, the facial features are overlaid on the feather’s surface without physically altering the engraved lines—these lines remain visible beneath the face, indicating that the design preserves the original feather pattern underneath. There is no evidence of distortion in the engraved lines due to the addition of the face, and the texture contrast between the metallic silver and the flat color of the face is intentional and stylistic rather than unnatural. Thus, while not 'realistic,' the integration is coherent within the artistic context.",

      "question": "Is the central black oval stone on each feather preserved and unobscured by the added facial features, and do the engraved lines of the feather remain symmetrical and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the central black oval stone, which was originally present in Image A as a distinct feature within the feather design, has been visually altered. In this edited version, the stone is still present but partially obscured by the placement of the facial features—specifically, the eyes are located directly over the area where the stone would be, effectively covering it. This is a deliberate artistic choice to integrate the face into the earring's structure, but it means the stone is no longer fully visible. Additionally, the engraved lines of the feather appear slightly modified around the eye region to accommodate the cartoon style, though overall symmetry is maintained. However, the central stone is not preserved in its original form—it is functionally replaced by the eyes. Therefore, while the general shape and symmetry of the feather are retained, the key detail of the unobscured black stone is lost.",

      "question": "Is there a visible and logically connected arm-like extension from one earring to the other, suggesting motion, and are both earrings still properly attached to their hooks without floating or detachment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both earrings are depicted as animated characters running along a path. One earring extends an arm-like limb toward the other, holding a stick or pole that connects them, symbolizing motion and interaction. This arm is clearly drawn as part of the cartoon character, extending naturally from the side of the feather body. The connection suggests cooperative movement, reinforcing the dynamic scene. Both earrings retain their original hook attachments at the top, which are clearly visible and correctly positioned, indicating they are still securely fastened. There is no floating or detachment; both earrings are grounded on the path and linked through the shared action. The visual logic supports continuity and proper attachment despite the animation.",

      "question": "Is the text bubble positioned near the head of the anthropomorphic earring, clearly legible, and free from overlapping or covering essential details of the earrings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble in Image B is located above the left earring (from the viewer’s perspective), close to its 'head' region, which is consistent with standard comic book conventions for dialogue. The text inside reads, 'Let’s soar to new heights today!' and is written in a clear, legible font. It does not overlap with any critical parts of the earrings such as the hooks, stones, or main feather design. Instead, it floats above the scene without obscuring the earrings themselves. The positioning enhances the narrative without interfering with the visibility of the jewelry. The layout respects both readability and visual hierarchy, ensuring that the message is accessible while preserving the integrity of the image’s subject matter.",

      "question": "Do the bold outlines follow the exact contours of the earrings without gaps or misalignment, and are the vibrant colors applied consistently without pixelation, blurring, or loss of fine engraved details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B uses a comic-style illustration with bold black outlines that closely follow the shape of the earrings. The outlines are clean and continuous, matching the contours of the feathers, hooks, and facial features without noticeable gaps or misalignments. The coloring is vibrant and consistent—silver for the metal, black for the eyes and stone areas, and red for the mouths. However, due to the stylization, the fine engraved lines present in the original metallic feather (as seen in Image A) are simplified or omitted in favor of broader strokes and shading appropriate for cartoon art. This simplification results in a loss of the intricate detailing seen in the real object, but it is intentional and stylistically consistent. There is no pixelation or blurring; the image appears crisp and digitally rendered. Therefore, while the fine engraved details are not preserved, the bold outlines and color application are accurate and well-executed within the artistic medium.",
