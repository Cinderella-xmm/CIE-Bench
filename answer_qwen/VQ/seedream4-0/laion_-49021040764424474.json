      "question": "Are the orange, black, and silver sections of the truck's body composed of clearly defined LEGO brick patterns with uniform size and alignment, avoiding blurred or inconsistent textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the truck is constructed entirely from LEGO bricks. The orange sections of the body (such as the cab and fenders) are made up of uniformly sized rectangular LEGO bricks arranged in a consistent pattern, which is typical for LEGO models. The black components (like the bed and roof) also show clear, repeating brick patterns with uniform alignment. Silver elements (e.g., side steps and wheel rims) are built using flat or angled LEGO pieces that maintain geometric consistency. There are no visible signs of blurring, texture inconsistency, or irregular spacing—each brick appears to be precisely placed. This aligns with standard LEGO construction principles where modular parts must fit together seamlessly. Therefore, based on visual inspection and knowledge of LEGO design, the surfaces exhibit clear, uniform brick patterns.",

      "question": "Do the wheels consist of circular gray LEGO-style pieces with correct proportions and no deformation, maintaining a solid geometric structure without jagged edges or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are constructed from gray LEGO pieces designed to mimic realistic tires. They feature circular, multi-layered structures with tread patterns formed by raised studs, consistent with LEGO tire designs. The rims are composed of concentric circular elements with proper symmetry and proportion relative to the tire width. While LEGO wheels inherently have a pixelated or blocky appearance due to their modular nature, they do not display deformation, jagged edges, or distortion. The overall geometry remains intact and symmetrical, indicating accurate construction. This is supported by world knowledge that LEGO vehicles use standardized wheel designs that maintain structural integrity despite being made of discrete blocks. Thus, the wheels appear correctly proportioned and undistorted.",

      "question": "Is the truck bed fully covered with smooth, flat black LEGO tiles arranged in a regular grid pattern without gaps, overlaps, or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the truck bed in Image B, it is covered with black LEGO tiles that form a flat surface. These tiles are arranged in a regular grid pattern, consistent with how LEGO builders typically construct flat surfaces. There are no visible gaps between the tiles, nor any overlapping or misaligned edges. The surface appears even and continuous, reflecting careful assembly. LEGO tiles are specifically designed to create smooth, flush surfaces when properly aligned, and this model adheres to that principle. Additionally, the tailgate area shows continuity with the same tiling, reinforcing the idea of precision in construction. Given these observations and knowledge of LEGO tile usage, the bed surface meets the criteria of being smooth, regularly patterned, and flawlessly assembled.",

      "question": "Is the LEGO truck positioned securely on a flat white shelf with no visible gaps or floating effects, and does the shelf extend appropriately beneath the full width of the truck?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO truck rests on a clean, flat white shelf. The shelf extends horizontally under the entire length and width of the vehicle, providing full support. There are no visible gaps between the truck’s undercarriage and the shelf, suggesting stable placement. The shelf appears to be solid and level, with no indication of floating or suspension effects. The lighting and shadows confirm physical contact between the truck and the shelf. From a modeling perspective, placing a detailed LEGO build on a display shelf like this is common practice to ensure stability and presentation quality. Based on visual cues and real-world display standards, the truck is securely and fully supported by the shelf.",

      "question": "Are all major structural components such as the tailgate, side steps, and bumpers correctly reconstructed in LEGO form with accurate proportions and proper alignment to the rest of the truck body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the LEGO truck in Image B, the tailgate is constructed with black LEGO tiles and panels that match the scale and shape of the original truck, hinged correctly at the rear. The side steps are built using long, flat silver LEGO pieces that run parallel to the doors and are aligned properly with the body. The bumpers (front and rear) are made from black LEGO elements that follow the curvature and proportions of the real vehicle. All components are integrated seamlessly into the overall structure, with no misalignment or disproportionate sizing. This reflects an accurate reconstruction of the vehicle’s key features using LEGO bricks, adhering to both aesthetic and structural logic. Comparing to known LEGO vehicle builds, such attention to detail and proportional accuracy is typical for high-fidelity models. Therefore, all major components are correctly reconstructed.",
