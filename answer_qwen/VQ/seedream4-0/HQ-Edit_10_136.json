      "question": "Does the enlarged strumming hand have five fingers with natural joint alignment and ergonomic shape, without any extra digits or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the girl's strumming hand is depicted in a cartoon style, which often simplifies anatomical details. However, upon close inspection, the hand appears to have five fingers, each with visible joints and a generally ergonomic shape consistent with human anatomy. The fingers are slightly curved as if pressing the guitar strings, which is typical for playing an acoustic guitar. There are no visible extra digits or exaggerated bends that would suggest unnatural positioning. While cartoon styles may exaggerate proportions, the hand maintains a plausible structure. This conclusion is based on visual cues such as finger count, joint placement, and curvature, combined with general knowledge of human hand anatomy and common artistic conventions in stylized illustrations.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the girl’s face, hair, and clothing smoothly integrated into the cartoon style without jagged lines, pixelation, or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B features a watercolor-style cartoon illustration. The edges of the girl’s face, hair, and clothing show soft transitions and smooth outlines, consistent with the artistic technique used. There are no sharp, jagged lines or pixelation, which are typically signs of low resolution or poor rendering. The shading is consistent with the watercolor aesthetic—gradual and blended—without abrupt changes. The hair has subtle gradients and flow, and the clothing maintains clean, rounded contours. These characteristics align with high-quality digital art in a stylized format. Therefore, based on visual analysis and understanding of digital illustration techniques, the edges are well-integrated into the cartoon style.",

      "question": "Do the watercolor band logos on the wall have soft brushstroke textures and natural color gradients without sharp digital edges or unnatural color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The posters on the wall in Image B are rendered in a watercolor style, evident from their soft, diffused edges and blended color transitions. Each poster displays visible brushstroke-like textures and gradual shifts in hue, mimicking real watercolor painting techniques. There are no hard, digital-looking edges or areas where colors appear to bleed unnaturally (e.g., overly saturated or smudged). Instead, the color transitions are smooth and organic, consistent with how watercolors behave when applied to paper. This observation is supported by world knowledge of watercolor art, where transparency, layering, and fluidity are key characteristics. Thus, the posters reflect a realistic interpretation of watercolor effects.",

      "question": "Is the cat silhouette positioned on the bed without overlapping the edge of the blanket or pillow, and does it have smooth, non-jagged edges with a uniform pastel fill?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cat silhouette in Image B is placed on the bed, specifically on the upper right side near the headboard. It does not overlap the edge of the blanket or pillow; instead, it sits fully within the boundaries of the bedding area. The outline of the cat is smooth and lacks jagged edges, consistent with vector-based or digitally refined illustrations. The fill color is a soft pastel gradient (pinkish-white), applied uniformly across the silhouette without patches or inconsistencies. This matches the overall artistic style of the image, which emphasizes gentle tones and clean shapes. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of digital illustration practices, the cat is properly positioned and rendered.",

      "question": "Is the writing box proportionally sized relative to the stool, and does it cast a subtle shadow consistent with the room's lighting direction without appearing floating or detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The writing box in Image B is located on the floor near the bed, to the right of the stool. Visually, it appears smaller than the stool, which is reasonable given typical object proportions—a writing box being compact and a stool being larger and more substantial. The box casts a faint shadow beneath it, aligned with the light source coming from the window on the left, suggesting directional lighting from the left. The shadow is soft and consistent with the ambient lighting in the room, avoiding harshness or unnatural angles. There is no indication that the box is floating or disconnected from the surface; its base touches the floor, and the shadow grounds it visually. This consistency supports the perception of depth and realism within the stylized environment. Therefore, based on spatial reasoning and understanding of lighting in 2D art, the box is proportionally accurate and well-integrated.",
