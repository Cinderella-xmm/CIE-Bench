      "question": "Are the eyes positioned just below the label and do they follow the curvature of the bottle with consistent lighting and reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes are clearly visible just below the white label on the wine bottle. They are placed symmetrically and appear to be drawn directly onto the surface of the bottle. The eyes follow the curvature of the bottle, as their shape is slightly distorted in a way that matches the cylindrical form—this is evident from the subtle horizontal elongation and the way light reflects off the surface around them. The reflections and highlights on the bottle suggest a smooth, glossy surface, and the eyes maintain consistent lighting with no harsh shadows or unnatural glares, indicating that they were integrated into the scene with attention to surface continuity. This suggests a coherent rendering where lighting and reflection are consistent with the bottle's material and shape.",

      "question": "Do the vines wrap around the bottle in a continuous, physically plausible manner without floating or intersecting the bottle in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vines in Image B wrap around the bottle in a way that appears organic and continuous. They originate from the base of the bottle and spiral upward, mimicking natural vine growth patterns. The vines are rendered with realistic texture and thickness, and they conform closely to the bottle’s curvature without appearing to float or pass through the glass unnaturally. There are no visual gaps or intersections where the vines seem to clip through the bottle’s surface. Instead, they appear to grow around it, with slight shadows and depth cues reinforcing their three-dimensional presence. The integration of the vines with the bottle is visually convincing and follows principles of botanical realism and spatial coherence.",

      "question": "Is the modified label icon a clear, proportionate face with distinct features that match the original icon's style and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The label icon in Image B shows a small scarecrow figure wearing a hat, which matches the original design seen in Image A. However, in Image B, this icon has been modified to include facial features such as eyes and a mouth, giving it a more expressive, cartoonish appearance. While the overall shape and style (e.g., the hat and simple body) remain consistent with the original, the addition of a face alters its proportion and detail. The face is not merely a scaled version but an artistic reinterpretation, and its features (eyes, mouth) are distinct and stylized. However, due to the added complexity and change in purpose (from symbolic logo to character), it does not strictly match the original icon’s minimalist style or size. Therefore, while recognizable, it is not proportionate or stylistically identical to the original.",

      "question": "Does the background include layered grapevines and mist that recede naturally without obscuring or clipping the bottle incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a detailed vineyard scene with rows of grapevines, clusters of grapes, and atmospheric mist. The layers of vegetation and terrain create a sense of depth, with the vines in the foreground being more detailed and those in the distance fading into soft focus, which is typical of depth-of-field effects. The mist adds to the atmospheric perspective, enhancing the illusion of space. Importantly, the bottle remains fully visible and centered, with no parts of the background elements (like vines or grapes) overlapping or clipping into the bottle in a way that breaks the illusion of depth. The positioning and scaling of the background elements respect the bottle’s volume and placement, ensuring it is not obscured or distorted by the environment. Thus, the background integrates well with the subject.",

      "question": "Is the title \"The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure\" clearly visible, correctly positioned, and free from rendering artifacts such as pixelation or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'The Curious Scarecrow Wine Adventure' is prominently displayed in the upper right portion of Image B. It is written in a stylized, serif font with a golden hue that contrasts well against the dark sky background. The text is sharp, legible, and properly aligned. There are no visible signs of pixelation, blurring, or color bleeding—the edges of the letters are clean, and the anti-aliasing appears smooth. The positioning is balanced within the composition, neither too close to the edge nor obstructing key visual elements like the bottle or vines. The rendering quality is high, suggesting professional digital artistry with attention to typography and visual clarity.",
