      "question": "Does the lime wedge retain its natural green hue and textured rind, with no visible distortion or pixelation, even after being shaped into a smiling cap?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lime wedge has been transformed into a smiling cap with anthropomorphic features. Despite this transformation, it retains its green hue and textured rind. The visual cues suggest that the lime's natural characteristics have been preserved in the digital editing process, as there is no visible distortion or pixelation affecting its appearance. The analysis is based on observing the color and texture consistency of the lime slice compared to typical lime appearances.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the two ice cubes positioned as eyes clearly defined as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges and no deformation, and do they sit naturally within the liquid without appearing to float unnaturally?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two ice cubes in Image B are positioned as eyes within the glass. They appear as solid, translucent cubes with sharp edges, fitting naturally within the liquid. There is no deformation, and they do not float unnaturally, which aligns with how ice cubes typically behave in a beverage. This conclusion is drawn from observing their shape, transparency, and placement relative to the liquid level.",

      "question": "Is the sugar rim along the glass edge uniformly granular and continuous, with no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring that disrupts the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sugar rim along the glass edge in Image B appears uniformly granular and continuous. There are no visible breaks, smearing, or artificial coloring disrupting the natural appearance of salt/sugar crystals. The uniformity and continuity are assessed by examining the texture and distribution of the granules around the rim, which seem consistent with real-world sugar rims.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the sombrero and maracas have consistent material textures (e.g., woven straw, wood grain, reflective beads), correct scale relative to the glass, and proper shadows that match the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sombrero and maracas in Image B exhibit consistent material textures appropriate for their respective materials—woven straw for the sombrero and wood grain for the maracas. Their scale relative to the glass seems correct, and shadows match the lighting direction, suggesting realistic proportions and lighting effects. This assessment involves comparing the textures and shadows to expected real-world properties and lighting behavior.",

      "question": "Are the confetti pieces varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows, and do they appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The confetti pieces in Image B are varied in color and shape, with soft edges and subtle shadows. They appear to lie on the surface without floating or overlapping unrealistically. This observation is based on analyzing the colors, shapes, edges, and shadows of the confetti pieces, ensuring they conform to realistic physical properties and interactions with the surface.",

      "question": "Is the text “Fiesta Time!” clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements, and does it have consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text “Fiesta Time!” in Image B is clearly visible, evenly spaced, and positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting other elements. It has consistent stroke width and anti-aliasing, contributing to its clarity and legibility. This evaluation considers the text's visibility, spacing, positioning, and technical qualities like stroke width and anti-aliasing, all of which indicate proper design and placement.",
