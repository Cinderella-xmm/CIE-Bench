      "question": "Does the transformed tapestry gown maintain continuous and coherent fabric folds and draping without visible seams or distorted geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tapestry gown appears to have a smooth flow with consistent fabric folds that suggest natural draping. The intricate patterns on the gown are aligned in a way that does not indicate any abrupt changes or distortions. There are no visible seams disrupting the continuity of the fabric, which implies careful attention to detail in the design. The overall coherence of the garment's structure suggests that it has been rendered with an understanding of how fabric behaves under gravity and movement.",

      "question": "Are the platinum jewelry pieces (necklace, earrings, bangles) proportionally accurate and free from unnatural glares, misshapen forms, or inconsistent material textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jewelry pieces in Image B appear to be proportionally accurate relative to the wearer's size and the scale of the image. The necklace, earrings, and bangles exhibit a reflective quality typical of platinum with embedded gemstones. There are no noticeable unnatural glares or misshapen forms; the light reflections seem consistent with the material's expected properties. The texture of the jewelry is uniform, suggesting a high level of craftsmanship in the rendering.",

      "question": "Do the newly added elements in the background (stars, luminous flowers, lanterns) follow consistent lighting direction and depth cues without creating visual inconsistencies or floating objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background elements in Image B, including stars, luminous flowers, and lanterns, are integrated with a sense of depth and lighting consistency. The stars are scattered across the sky with varying brightness levels, simulating a natural night sky. The luminous flowers and lanterns emit soft glows that interact with their surroundings, giving them a grounded appearance rather than floating. The overall scene maintains a harmonious balance between these elements and the subject, indicating thoughtful composition.",

      "question": "Are both hands correctly formed with five fingers each, natural joint alignment, and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the subject are clearly visible and appear to be correctly formed. Each hand shows five fingers with natural joint alignment, and there are no signs of overlapping or missing digits. The positioning of the hands is such that they complement the posture of the subject, and the fingers are detailed enough to confirm their proper formation.",

      "question": "Do the luminous flowers and ethereal lanterns exhibit smooth gradients and soft glows without jagged edges or artificial halos?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminous flowers and ethereal lanterns in Image B display smooth gradients and soft glows that enhance their magical appearance. The edges of these elements are well-defined but not jagged, contributing to a seamless integration into the scene. There are no harsh or artificial halos around the lights, which helps maintain the enchanting atmosphere of the image. The overall effect is one of gentle illumination that adds to the fantasy setting.",
