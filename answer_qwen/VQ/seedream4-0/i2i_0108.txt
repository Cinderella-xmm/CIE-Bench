    "Question": "Q1: Does the boundary where the character appears to break out of the television screen show no obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the character (Captain America) is depicted as emerging from a television screen, creating a visual effect that blends 3D elements with a 2D display. The boundary between the character and the screen is carefully rendered, with smooth edges and no visible pixelation, jagged lines, or seams that would suggest digital artifacts. The transition from the screen’s flat surface to the three-dimensional form of the character is seamless, using depth cues such as lighting and shadow to enhance realism. The edges of the character's suit and shield align naturally with the screen's frame, and there are no signs of texture repetition or rendering errors. This suggests that the image was created with high-quality compositing techniques, likely involving 3D modeling and advanced post-processing to maintain visual coherence. Based on these observations and common standards in digital art and visual effects, the boundary appears clean and artifact-free.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the shield held in a manner that complements the character's posture without introducing distorted or broken geometric shapes?",
    "explanation": "The shield is positioned in front of Captain America’s body, angled slightly outward, which is consistent with a defensive stance. The hand gripping the shield is proportionally aligned with the forearm and elbow, suggesting a natural pose. The circular geometry of the shield remains intact—its concentric rings and central star are clearly defined and symmetrical, indicating no warping or distortion. Additionally, the way the shield interacts with light (reflections and highlights) matches its metallic surface properties and the surrounding environment. There are no signs of geometric anomalies such as stretched edges, misaligned contours, or unnatural curvature. From a physics and anatomy perspective, the grip and orientation of the shield appear plausible for a human figure in motion. Thus, the shield's placement and shape are consistent with both the character's posture and realistic object behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the lighting and reflections on the character's suit consistent with the environment, avoiding any loss of details or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The lighting in Image B is dynamic and layered, originating primarily from the ambient glow of the television screen and possibly an external source above. The character’s suit reflects this illumination with subtle highlights on the metallic star, shoulder pads, and chest armor, which are consistent with the material properties of polished metal and fabric. The reflections on the helmet and shield are sharp but not overly exaggerated, maintaining clarity and depth. Shadows fall logically across the suit, particularly under the arms and along the torso, reinforcing the three-dimensionality of the figure. The background screen emits blue and purple hues that subtly tint the character’s skin and clothing, which is a realistic chromatic response. There are no visible banding, over-saturation, or missing textures—details like stitching, fabric folds, and belt buckles remain crisp. Given these factors, the lighting and reflections are well-integrated into the scene and preserve visual fidelity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the visible parts of the character’s body maintain proper proportions, avoiding distortion or unnatural scaling?",
    "explanation": "The visible portions of Captain America’s body—including his head, torso, arms, and legs—are proportionally accurate when compared to typical human anatomy and the established design of the character in media. His head is correctly scaled relative to his shoulders and torso, and his limbs maintain natural joint angles and muscle definition. The thickness of the arms and the width of the shoulders suggest a strong, athletic build, consistent with the character’s portrayal. There is no evidence of stretching, compression, or disproportionate scaling that would indicate digital manipulation errors. Furthermore, the symmetry of the suit and the alignment of the gear (such as the utility belt and straps) reinforce anatomical correctness. Even though the character appears to be 'breaking' out of the screen, the physical dimensions remain consistent with real-world expectations, ensuring believability within the stylized context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the addition of the character breaking out of the screen maintain the visual continuity of the background and avoid disrupting other elements in the scene?",
    "explanation": "The background consists of a modern room setting with a wooden desk and a large flat-screen TV displaying a futuristic interface. The character emerges from the screen, but the interaction is designed to preserve visual continuity. The screen’s content includes digital overlays that mirror the character’s appearance, creating a narrative link between the displayed image and the physical figure. The edges of the screen are not obscured or distorted by the character’s presence; instead, the character appears to extend beyond the screen’s plane while maintaining spatial coherence. The reflection and ambient lighting on the screen surface match the character’s illumination, preventing abrupt contrasts. Moreover, the desk and surrounding environment remain undisturbed—no objects are displaced or unnaturally altered. This careful integration suggests intentional design choices to make the illusion believable without compromising the integrity of the scene. Therefore, the addition enhances rather than disrupts the overall composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"
