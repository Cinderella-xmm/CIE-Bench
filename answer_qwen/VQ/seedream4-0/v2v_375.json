      "question": "Do the chibi-style characters maintain natural proportions and avoid unnatural distortion in their body shapes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style characters in Image B exhibit exaggerated and stylized proportions typical of this art style. Their heads are larger relative to their bodies, and their limbs are simplified and shortened. This is a deliberate artistic choice rather than an unintentional distortion. The body shapes are consistent with the chibi aesthetic, which prioritizes cuteness and simplicity over natural human proportions.",
