      "question": "Do the zebra's stripes on the chibi character appear consistent with the original pattern without unnatural distortions or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi zebra's stripes are simplified and stylized to fit the character design. The stripes follow a consistent pattern that is typical for cartoon or chibi art styles, where details are minimized for a cute and appealing look. There are no unnatural distortions as the stripes maintain their characteristic black and white contrast, though they are less detailed compared to a realistic depiction. This simplification is common in chibi art to emphasize cuteness over realism.",

      "question": "Does the chibi zebra's interaction with the miniature cake appear natural and free from any obvious artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi zebra appears to be interacting with the miniature cake by placing a small zebra figurine on top of it. The interaction seems intentional and part of the playful design of the scene. There are no visible artifacts or distortions around the zebra's hands or the cake that would suggest an unnatural interaction. The proportions and positioning appear deliberate and fitting within the context of the image.",

      "question": "Is the chibi zebra seated on the edge of the Instagram frame in a way that appears structurally coherent and visually credible?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi zebra is seated on the edge of the Instagram frame in a manner that aligns with the artistic style of the image. The seating position is coherent with the overall composition, as the zebra is comfortably placed without any structural inconsistencies. The visual credibility is maintained because the frame acts as a platform for the character, which is a common technique in digital illustrations to integrate characters into themed designs.",

      "question": "Does the inclusion of the username \"ZebraLover\" and social media icons blend seamlessly into the scene without disrupting the overall natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inclusion of the username \"ZebraLover\" and social media icons is designed to mimic the layout of an Instagram post. These elements blend seamlessly into the scene as they are positioned and styled to resemble typical social media interface components. They do not disrupt the natural appearance of the illustration but rather enhance the thematic presentation of the image as a social media post.",

      "question": "Are the materials used for the chibi zebra and the cake natural in appearance, without any obvious unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The materials used for the chibi zebra and the cake have a smooth and uniform texture that is consistent with digital art techniques. The zebra's fur and the cake's surface lack the complex textures seen in real-life materials, which is expected in a stylized digital illustration. The absence of obvious unnatural textures indicates that the materials were intentionally designed to be visually appealing and cohesive within the art style.",
