    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the eyes and smile drawn on the yellow surface of the front tart smooth, consistent in color with the surrounding custard, and free from jagged edges or unnatural texture disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the eyes and smile on the yellow surface of the tart are smooth and consistent in color with the surrounding custard. The edges of these features appear soft and there are no jagged lines or unnatural texture disruptions visible. This conclusion is drawn by observing the uniformity and integration of the drawn features with the rest of the tart's surface.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the forest creatures on the crust rim appear proportionally small, properly aligned with the curve of the crust, and have soft, coherent textures without visible pixelation or clipping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The forest creatures on the crust rim of the tart in Image B are proportionally small and properly aligned with the curve of the crust. Their textures appear soft and coherent, without any visible pixelation or clipping artifacts. This assessment is based on the seamless blending of the creatures into the image and their realistic proportions relative to the tart.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the swirling path extend smoothly from the base of the front tart into the background, with consistent shading and perspective, and without sharp edges or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The swirling path in Image B extends smoothly from the base of the tart into the background. It maintains consistent shading and perspective, with no sharp edges or floating segments. This analysis is supported by the natural flow and continuity of the path as it integrates with the surrounding environment.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the green foliage and pastel flowers positioned around the tart at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing and no overlapping or clipping onto the tart’s body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The green foliage and pastel flowers around the tart in Image B are positioned at a realistic distance, with proper shadowing that suggests depth. There is no overlapping or clipping onto the tart’s body, indicating careful placement and attention to detail in the image composition.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze), with only non-destructive additions applied, and are there no distortions such as warped edges or missing layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Comparing Image A and Image B, the two tarts retain their original shape, size, and layered structure (crust, custard, top glaze) in Image B. Non-destructive additions such as the face, animals, and background have been applied without causing distortions like warped edges or missing layers. This conclusion is reached by noting the preservation of the tart's structural integrity despite the added elements.",
