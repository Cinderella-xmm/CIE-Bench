    "explanation": "In Image B, the cartoon versions of the two boys have heads and facial features that are stylized but not exaggerated or distorted in a way that would be considered unrealistic for cartoons. The proportions appear consistent with typical human anatomy as interpreted in animated styles, where slight exaggerations are common but still recognizable. This is analyzed by observing the overall head shape, eye placement, and other facial features which align with standard cartoon representations.",
