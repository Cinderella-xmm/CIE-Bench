      "question": "Does the brocade doublet on the man have consistent texture, visible pattern details, and natural fabric folds that conform to his body shape without distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brocade doublet worn by the man in Image B features a richly detailed floral and ornamental pattern typical of Renaissance or Baroque-era garments. The texture appears consistent across the surface, with no abrupt changes or pixelation, suggesting high-resolution rendering. The fabric folds are well-defined and follow the contours of the man’s torso and arms, indicating a realistic drape that conforms to his musculature and posture during movement. The puffed sleeves and tailored waistline maintain structural integrity, and the seams align naturally with the body’s form. There is no visual evidence of stretching, warping, or unnatural creases that would suggest digital distortion. This level of detail and anatomical accuracy supports the conclusion that the doublet is rendered with attention to textile physics and historical authenticity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the flowing skirt of the woman’s gown composed of layered, translucent fabric with natural ruffles and soft gradients, and do the jeweled accents appear embedded rather than pasted on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woman's skirt in Image B exhibits multiple layers of fabric, with the outermost layer appearing semi-transparent and delicately ruffled, creating a sense of volume and movement as if caught mid-twirl. The color transitions from gold to silver with soft gradients, enhancing the luxurious appearance. The ruffles are not uniformly stiff but show dynamic curvature consistent with fabric flow under motion. The jeweled accents along the hem and bodice are integrated into the design with metallic threading and gem-like inlays that follow the garment’s contours. They are not flat or overly bright like digital overlays; instead, they reflect light subtly and appear physically attached, mimicking real embroidery or beading techniques. These elements together suggest a high-quality rendering where materials are realistically simulated.",

      "question": "Do the marble floor tiles display continuous veining patterns and subtle reflections, and are the chandeliers structurally sound with clear crystal elements and warm light diffusion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The marble floor in Image B shows large, polished tiles with natural-looking veining that flows continuously across the surface, resembling genuine marble such as Carrara or Calacatta. The patterns do not repeat unnaturally, and there are faint reflections of the dancers and chandeliers on the glossy surface, indicating proper lighting interaction. The chandeliers are elaborate, multi-tiered structures with numerous crystal prisms and candle-like bulbs. Each crystal element is distinct and refracts light realistically, contributing to a warm glow that diffuses softly throughout the room. The overall structure of the chandeliers is symmetrical and proportionate, consistent with historical designs seen in palatial ballrooms. There are no signs of clipping, misalignment, or artificial lighting artifacts, reinforcing the impression of photorealistic rendering.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the shadows cast by the dancers soft and directional, consistent with overhead chandeliers, and do they blend smoothly into the surrounding environment without sharp boundaries?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows beneath the dancers in Image B are soft-edged and elongated slightly toward the back, consistent with light sources positioned above and behind them—specifically the chandeliers. The directionality matches the placement of the overhead lights, with gradual falloff from dark to light, indicating diffuse illumination rather than harsh direct lighting. The shadow edges are blurred and merge seamlessly with the marble floor, avoiding any hard lines or unnatural cutoffs. This smooth blending suggests accurate global illumination modeling, where ambient occlusion and indirect light contribute to realistic shading. Such effects are typical in high-end digital compositing or cinematic rendering, supporting the conclusion that the lighting is both plausible and artistically consistent with the scene.",

      "question": "Do both dancers' hands show five fingers each with natural joint alignment, smooth skin texture, and no overlapping or missing digits at the point of contact?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the hands in Image B, both dancers’ hands display five distinct fingers with anatomically correct proportions and joint articulation. The fingers are properly aligned, with knuckles and phalanges following natural human hand structure. At the point of contact—where the man’s hand grips the woman’s arm and her hand rests on his shoulder—the digits interlock realistically without any overlapping, clipping, or missing fingers. Skin texture appears smooth and consistent with lighting, showing subtle highlights and shadows that enhance realism. There is no evidence of digital artifacts such as floating fingers or distorted joints. The positioning reflects a choreographed dance hold, maintaining physical plausibility and fine detail in facial and limb anatomy.",
