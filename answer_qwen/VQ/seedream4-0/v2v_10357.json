      "question": "Are the shapes of the teddy bear and motorcycle still recognizable after being converted to a low-poly 3-D render style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the teddy bear and motorcycle have been rendered in a low-poly 3-D style. Despite this stylistic change, the basic shapes of both objects are still recognizable. The teddy bear retains its general form with distinguishable features like the head, arms, and legs. Similarly, the motorcycle's key components such as the wheels, handlebars, and engine are identifiable. This conclusion is drawn by observing the overall structure and comparing it to common knowledge of what these objects typically look like.",

      "question": "Do the surfaces of the teddy bear and motorcycle retain their texture details without appearing overly simplified or losing important features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The surfaces of the teddy bear and motorcycle in Image B appear simplified due to the low-poly style, which inherently reduces texture details. However, they do not lose important features that define their identity. For instance, the teddy bear's fur texture is absent, but its soft toy characteristics are conveyed through shape and color. The motorcycle's metallic parts are less detailed but still recognizable. Comparing with Image A, where textures are more realistic, Image B simplifies them while retaining essential features.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the teddy bear and motorcycle consistent with their real-world counterparts, avoiding any distortion or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions of the teddy bear and motorcycle in Image B seem consistent with real-world expectations. The teddy bear is appropriately sized relative to the motorcycle, and the motorcycle maintains realistic proportions for its components. There is no noticeable distortion or unrealistic scaling that would make the objects appear out of proportion. This analysis is based on comparing the relative sizes and shapes against typical real-world objects.",

      "question": "Does the teddy bear appear naturally seated on the motorcycle, maintaining a believable posture and interaction with the vehicle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teddy bear in Image B appears naturally seated on the motorcycle, maintaining a believable posture. Its limbs are positioned in a way that suggests it is holding onto the handlebars and sitting comfortably. This interaction seems logical and consistent with how one might imagine a teddy bear riding a motorcycle. Comparing with Image A, the posture remains similar, reinforcing the naturalness of the pose.",

      "question": "Is the scenic background seamlessly integrated with the low-poly 3-D rendered teddy bear and motorcycle, without any visible artifacts or inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The scenic background in Image B is integrated with the low-poly 3-D rendered teddy bear and motorcycle without visible artifacts or inconsistencies. The background elements like the mountain and sky complement the foreground objects seamlessly. The transition between the stylized foreground and the more realistic background does not disrupt the visual coherence. This integration is effective because the background is slightly blurred, which helps in blending with the stylized elements.",
