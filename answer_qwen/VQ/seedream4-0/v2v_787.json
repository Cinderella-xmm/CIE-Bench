      "question": "Does the 3D character's face retain the original facial details and proportions without introducing unnatural distortions or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the 3D character's face is stylized in a chibi-like cartoon aesthetic, which inherently involves exaggerated features such as large eyes, simplified nose and mouth, and a rounded head shape. These are not realistic proportions but are common in animated or toy-like representations. While the character's facial features are consistent with the overall artistic style—such as the placement of the eyes, eyebrows, and smile—they do not preserve the naturalistic facial proportions seen in real humans. The eyes are disproportionately large relative to the face, and the cheeks are smooth and rounded, lacking fine detail like pores or subtle shadows. This is intentional for a cartoon design, but it does introduce distortions compared to real human anatomy. Therefore, while the face is coherent within its stylistic framework, it does not retain the original facial details or proportions from a realistic standpoint.",

      "question": "Are the chibi-like long-legged proportions of the 3D character visually plausible and structurally coherent, avoiding unnatural geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D character in Image B exhibits a chibi-style design characterized by an oversized head and extremely elongated legs. While this is a common trope in anime and stylized digital art, the leg-to-body ratio appears exaggerated beyond typical anatomical plausibility. The legs are disproportionately long compared to the torso and head, creating a sense of imbalance that could be considered unnatural if judged by real-world human proportions. However, within the context of stylized cartoon or toy aesthetics (like those seen in figurines or animated characters), such proportions are acceptable and even expected. The limbs are smoothly modeled without visible geometric glitches or rendering artifacts, suggesting structural coherence within the intended artistic style. Thus, although not anatomically accurate, the proportions are visually coherent and consistent with chibi design principles.",

      "question": "Do the outfit and accessories of the 3D character incorporate the green and burnt orange hues naturally, avoiding unnatural textures and loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outfit and accessories in Image B feature a coordinated color scheme of green and burnt orange, which directly mirrors the colors worn by the woman in Image A. The 3D character wears an orange shirt, green overalls, and matching shoes with both colors. The textures appear smooth and consistent, with no visible pixelation, shading errors, or material inconsistencies. The fabric of the clothing has subtle folds and creases that suggest volume and realism appropriate for a 3D-rendered model. The accessories, including the hat and shoes, maintain clean edges and uniform color application. There is no evidence of texture warping or loss of detail; instead, the materials look polished and professionally rendered. Given that the colors are applied uniformly and the surfaces are free of visual artifacts, the integration of these hues is natural and well-executed within the digital medium.",

      "question": "Are the fashion-forward accessories like glasses, a tablet or sketchbook, and footwear integrated seamlessly into the 3D character, maintaining overall authenticity and natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 3D character in Image B is equipped with several accessories: black-rimmed glasses, a gray tablet or sketchbook, and two-tone boots. The glasses are proportionally sized and positioned correctly on the face, fitting the cartoonish style without appearing misaligned or distorted. The tablet is held naturally in one hand, with fingers wrapped around it in a believable pose, suggesting functional use rather than being merely attached. The footwear, featuring a combination of green and burnt orange, matches the outfit’s color palette and is modeled with proper lacing and sole structure. All accessories are aligned with the character’s body and scale appropriately, indicating careful attention to design consistency. Although stylized, they do not appear glued-on or disjointed from the character. Their integration supports the narrative of a modern, fashion-conscious individual, enhancing the character’s authenticity within the playful, illustrative context.",

      "question": "Does the solid background color complement and highlight the 3D character's overall color scheme without introducing any distracting artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a neutral beige tone, which serves as a clean, unobtrusive backdrop. This choice allows the vibrant green and burnt orange colors of the character’s outfit to stand out clearly without competing for attention. The absence of patterns, gradients, or shadows ensures that the focus remains on the character and the displayed clothing items. There are no visible artifacts such as noise, banding, or sharp edges that might detract from the image quality. The lighting appears even across the scene, further enhancing visibility and depth. The simplicity of the background complements the character’s design and reinforces the fashion-forward theme of the 'OOTD' (Outfit of the Day) layout. Thus, the background effectively highlights the subject without distraction.",
