    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Does the creature added to the image appear naturally integrated with the temple and surrounding jungle, without any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature in Image B is designed with a texture that mimics the stone of the temple, suggesting it is part of the structure. The blending of its form with the temple's architecture and the surrounding foliage creates an illusion of natural integration. There are no visible artifacts or unnatural textures that disrupt this effect. The creature's design seems to flow seamlessly from the temple steps, enhancing the scene's coherence.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the creature's design reflect the temple's shape and textures accurately, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding distorted geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The creature's design incorporates elements that closely resemble the temple's blocky, layered structure and stone texture. Its limbs and body parts align with the temple's geometry, ensuring structural coherence. There are no distorted shapes; instead, the creature appears as an extension of the temple, reinforcing the visual harmony between the two.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the custom-designed orb or capsule at the creature's feet visually consistent with the temple's architectural details and natural elements, without introducing unnatural textures or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The orb at the creature's feet features intricate patterns that complement the temple's aesthetic. It maintains a level of detail that matches the surrounding environment, neither introducing unnatural textures nor losing fine details. The orb's design integrates well with the scene, contributing to the overall artistic consistency.",

      "question": "Does the addition of the creature and the custom-designed orb maintain the scene's overall authenticity and natural appearance, without disrupting the harmony of the jungle and temple setting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The additions of the creature and the orb enhance rather than disrupt the scene's authenticity. The creature's design blends with the temple, while the orb adds an element that feels like a natural artifact within the setting. Both elements contribute to the scene's thematic unity, preserving the harmony between the jungle and the temple.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the creature's invented name and elemental type displayed clearly beside or beneath it, without interfering with the visual quality or introducing any distracting elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text displaying the creature's name and elemental type is positioned below the creature and orb, written in a clear and legible font. It does not interfere with the visual quality of the image or introduce distracting elements. Instead, it provides context that enhances the viewer's understanding of the scene.",
