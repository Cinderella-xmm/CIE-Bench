      "question": "Do the clothing materials on both individuals display natural fabric textures consistent with denim and woven southwestern textiles, without visible artifacts or inconsistent shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the individual on the left wears a white jacket with colorful, geometric patterns along the shoulders and sleeves—characteristic of traditional Southwestern or Native American-inspired woven textiles. These patterns are rendered with clear, defined lines and color gradients that mimic real textile weaving, suggesting authenticity in design. The underlying shirt appears to be denim, which is evident from its blue color and texture resembling typical denim fabric. The individual on the right wears a light-wash denim jacket, which displays subtle variations in tone and texture consistent with real denim material. There are no obvious digital artifacts such as pixelation, unnatural edges, or inconsistent shading that would suggest poor editing. The lighting across both garments is uniform and matches the ambient light of the scene, further supporting the realism of the materials.",

      "question": "Are the cacti silhouettes and setting sun elements blended naturally into the wooden background without causing misalignment, unnatural shadows, or color inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cacti silhouettes and the stylized setting sun are placed above the wooden plank background, forming a desert-themed backdrop. The cacti are black silhouettes against a warm yellow-orange sky, which is visually consistent with a sunset scene. However, upon closer inspection, the transition between the sky and the wooden wall lacks depth or shadowing that would make the elements appear layered naturally. The cacti and sun seem to be overlaid digitally without soft blending at their edges, resulting in a slightly flat appearance. Additionally, there are no shadows cast by the cacti onto the wooden planks, which would be expected if they were part of a 3D environment. This absence of shadowing and lack of gradient blending suggests an artificial integration rather than a seamless blend. While the colors are thematically appropriate, the overall composition feels like a graphic overlay rather than a cohesive scene.",

      "question": "Does the new band name text in the banner use a distressed font style that appears handcrafted and consistent with the western theme, without jagged edges or unnatural texture application?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE' in the lower banner uses a bold, uppercase font with a distressed, weathered appearance. The letters have irregular edges and slight chipping effects, giving them a worn, rustic look that aligns well with a western or country music aesthetic. The texture applied to the text resembles aged paint or metal signage, which is commonly used in cowboy-themed branding. There are no visible jagged edges or unnatural distortions; instead, the distressing appears intentional and evenly distributed. The font choice and texture application are consistent with visual themes seen in country music posters and album art, reinforcing authenticity within the genre's stylistic norms.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are any newly added cowboy boots or hats positioned with correct proportions and perspective relative to the individuals and background, without appearing distorted or detached from the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Two cowboy boots are added to the bottom corners of the image—one on each side—and a second hat is placed near the right individual’s shoulder. The boots are proportionally accurate to real cowboy boots and are angled appropriately to suggest placement on the ground. Their position creates a sense of symmetry and balance in the frame. The boot on the right appears slightly larger due to perspective, but this is consistent with foreshortening and does not indicate distortion. The hat on the right side is smaller and tilted, matching the size and style of the one worn by the person on the left, suggesting it was placed as a decorative element. There are no signs of warping, clipping, or unnatural shadows that would suggest poor compositing. The objects appear grounded and integrated into the scene despite being added post-production.",

      "question": "Is the overall layout of the edited image balanced, with all added elements (text, props, background details) properly aligned and spaced to avoid visual clutter or imbalance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of Image B is carefully arranged to maintain visual harmony. The two individuals are centered, creating a focal point. The added desert-themed background elements (cacti, sunset) are symmetrically placed above the wooden wall, contributing to a thematic consistency without overwhelming the subjects. The cowboy boots at the bottom corners anchor the image and add symmetry, while the text banner sits cleanly below, ensuring readability and balance. Although the cacti and sun appear somewhat flat, their placement does not disrupt the flow of the image. The spacing between elements is even, and there is no overcrowding. The color palette—warm yellows, browns, and blues—complements the western theme and enhances cohesion. Despite minor issues with layering (e.g., lack of shadow), the layout remains balanced and aesthetically pleasing.",
