      "question": "Are the eyes of the woman and child enlarged but still aligned with their facial structures without visible distortion or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the woman and the child have large, expressive eyes characteristic of anime or watercolor-style illustrations. The eyes are significantly larger than typical human proportions, which is a common stylistic choice in animated or illustrated art to convey emotion and focus. However, despite their enlargement, the eyes remain symmetrically placed within the facial structure, maintaining alignment with the eyebrows, nose, and mouth. There is no visible distortion in the spacing between facial features—such as the distance from the eyes to the nose or ears—and the overall facial proportions appear consistent with the artistic style. This suggests that while stylized, the eyes are not unnaturally spaced or misaligned. In contrast, Image A (the original photo) shows realistic human proportions where eyes are smaller and more proportionate to the face. The transformation in Image B follows an intentional artistic exaggeration, not a technical error. Therefore, the eyes are enlarged but remain properly aligned.",

      "question": "Do the hands of the woman and child show five fingers each, with natural finger curvature and no overlapping or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the woman and the child have hands depicted with five distinct fingers. The fingers exhibit gentle curvature consistent with natural hand anatomy, and there are no visible overlaps or missing digits. The positioning of the hands—especially the woman’s right hand reaching toward the child—shows clear separation between fingers, with slight bending at the joints, which reflects anatomical accuracy within the stylized drawing. While the illustration is simplified compared to photorealism, it retains enough detail to confirm the presence of all five fingers on each hand. Comparing this to Image A, the original photograph clearly shows five fingers per hand with natural curvature and spacing. The edited version preserves this detail in a cartoonish yet accurate manner, indicating that the artist maintained proper digit count and form. Thus, the hands in Image B are anatomically plausible within the artistic context.",

      "question": "Are the color transitions across the woman’s dress, the child’s dress, and the background flowers smooth and free of sharp digital edges or unnatural blotches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a watercolor painting style, evident from the soft blending of colors and the subtle gradations in hue and saturation. The woman's red-orange jacket and white skirt show smooth transitions between tones, with no abrupt lines or harsh digital artifacts. Similarly, the child’s green patterned dress has delicate shading that mimics the flow of watercolor paint. The background flowers display varied hues—pinks, purples, oranges—that blend naturally into one another, resembling organic pigmentation rather than digitally applied blocks of color. There are no visible jagged edges or pixelated areas, which would suggest poor rendering. Instead, the brushstroke-like textures and diffusion of color indicate careful artistic execution. When compared to Image A, which has photographic realism with defined edges and sharp contrasts, Image B deliberately uses softer visual techniques. The absence of digital artifacts confirms that the color transitions are smooth and consistent with the intended artistic medium.",

      "question": "Are the added floral accents in the background consistent in size, lighting, and texture with the existing flowers and do they cast plausible shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, small floral accents are present in the upper corners and lower-right edge of the composition. These include pink roses and daisy-like blooms. Their size is proportionally smaller than the main flower beds in the midground, which is reasonable given their placement as decorative elements. The lighting on these added flowers matches the overall warm, diffused daylight illuminating the scene—consistent with the ambient light on the house and trees. Texture-wise, the petals and leaves follow the same watercolor technique used throughout the image, with translucent washes and faint outlines. However, upon closer inspection, these accent flowers lack distinct shadows beneath them, which would be expected if they were physically present in the foreground. Additionally, their placement appears slightly detached from the depth cues of the environment—they float above the frame border rather than being integrated into the garden space. This suggests they may be symbolic or illustrative additions rather than realistically rendered objects. Compared to Image A, where all flowers are grounded and part of the real-world setting, the added flowers in Image B serve a decorative purpose and are not fully integrated into the spatial logic. While they match in style and lighting, they do not cast plausible shadows, making their integration less convincing.",

      "question": "Does the wooden border have uniform thickness, natural wood grain, and proper alignment with the image edges without gaps or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden frame surrounding Image B is depicted with a consistent width along all four sides, suggesting uniform thickness. The texture includes visible wood grain patterns that run vertically and horizontally, simulating natural timber. The color variation within the frame—ranging from light to dark brown—adds depth and realism, resembling actual wood. There are no noticeable gaps between the frame and the artwork, nor any signs of warping or misalignment. The corners are clean and meet at precise right angles, indicating careful construction. While this is a painted representation of a frame (not a physical object), the details are rendered with sufficient precision to appear authentic. In comparison to Image A, which lacks any frame, the addition of the wooden border in Image B serves as a stylistic enhancement that complements the watercolor aesthetic. The frame’s design is coherent with its purpose as a decorative element, and no visual flaws compromise its appearance.",
