      "question": "Does the background with organic, curvilinear patterns complement the main elements without causing any visual clutter or unnatural disruptions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background with organic, curvilinear patterns complements the main elements without causing any visual clutter or unnatural disruptions. The background patterns enhance the Art Nouveau style by providing a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing backdrop that supports the central figures. The absence of conflicting elements ensures that the viewer's attention remains focused on the main subjects while still appreciating the intricate details of the background. This conclusion is reached through an assessment of the balance between the background and foreground elements.",

      "question": "Is the 'SHOP NOW' button clearly visible yet delicately integrated into the Art Nouveau design without appearing jarring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'SHOP NOW' button is clearly visible yet delicately integrated into the Art Nouveau design. Its placement and color contrast make it noticeable, but its design elements, such as rounded corners and soft edges, blend well with the overall style. It does not appear jarring because it respects the fluidity and elegance of the surrounding motifs. Comparing this to Image A, where the button was more modern and less integrated, the new design in Image B successfully merges functionality with artistic integrity.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The proportions and shapes of the DVD case and CD are consistent and visually credible within the new Art Nouveau style. The DVD case retains its rectangular shape while incorporating decorative elements that match the style, and the CD's circular form is enhanced with Art Nouveau-inspired patterns. Both items maintain their functional appearance while fitting seamlessly into the artistic theme. This conclusion is derived from analyzing how the objects adhere to both practical and stylistic requirements.",
