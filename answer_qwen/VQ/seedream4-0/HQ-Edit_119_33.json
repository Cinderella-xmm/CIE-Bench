      "question": "Do the stylized sunflowers in the background have smooth, continuous curves without broken or fragmented petal edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sunflowers in the background are rendered in a highly stylized Art Nouveau aesthetic. The petals are composed of clean, flowing lines with consistent curvature and no visible breaks or jagged edges. Each petal follows a smooth arc, contributing to an ornamental, decorative quality typical of Art Nouveau design. This style emphasizes organic forms and fluidity, which is evident in the seamless transitions between petal segments. There are no signs of fragmentation or pixelation; instead, the edges are clearly defined and harmonious. Based on visual inspection and knowledge of Art Nouveau art principles—where natural elements are abstracted into elegant, uninterrupted lines—it is clear that the sunflower petals maintain continuity. Comparing this to Image A (the original), where sunflowers appear more realistic with subtle textural variations, Image B's version is intentionally simplified yet maintains smoothness. Therefore, the stylized sunflowers in Image B do not exhibit broken or fragmented edges.",

      "question": "Are the braids in the hair seamlessly transformed into flowing Art Nouveau swirls without visible gaps, stretched strands, or disconnected sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the braids in the woman’s hair are not depicted as literal, physical braids but are artistically reinterpreted into swirling, spiral patterns characteristic of Art Nouveau. These spirals extend from the base of the braids and flow outward in a continuous, rhythmic fashion. The transformation appears intentional and stylistic rather than anatomical, with no visible gaps or abrupt transitions between individual strands. The lines are uniform in thickness and curvature, forming cohesive, interconnected loops that mimic the organic movement found in Art Nouveau designs. There is no evidence of stretched or distorted sections—each braid morphs smoothly into the next curve. In contrast, Image A shows realistic, tightly woven braids with distinct separation and texture. The transformation in Image B is a deliberate artistic choice to integrate the hair into the overall decorative theme. Thus, the braids are successfully integrated into flowing swirls without visual discontinuities.",

      "question": "Does the dress display smooth, flowing patterns that follow the contours of the body without abrupt angles or unnatural fabric tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dress in Image B features stylized, swirling patterns that align with the Art Nouveau aesthetic. These patterns follow the natural curves of the woman’s shoulders, chest, and torso, creating a sense of fluid motion. The lines of the dress appear to drape naturally, with no sharp angles or rigid folds that would suggest unnatural tension. Instead, the fabric seems to ripple and undulate in harmony with the body’s form, using curved, spiral motifs that enhance the organic feel. The transition from one section of the dress to another is seamless, with no abrupt changes in direction or texture. When compared to Image A, where the dress has a more realistic, soft fabric appearance with subtle shadows and natural creases, Image B’s version is more abstract but still adheres to the body’s shape through continuous, flowing lines. The stylization does not compromise the illusion of fit or comfort; it enhances it through decorative continuity. Therefore, the dress exhibits smooth, flowing patterns that conform to the body’s contours.",

      "question": "Are the Art Nouveau patterns in the hair, dress, and background unified in line style, color palette, and scale, creating a cohesive visual composition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B demonstrates a strong thematic consistency across all elements. The Art Nouveau patterns in the hair, dress, and background share similar characteristics: they use curvilinear lines, spiral motifs, and floral inspirations. The line style is uniform—thin, elegant, and continuous—across all components. The color palette is dominated by golden yellows, warm browns, and soft greens, which are harmoniously distributed throughout the image, reinforcing a unified visual tone. The scale of the patterns also matches: the swirls in the hair are proportionally similar to those in the dress and background, ensuring visual balance. The background features stylized sunflowers with spiral centers that echo the spirals in the braids and dress, creating a recursive, integrated design. This level of cohesion reflects the core principles of Art Nouveau, where every element contributes to a holistic, decorative whole. In comparison, Image A lacks such deliberate pattern integration, featuring naturalistic details without stylization. Thus, Image B achieves a high degree of unity in style, color, and scale.",

      "question": "Are the fine details in the sunflower centers, hair braids, and facial features preserved and clearly defined, without noticeable blurring or artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the stylized nature of the artwork, the fine details remain well-defined. The centers of the sunflowers feature intricate spiral patterns with clear delineation between concentric rings, showing no signs of blurring or digital artifacts. Similarly, the hair braids, though transformed into Art Nouveau swirls, retain crisp edges and consistent line weight, indicating careful rendering. Facial features such as the eyes, lips, and eyebrows are sharply outlined and detailed, with no visible pixelation or distortion. Even the smallest elements, like the earring and the tiny flowers in the hair, are clearly visible and properly integrated into the design. While the style is illustrative rather than photorealistic, the clarity of each component suggests high-resolution execution. Compared to Image A, which presents more natural textures and subtle gradients, Image B uses bold outlines and flat colors but maintains precision in detail. There is no evidence of compression artifacts or smudging, confirming that the details are preserved.",
