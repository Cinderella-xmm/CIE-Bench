    "Question": "Q1: Does the mosaic pattern on the saree maintain uniform tesserae size and alignment across the fabric, with no visible seams or distorted tiles?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the saree is rendered in a mosaic style, composed of small, square-like tesserae. Upon close inspection, the tesserae appear to be uniformly sized and aligned across the fabric surface, especially in areas such as the border and floral patterns. The transitions between colors are smooth within the mosaic format, suggesting careful placement of individual tiles. There are no visible seams or distortions that would suggest misalignment or irregularities in tile placement. The consistent repetition of tile shapes and sizes across the entire garment supports the conclusion that the mosaic rendering maintains structural integrity. This uniformity is typical of high-quality mosaic art, where precision in tile placement is essential for aesthetic coherence.",

    "Question": "Q2: Are the arches and dome of the transformed building structurally coherent, with straight edges, consistent curvature, and no broken or misaligned geometry?",
    "explanation": "The background structure in Image B depicts the Taj Mahal rendered in a mosaic style. Despite the artistic transformation, the architectural elements—such as the central dome, minarets, and arched gateways—are still recognizable. The dome exhibits a consistent curvature, and the arches maintain symmetrical proportions. However, due to the mosaic technique, some edges appear slightly pixelated or fragmented, which may give an impression of minor geometric distortion. Yet, these effects are stylistic rather than structural flaws. The overall composition preserves the intended symmetry and architectural coherence of the Taj Mahal, even if the details are stylized. Thus, while not photorealistic, the representation remains structurally sound in terms of form and proportion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do both hands show five fingers each, with natural finger spacing and joint alignment, and no extra digits or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, both women have their hands positioned in front of them, resting near the waist. Each hand clearly displays five fingers with distinct separation and natural joint articulation. The fingers are proportionally spaced, and there is no indication of extra digits or abnormal curvature. The mosaic rendering does not obscure the anatomical details; instead, it uses tile patterns to approximate the shape of the hands without distorting the number or positioning of fingers. Even under the stylized medium, the human anatomy remains faithful to biological norms. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of human anatomy, the hands appear correctly formed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the floral motifs evenly distributed and proportionally sized relative to the surrounding architecture, without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "The floral motifs in Image B are integrated into the mosaic background, appearing along the lower left and upper right corners. These flowers are depicted with peacock feathers and petals, rendered in tile form. They are placed at the periphery of the image and do not intrude upon the main architectural elements like the Taj Mahal or the figures. Their size is proportionate to the scale of the scene—neither too large nor too small—and they do not overlap with key structures or characters in a way that disrupts spatial logic. The arrangement follows a balanced compositional rule, common in decorative mosaics, where symbolic flora complements rather than competes with the central subjects. Thus, the floral elements are well-integrated and spatially coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the golden backdrop exhibit smooth gradient transitions and subtle surface variations, without abrupt color shifts or unnatural shine?",
    "explanation": "The golden backdrop in Image B is composed of numerous small mosaic tiles in varying shades of gold, yellow, and amber. While the overall effect is rich and luminous, the transition between colors is not smooth but rather stepwise due to the discrete nature of the tesserae. However, this is consistent with traditional mosaic techniques, where gradation is achieved through careful selection and placement of colored tiles rather than continuous gradients. There are no abrupt color shifts that violate the expected tonal progression in such artwork. The 'shine' appears to be simulated through reflective tile finishes, which is plausible in mosaic art. The surface variation is intentional and enhances texture, not detracts from realism. Therefore, although not a photographic gradient, the effect is artistically appropriate and natural within the context of mosaic art.",
    "answer": "Yes"
