      "question": "Are the lines forming the chevron pattern on the front panel evenly spaced, angularly consistent, and free from jagged edges or irregularities that suggest distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chevron pattern on the front panel of the bag appears to be rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner rather than a photorealistic one. The lines forming the chevrons are drawn with consistent angles and spacing, maintaining a symmetrical zigzag structure. However, upon closer inspection, the edges of the lines appear slightly uneven and not perfectly smooth, suggesting digital rendering artifacts or intentional stylistic simplification. In real-world materials like quilted fabric, such patterns would typically have precise stitching and uniformity. Here, the slight variations in line thickness and minor inconsistencies in the sharpness of the angles indicate potential digital distortion or low-resolution vector art. While the overall design is coherent, the lack of crispness and subtle irregularities suggest it is not perfectly even or angularly consistent.",

      "question": "Do the gold zippers retain their linear definition and proper placement along the seams, with no misalignment or broken segments suggesting artifacting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold zippers in Image B are depicted as thin, continuous lines running along the seams of the bag. They appear to follow the intended path of the zippers on the front pocket and side compartments. However, the representation is simplified and lacks fine detail—such as individual teeth or texture—that would be present in a realistic depiction. Notably, the zipper pull tabs and ends do not show clear continuity; some segments appear slightly disconnected or overly smoothed, especially near the corners of the front pocket. This could be due to vector-based rendering limitations or compression artifacts. Additionally, the zippers seem to lack depth and dimensionality compared to how they would appear in a physical product. While the general alignment is correct, the absence of fine details and minor breaks in line continuity suggest digital artifacting.",

      "question": "Is the olive tone applied uniformly across the surface of the bag, with no patchy areas, color bleeding, or inconsistent saturation that suggests digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The olive green color of the bag in Image B is generally consistent in hue across the surface. However, there are subtle variations in saturation and brightness, particularly around the edges and in shadowed regions of the illustration. These differences may stem from shading techniques used to simulate depth, but they also resemble digital noise or gradient banding often seen in low-resolution or poorly rendered graphics. Additionally, the transition between the main body and the black trim shows slight color bleed at the borders, where the olive tone appears to fade into the adjacent black area. This is not typical of real-world dye application but rather indicative of poor layer blending in digital editing. Therefore, while the overall tone is close to uniform, the presence of these visual imperfections suggests inconsistency likely due to digital artifacts.",

      "question": "Is the blank message area on the back of the postcard aligned with the dimensions of the front design, with straight edges and no visible warping or layering errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a postcard-like object inside a black portfolio. The front of the postcard displays an illustrated version of the bag, and the back side appears to be plain white with a small square in the upper right corner, resembling a space for a stamp. The edges of this white area are mostly straight and aligned with the outer frame of the postcard. There is no visible warping or curvature that would suggest misalignment. The layers appear flat and properly stacked, with clean margins and no overlapping or gaps that would indicate layering errors. The proportions of the blank area match what one would expect from a standard postcard format, and the alignment with the front design seems consistent. Given that the postcard is presented as a two-dimensional graphic within a frame, the lack of distortion supports the conclusion that the layout is well-maintained.",

      "question": "Does the black portfolio contain the postcard with proper depth and alignment, showing no clipping, shadow mismatches, or unnatural gaps between the postcard and the portfolio walls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black portfolio in Image B appears to be a rectangular box with a lid partially open, revealing the postcard inside. The postcard is centered within the interior space, and its edges align neatly with the inner walls of the portfolio. There are no visible gaps or clipping issues—meaning the postcard does not extend beyond the boundaries of the portfolio nor appear cut off. Shadows cast by the portfolio’s lid and sides are soft and consistent with overhead lighting, suggesting a plausible three-dimensional setup. However, the depth perception is minimal, and the rendering lacks realistic perspective or depth cues such as parallax or material texture. Despite this, there are no obvious shadow mismatches or unnatural spacing that would suggest improper alignment. The overall composition appears deliberate and balanced, indicating careful digital placement.",
