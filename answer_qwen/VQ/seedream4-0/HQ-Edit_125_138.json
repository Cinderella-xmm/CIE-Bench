      "question": "Are the golden batik patterns on the dancer's dress clearly defined, continuous, and free from pixelation or jagged edges that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer’s dress features intricate golden batik-like patterns overlaid on a red-orange fabric. The patterns are rendered in a stylized, illustrative manner consistent with line art and color fills typical of graphic design. Upon close inspection, the patterns appear smooth and continuous, with no visible pixelation or jagged edges—common indicators of low-resolution rendering or poor digital editing. The lines defining the batik motifs are clean and well-integrated into the fabric texture, suggesting high-quality vector-based or digitally enhanced artwork. Given that this is an artistic interpretation rather than a photograph, some stylization is expected, but there is no evidence of digital artifacts such as aliasing or blurring. Therefore, the patterns meet the criteria for clarity and continuity.",

      "question": "Does the line-drawn version of the temple maintain accurate tier alignment and structural symmetry without missing or distorted roof layers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The temple in Image B is depicted as a detailed line drawing, reminiscent of architectural sketches or technical illustrations. The structure features multiple tiers, each progressively smaller toward the top, characteristic of Balinese temples (e.g., Pura Besakih). The alignment of these tiers appears consistent and symmetrical along the central vertical axis. Each roof layer is clearly delineated, and there are no visible omissions or distortions in the stacking pattern. The symmetry is preserved, with balanced overhangs and decorative elements mirrored on both sides. While the style is simplified compared to a photorealistic rendering, the essential architectural integrity remains intact. This suggests careful drafting and attention to proportion, ensuring that the temple’s iconic form is accurately represented in line art form.",

      "question": "Are the two guardian statues on either side of the pathway identical in size, pose, and position relative to the central temple axis?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the two guardian statues flank the central pathway leading to the temple. Both statues are illustrated in a similar ornate style, featuring fierce faces, raised arms, and elaborate headdresses. They appear to be mirror images of each other in terms of pose and orientation—one facing left, the other right—consistent with traditional Balinese gate guardians (such as Barong or Raksasa figures). Their sizes are visually comparable, and their positions are symmetrically placed relative to the central axis of the temple. There is no noticeable difference in scale or posture that would suggest asymmetry. Although minor artistic liberties may exist in detailing, the overall balance and mirroring suggest intentional symmetry in design. Thus, they are effectively identical in size, pose, and placement.",

      "question": "Do both of the dancer’s hands show five fingers each with natural spacing, smooth contours, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dancer in Image B is shown in a graceful pose with one hand extended forward and the other raised near her head. Upon examining both hands, the fingers are clearly defined and countable—each hand displays five distinct fingers. The spacing between fingers appears natural, and the contours are smooth, without any signs of distortion, fusion, or additional digits. The illustration style uses clean lines and proportional anatomy, consistent with human figure drawing conventions. There are no visual anomalies such as missing fingers or unnatural bends. Even though the image is stylized, the representation of the hands adheres to anatomical accuracy within the artistic context.",

      "question": "Is the text positioned in a way that does not overlap or obscure the dancer, temple, or guardian statues, and is it clearly readable without visual clutter?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text in Image B includes the title 'Bali’s Majestic Legacy' at the top center, with descriptive paragraphs labeled 'Balatine Dance' and 'Balang Dange' positioned on the left and right sides respectively. These texts are placed in margins outside the central composition, avoiding direct overlap with the dancer, temple, or guardian statues. The font is legible and spaced appropriately, with sufficient contrast against the light background. The layout ensures that key visual elements remain unobscured while providing informative content. Additionally, floral motifs frame the text subtly without adding clutter. Overall, the text placement is thoughtful and respectful of the visual hierarchy, maintaining readability and aesthetic balance.",
