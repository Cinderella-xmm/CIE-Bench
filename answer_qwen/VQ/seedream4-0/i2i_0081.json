      "question": "Do the neon lighting effects seamlessly integrate with the mirror reflection, avoiding any artifacts or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mirror reflects the surrounding environment, including the vibrant neon lighting. The reflections show a smooth gradient of pink and blue hues that align with the ambient lighting on the walls. The reflection in the mirror appears consistent with the color scheme and intensity of the actual light sources, suggesting that the lighting is evenly distributed and realistically mirrored. There are no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or inconsistencies in the reflection that would indicate digital artifacts. Furthermore, the mirror's surface shows subtle distortions typical of real glass surfaces under colored lighting, which adds to the visual credibility. This seamless integration implies that the neon lights were applied in a way that respects optical physics—light entering the mirror at various angles creates a coherent reflection without breaking realism. Thus, based on the visual cues and principles of light reflection, the neon effects appear well-integrated.",

      "question": "Does the gradient background complement the sink area geometry, maintaining structural coherence and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gradient background in Image B transitions smoothly from pink to blue across the wall, wrapping around the mirror and sink area. The sink unit itself maintains sharp, clean lines and symmetrical proportions, consistent with its design in the original image. The lighting enhances the contours of the cabinet and countertop without distorting their shape or creating false edges. There is no evidence of warping, stretching, or misalignment between the sink’s geometry and the background gradient. The gradient serves as an atmospheric effect rather than a disruptive one, preserving the spatial integrity of the scene. From a design perspective, such gradients are commonly used in vaporwave aesthetics to create depth and mood without altering physical structure. Since the sink remains geometrically intact and the gradient flows naturally around it, there is no break in structural coherence.",

      "question": "Are the materials and textures of the black cabinet visually credible, retaining fine details and avoiding unnatural changes after applying the vaporwave style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black cabinet in Image B retains a matte finish with subtle reflections that suggest a non-glossy material like painted MDF or laminate. Despite the intense neon lighting, the surface does not exhibit excessive sheen or specular highlights that would be inconsistent with such a material. Instead, the light interacts with the cabinet in a way that suggests diffuse reflection—soft glows along the edges but no over-saturation or artificial shine. Fine details such as the handle cutouts and panel divisions remain sharp and unaltered. The vaporwave aesthetic often involves high-contrast lighting and saturated colors, but here, the cabinet’s texture has not been distorted into a plastic-like or overly reflective state. It still appears solid and grounded in reality, even under stylized lighting. Therefore, the material representation remains plausible and detailed.",

      "question": "Have the faucet and soap dispenser area retained their natural appearance without any loss of detail or introduction of artifacts during the vaporwave style conversion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The faucet and soap dispenser in Image B maintain their original form and proportions. Both fixtures are rendered with clear outlines and consistent shading, showing no signs of blurring, pixelation, or deformation. The black finish of the hardware contrasts well against the white sink and colorful background, yet the transition between materials is smooth and physically accurate. There is no visible distortion in the spout or pump mechanism, nor are there any floating pixels or unnatural shadows that might suggest digital manipulation errors. The lighting affects these objects realistically—casting soft glows and subtle highlights that follow the direction of the ambient neon light. Given that vaporwave styles can sometimes exaggerate elements, the fact that these functional components remain precise and undistorted indicates careful rendering. Their natural appearance is preserved despite the stylistic overhaul.",

      "question": "Do the placements of neon lighting effects around the mirror and sink area preserve visual plausibility, ensuring physical rationality and absence of distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon lighting in Image B is positioned above and below the mirror, emitting warm orange and cool purple tones respectively. These lights appear to originate from within or behind the mirror frame, casting consistent illumination on the surrounding wall and sink. The glow spreads outward in a manner consistent with real LED strip lighting—gradually fading and diffusing without sharp cutoffs or abrupt transitions. The light wraps around the edges of the mirror and cabinet in a physically plausible way, respecting the three-dimensional structure of the space. There is no evidence of floating light sources, incorrect shadow directions, or overlapping beams that defy logic. Additionally, the interplay between the top and bottom lights creates a balanced ambiance without causing visual clutter or distortion. This setup adheres to common practices in modern bathroom lighting design, where indirect lighting enhances mood while maintaining spatial clarity. Hence, the placement of the neon effects is both aesthetically intentional and physically rational.",
