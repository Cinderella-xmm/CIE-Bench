      "question": "Are the bee and flower figures in the 3D-rendered collectibles free from any unnatural distortions or broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bee and flower figures are rendered with smooth, clean edges and symmetrical forms. The bee’s body segments, wings, and antennae follow natural proportions typical of stylized insect designs, with no visible warping or geometric anomalies. Similarly, the flower has five evenly shaped petals arranged symmetrically around a central golden disc, consistent with common floral representations. There are no jagged lines, misaligned parts, or distorted proportions that would suggest digital artifacts or rendering errors. Based on visual inspection and general design principles for collectible pins, these objects appear to be well-modeled and free from unnatural distortions.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the glossy stripes on the bee and the detailed petals on the flower retain their fine details without any loss or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bee's black and yellow stripes exhibit a high level of surface detail, with reflective highlights suggesting a polished, enamel-like finish. The transition between colors is sharp and consistent, indicating good texture resolution. The flower’s petals have subtle gradients and slight embossing, particularly near the center, which adds depth and realism. The golden center appears textured with small granular details, resembling pollen or metallic detailing. These elements are rendered clearly without pixelation or blurring, suggesting that the fine details are preserved. In contrast to lower-quality renders where textures might blur or repeat unnaturally, this image shows crisp, intentional detailing consistent with professional 3D modeling standards.",

      "question": "Do the materials of the bee's semi-translucent wings and the flower's golden center look natural and authentic within the context of the romantic display box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bee’s wings are depicted with a semi-translucent quality, featuring embedded sparkles or iridescent particles that simulate light refraction, giving them a delicate, almost magical appearance. This effect aligns with artistic interpretations of decorative jewelry rather than strict biological accuracy, but it is appropriate for a fantasy-themed collectible. The flower’s golden center has a granular, textured appearance reminiscent of real pollen or a finely crafted metallic element, enhancing its authenticity. Within the romantic, dreamlike setting of the display box—featuring soft lighting, floating petals, and a pastoral backdrop—these material choices contribute to a whimsical yet believable aesthetic. While not realistic in a literal sense, they are contextually appropriate and visually cohesive.",

      "question": "Does the pastel-colored, romantic display box with its soft cream finish and delicate gold trims maintain a cohesive color scheme and enhance the visual credibility of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The display box in Image B features a soft cream base color with gold trim and subtle floral motifs, complementing the warm, golden tones of the bee and flower collectibles. The overall palette—creams, golds, and soft pinks—is harmonious and evokes a romantic, vintage aesthetic. The lighting inside the box is warm and diffused, casting gentle glows that highlight the items without creating harsh reflections. The background includes a circular window showing a sunlit meadow, reinforcing the theme of nature and serenity. Together, these elements create a cohesive and immersive environment that enhances the perceived value and emotional appeal of the collectibles. The color scheme and design choices are consistent with luxury gift packaging, lending credibility to the product presentation.",

      "question": "Does the arrangement of the bee and flower figures side by side within the box convey harmony and friendship naturally without any structural inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bee and flower are placed parallel to each other, centered within the box, with balanced spacing that suggests a deliberate and thoughtful composition. Their orientation—bee facing slightly toward the flower—implies a narrative of interaction, such as pollination or companionship, which supports the theme of 'Eternity Blossom.' The symmetry and alignment are precise, with no overlapping or misplacement that would disrupt visual harmony. The surrounding lighting and soft shadows further unify the scene, emphasizing their relationship. Structurally, there are no inconsistencies in scale, proportion, or positioning. This arrangement feels intentional and emotionally resonant, fitting the romantic and thematic intent of the product.",
