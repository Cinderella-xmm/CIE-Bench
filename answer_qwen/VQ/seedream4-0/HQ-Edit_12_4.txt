    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to have clear, smooth transparency. The light refraction and reflection are realistic, as the edges of objects within the dome are sharp and not distorted. There are no visible jagged edges or distortions that would suggest a lack of realism. The visual cues such as the clarity of the pocket watch and books under the dome support this conclusion.",
