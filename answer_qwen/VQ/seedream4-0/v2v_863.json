      "question": "Does the chibi-style elephant maintain its identifiable traits like tusks and large ears without any unnatural distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style elephant is depicted with clearly visible tusks and large ears, both of which are characteristic features of elephants. The tusks are short but proportionate to the stylized body, and the ears are oversized in a way typical of chibi or cartoon aesthetics, which exaggerates features for cuteness rather than realism. These traits are consistent with common artistic representations of elephants in chibi style, where anatomical accuracy is sacrificed for charm. There are no visible distortions such as misshapen limbs or disproportionate facial features that would suggest an unnatural rendering. Thus, despite being stylized, the key identifying traits are preserved and presented in a coherent, intentional manner.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the textures and fine details of the elephant's skin accurately represented in the chibi-style 3D rendering without any loss or unnatural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi-style elephant in Image B has a smooth, simplified surface texture typical of cartoon or toy-like 3D models. While real elephant skin is thick, wrinkled, and textured, this stylized version omits those details in favor of a clean, rounded aesthetic. However, the absence of fine details is not a flaw in this context—it aligns with the intended chibi design, which emphasizes simplicity and charm over realism. The skin appears uniformly colored with subtle shading to suggest volume, and there are no visual artifacts such as jagged edges or inconsistent lighting. Therefore, while the texture is not 'accurately' represented in a biological sense, it is appropriately rendered for the artistic style, maintaining coherence and avoiding unnatural appearances.",

      "question": "Do the earthy hues and organic textures on the cereal box appear natural and consistent with the theme of environmental harmony?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cereal box in Image B uses warm, earthy tones such as beige, brown, and green, which are commonly associated with natural, organic products. The imagery includes tropical fruits, grains, and plants, reinforcing a theme of nature and sustainability. The text on the box mentions 'organic,' 'natural sweeteners,' and 'tropical fruits,' further supporting the eco-friendly branding. These visual and textual elements work together to create a cohesive narrative of environmental harmony. The textures on the box—such as the grainy surface and illustrations of whole ingredients—are designed to look rustic and authentic, aligning with consumer expectations for healthy, natural foods. There are no jarring colors or mismatched elements that would disrupt this theme. Hence, the design successfully conveys a natural and harmonious aesthetic.",

      "question": "Does the chosen environment (rustic kitchen countertop or market stall) complement the cereal box and chibi elephant mascot without any visual inconsistencies or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The setting in Image B features a rustic outdoor kitchen or market stall with wooden structures, greenery, and a stone countertop. This environment supports the natural, wholesome theme of the cereal box, which emphasizes organic ingredients and tropical fruits. The presence of fresh produce like limes, oranges, and apples enhances the feeling of freshness and authenticity. The chibi elephant mascot fits into this scene without visual conflict; its playful, cartoonish style contrasts with the realistic background but does not clash due to the whimsical tone implied by the product packaging. Lighting is soft and natural, consistent with an outdoor setting, and there are no noticeable distortions such as floating objects or incorrect shadows. The overall composition feels balanced and thematically unified, suggesting careful design intent.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and physical rationality of the chibi elephant, cereal box, and environment maintained without any unnatural artifacts or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi elephant in Image B is proportionally exaggerated—larger head, small body, and oversized ears—but these are standard conventions in chibi art. The cereal box is sized realistically relative to the bowl of oats and the countertop, suggesting correct scaling. The elephant stands beside the box at a plausible height, indicating that the artist has maintained a consistent scale between the mascot and surrounding objects. The environment includes elements like a stove, pot, and fruit basket, all of which are placed logically and do not appear distorted or misaligned. Shadows and perspective are consistent with a single light source from above, and there are no floating objects or warped surfaces. Although the elephant is stylized, its placement and interaction with the environment remain physically plausible within the context of a staged promotional image. Therefore, the overall scene maintains rational proportions and spatial coherence.",
