    "Question": "Q1: Are the boundaries of the vintage travel case visible and seamlessly integrated into the scene without sudden shifts in perspective or lighting?",
    "explanation": "The vintage travel case in Image B is clearly defined with visible edges, hinges, latches, and a leather exterior that frames the diorama. The case’s structure is consistent with real-world physics—its rectangular shape and depth are evident. However, the integration of the diorama within the case appears seamless due to careful attention to lighting and perspective. The light source seems to come from above, casting soft shadows inside the case, which aligns with the direction of shadows on the elephant and grass. There are no abrupt changes in lighting or perspective between the interior of the case and its surroundings, suggesting a deliberate artistic choice to maintain continuity. The edges of the case are slightly elevated above the base, but they do not disrupt the illusion of depth. Therefore, despite being a physical container, the case's boundaries are visually integrated into the scene without breaking immersion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the textured resin grass show individual blades with natural variation in length and angle, and does it cast soft shadows consistent with the light source?",
    "explanation": "The grass in the diorama is made of textured resin, designed to mimic natural grass. Upon close inspection, individual blades can be seen with varying lengths and angles, contributing to a realistic, non-uniform appearance. This variation enhances the perception of depth and natural growth patterns. Additionally, the grass casts subtle shadows that follow the direction of the overhead light source, which is consistent with the shadows on the elephant and other elements. These shadows are soft and diffused, indicating a single, broad light source typical of daylight. The consistency in shadow direction and softness supports the realism of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the miniature acacia tree significantly smaller than the elephant and placed at a distance that creates a believable sense of scale within the diorama?",
    "explanation": "The acacia tree in the diorama is positioned to the right of the elephant and is visibly smaller in height and girth compared to the elephant. Given that African elephants are large animals (up to 10–13 feet tall), and acacia trees typically grow to heights of 20–40 feet, the relative size of the tree in this context appears proportionally reduced. However, the placement of the tree at a slight distance behind the elephant creates a sense of depth and spatial separation. This positioning allows for a plausible scale relationship, where the tree appears appropriately sized for a miniature landscape. While the tree is small, its placement and proportions contribute to a believable diorama environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the painted clouds located on the inner surface of the lid, showing no specular highlights or depth inconsistencies that would suggest they are floating?",
    "explanation": "The clouds in the diorama are painted directly onto the inner surface of the suitcase lid, as evidenced by their flat, two-dimensional appearance and uniform texture. They lack any specular highlights or reflections that would indicate a three-dimensional object. Their edges are smooth and blend into the blue background without any depth cues such as parallax or shadowing. Since they are part of the painted backdrop and not physically raised or layered, there is no indication of them floating above the scene. The lighting is consistent across the entire lid, reinforcing the idea that the clouds are a flat, painted element. Thus, they appear integrated into the lid without visual anomalies.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the brass compass resting flat on the base with a clear reflection and shadow that matches the lighting direction and surface texture?",
    "explanation": "The brass compass is placed on the surface in front of the suitcase. It rests flat, with its circular face aligned horizontally. A faint reflection is visible on the polished brass surface, consistent with ambient light coming from above. The shadow beneath the compass is soft and elongated slightly toward the back, matching the direction of the shadows cast by other objects in the scene. The surface texture beneath the compass appears smooth and slightly reflective, allowing for a subtle interaction between the object and its environment. The shadow and reflection both align with the lighting direction observed in the rest of the diorama, supporting the coherence of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Does the elephant retain natural skin texture, correct limb proportions, and intact tusk curvature without any visible deformation or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The elephant model in the diorama exhibits detailed skin texture with wrinkles and folds consistent with real elephant anatomy. The limbs are proportionate—legs are sturdy and correctly scaled relative to the body—and the trunk curves naturally downward. The tusks are symmetrical and smoothly curved, showing no signs of deformation or digital artifacts. The material appears to be sculpted resin or similar medium, with fine detail that avoids pixelation. There are no jagged edges or distortions, and the overall form adheres closely to biological accuracy. This suggests high-quality craftsmanship in the model.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q7: Do all objects in the diorama cast shadows in the same direction and with similar softness, consistent with a single light source from above?",
    "explanation": "All objects in the diorama—including the elephant, grass, tree, mountains, and compass—cast shadows that point in a consistent direction, generally toward the lower right of the image. The shadows are soft and diffused, indicating a broad, overhead light source, likely simulating daylight. The lighting is uniform across the scene, with no conflicting shadow directions or sharp contrasts that would suggest multiple light sources. Even the painted clouds on the lid do not produce shadows, which is expected since they are flat. The consistency in shadow direction and softness supports the presence of a single, coherent light source, enhancing the realism of the diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
