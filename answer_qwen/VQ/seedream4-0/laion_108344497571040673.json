      "question": "Does the standing cat’s body exhibit a uniformly soft, plush-like texture with exaggeratedly round and fluffy features throughout, without any visible patches of natural fur or inconsistent material transitions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the standing cat is clearly a plush toy, not a real animal. Its body exhibits a uniformly soft, plush-like texture throughout, with no visible patches of natural fur or inconsistent material transitions. The surface appears consistent in color and texture—orange on the outer parts and white on the belly and paws—typical of felted or wool-based plush toys. The fur is evenly distributed, and there are no signs of hair variation or skin exposure that would suggest a real cat. This uniformity and lack of natural imperfections support the conclusion that it is entirely constructed from plush materials, with exaggeratedly round and fluffy features common in stylized toy design.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the eyes of both cats replaced with small, shiny, circular button-like objects and the noses with flat, felt-like shapes that are proportionally appropriate and seamlessly integrated into the plush form?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes of both cats in Image B are indeed small, shiny, circular button-like objects, which are characteristic of handmade plush toys. These eyes are metallic or reflective, giving them a glossy appearance, and they are symmetrically placed within the facial structure. The noses are flat, pink, and shaped like small ovals or triangles, resembling felt pieces sewn onto the face. They are proportionally appropriate to the size of the heads and seamlessly integrated into the overall plush form, without any visible stitching flaws or misalignment. This matches typical craftsmanship in handcrafted stuffed animals, where such features are added for aesthetic appeal and durability.",

      "question": "Is the red shopping cart correctly scaled to fit the toy-sized cats and does it retain proper geometric structure with undistorted bars, wheels, and handle, without any broken or warped components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red shopping cart in Image B is scaled appropriately for the toy-sized cats. It maintains proper geometric structure with straight bars, intact wheels, and a functional handle. There are no visible distortions, broken components, or warped sections. The cart’s proportions align with those of a miniature version of a standard shopping cart, and its placement relative to the cats suggests correct scaling. The wheels appear to be securely attached, and the frame shows no signs of bending or deformation, indicating careful construction and accurate representation of the object in a toy context.",

      "question": "Is the background composed of vivid, lush green foliage with natural textures and lighting that provide a clear contrast to the toy cats without any unnatural color shifts or blurred edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of blurred green foliage, which provides a natural contrast to the brightly colored plush cats. The lighting appears soft and diffused, suggesting an outdoor setting with ambient daylight. While the details of individual leaves are not sharp due to the shallow depth of field, the colors remain vivid and consistent with natural vegetation. There are no noticeable unnatural color shifts or abrupt edges, and the blur is smooth, indicating intentional photographic technique rather than digital artifacts. This creates a realistic backdrop that enhances the visual appeal of the toy subjects without distracting from them.",

      "question": "Does the standing cat’s front paws properly grip the handle of the trolley in a stable and anatomically plausible manner for a plush toy figure, without unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The standing cat’s front paws are positioned on the handle of the trolley in a way that appears stable and anatomically plausible for a plush toy figure. The limbs are bent at natural-looking angles, and the paws grip the handle firmly without any unnatural stretching or bending. Given that this is a toy, the articulation is designed to mimic a walking or pushing motion, and the pose is consistent with how such figures are typically constructed. The positioning allows for balance and suggests movement, which is appropriate for the scene depicted. No visible strain or distortion in the limbs indicates that the design respects both form and function within the context of a plush toy.",
