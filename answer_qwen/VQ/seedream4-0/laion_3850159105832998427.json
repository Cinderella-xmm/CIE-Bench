      "question": "Do the golden horn-like spikes on the headstock align symmetrically with the neck and show no signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golden horn-like spikes are positioned at the top of the headstock. They appear to be symmetrical in relation to the neck's central axis, suggesting careful design alignment. There are no visible signs of clipping, distortion, or mismatched angles that would disrupt this symmetry. The visual cues indicate a seamless integration of these elements into the guitar's structure.",

      "question": "Are the luminescent runes clearly visible along the fretboard without bleeding into the wood or appearing as separate floating overlays?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The luminescent runes in Image B are distinctly visible along the fretboard. They do not bleed into the surrounding wood, maintaining clear boundaries. Additionally, they do not appear as separate floating overlays but rather as integrated designs within the fretboard, which suggests a high level of detail and precision in their placement.",

      "question": "Do the fiery tendrils originate from the bridge and terminate at the nut, following a continuous and uninterrupted path without gaps or floating segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fiery tendrils in Image B begin at the bridge area and extend upwards towards the nut. They follow a continuous path, with no noticeable gaps or floating segments. This creates a cohesive visual effect that enhances the dragon theme, indicating a well-executed design choice.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the wing structures symmetrical on both sides of the body and covered in evenly spaced, realistic scale patterns without gaps or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wings in Image B exhibit symmetry on both sides of the guitar body. The scale patterns are evenly spaced and realistic, contributing to an authentic dragon appearance. There are no apparent gaps or distortions in the scale patterns, ensuring a consistent texture across the wings.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the body maintain the original guitar's silhouette while showing consistent dragon-like textures such as scales or ridges, with no visible seams or loss of contour detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the guitar in Image B retains the original silhouette, with added dragon-like textures such as scales and ridges. These textures are consistent throughout the body, and there are no visible seams or loss of contour detail. This indicates a successful blending of the guitar's form with the dragon aesthetic.",
