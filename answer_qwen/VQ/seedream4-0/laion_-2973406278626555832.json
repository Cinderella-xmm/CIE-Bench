      "question": "Does the laboratory background in Panel 1 have consistent lighting and depth alignment with the foreground figure, avoiding floating or disconnected elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the background depicts a laboratory setting with shelves, glassware, and equipment. The lighting appears to be evenly distributed across the scene, with soft shadows and highlights that suggest a consistent light source, likely overhead fluorescent lighting common in labs. The depth of field is shallow, blurring the background slightly, which is typical for focusing on a subject in the foreground. However, upon closer inspection, the figure's head and shoulders appear to be composited into this background, and there are subtle mismatches in lighting direction—specifically, the lighting on the man’s face and clothing seems brighter and more directional than the ambient lab lighting. Additionally, the edges of his clothing and turban do not fully integrate with the background, showing slight color discrepancies and lack of shadowing that would naturally occur if he were physically present in that environment. These inconsistencies suggest a digital composite rather than a seamless integration, resulting in a 'floating' appearance. Therefore, while the lighting and depth are plausible individually, they are not consistently aligned.",

      "question": "Is the vape device held in the hand at a natural angle and proportion, with no stretching, compression, or misalignment of fingers around it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the vape device in Panel 1 shows a grip that appears anatomically plausible. The fingers wrap around the device in a natural way, with the thumb on one side and the other fingers curled around the back. The proportions of the hand and the device are consistent with real-world expectations—the device is small enough to fit comfortably in the palm. There is no visible stretching or compression of the fingers, and the joints appear to bend naturally. The angle of the device relative to the hand is also realistic, as it is held upright, mimicking how someone might inspect or use such a device. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of human hand anatomy and object interaction, the grip and positioning appear natural.",

      "question": "Does the vape device in Panel 1 show clear glass transparency, smooth surface reflections, and accurate labeling without pixelation, blurring, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vape device in Panel 1 has a transparent cylindrical body, which allows visibility of the liquid inside. The surface appears smooth, with subtle reflections that mimic real glass under artificial lighting. However, upon close inspection, the reflections are somewhat uniform and lack the complex refraction and distortion typically seen in real glass objects. The label on the device is legible but exhibits minor pixelation, especially along the edges of the text and the black cap. Additionally, the highlight on the top of the device appears overly sharp and lacks diffusion, suggesting an artificial rendering rather than a photorealistic capture. While the transparency and general shape are accurate, the lack of realistic optical effects and presence of slight artifacts indicate suboptimal rendering quality.",

      "question": "Are the internal components in Panel 2 shown with correct relative sizes and connections, such as the coil being positioned above the liquid and the airflow path following a continuous route without broken lines or impossible geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Panel 2 includes two diagrams of the vape device's internal structure. In the left diagram, the coil is depicted above the liquid reservoir, which is correct in terms of function—vaporization occurs when the coil heats the liquid. However, the labeling is inconsistent: 'Cnol' (likely a typo for 'Coil') and repeated 'Liquid' labels suggest poor attention to detail. The airflow path is not clearly indicated, and the connection between the battery and the coil appears oversimplified. In the right diagram, the coil is again shown above the liquid, which is anatomically correct. However, the airflow path is labeled twice as 'Altow' (a misspelling of 'Airflow'), and the lines indicating airflow are discontinuous and illogical—airflow should follow a continuous path from the mouthpiece through the coil and into the chamber, but here it appears to loop incorrectly. Furthermore, the coil's spiral design is exaggerated and does not reflect real-world engineering. The overall layout suggests a conceptual rather than technically accurate representation, with incorrect labeling and flawed geometry.",

      "question": "Do the text bubbles and labels in both panels avoid overlapping critical facial or clothing features, and are they aligned with natural reading direction without clipping or misplacement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Panel 1, the speech bubble is positioned to the upper left of the man’s head, well away from his face and clothing, ensuring no obstruction of key features. It is oriented correctly for natural reading direction (left to right), and its tail points toward the speaker’s mouth without clipping or misalignment. In Panel 2, the labels are placed outside the main illustration area, with 'Battery', 'Cnol', 'Liquid', and 'Altow' positioned adjacent to their respective parts. These labels do not overlap any critical components or interfere with the viewer’s understanding. The second speech bubble in the right panel is also placed to the side, not covering any part of the diagram, and follows standard reading direction. There is no visible clipping or misplacement of text, and all elements are clearly legible. Thus, the placement of text is thoughtful and adheres to good design principles.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the vape device have exactly five fingers with natural joint bends and no visible deformities, such as fused or elongated fingers?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the vape device in Panel 1 displays five distinct fingers: thumb, index, middle, ring, and pinky. Each finger shows natural curvature and joint bending consistent with a relaxed grip. There are no signs of fusion, elongation, or unnatural spacing between the fingers. The knuckles and phalanges appear proportionate and correctly aligned. The hand’s posture matches typical human anatomy when holding a small cylindrical object. No deformities or distortions are evident, and the hand appears anatomically accurate based on visual cues and biological knowledge.",

      "question": "Is there a clean boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, with no visible seams, double outlines, or color mismatches along the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the photographic figure in Panel 1 and the illustrated sections below is marked by a thick black border that separates the two regions. This border is consistent and acts as a deliberate framing device, preventing any direct visual continuity between the photo and the illustrations. Within Panel 1, the figure appears to be superimposed onto the background, but there is no visible seam or double outline along the edges of the person’s clothing or head. However, due to the compositing, there are slight color mismatches—especially around the edges of the white garment and turban—where the lighting does not blend seamlessly with the background. These subtle inconsistencies suggest digital editing, but since the question refers to the boundary between the photographic figure and the illustrated panels, and these are separated by a clear frame, the edge between them is clean. The illustrated panels themselves do not bleed into the photograph, and there are no artifacts at the junction. Therefore, despite some imperfections in the composite, the structural boundary is clean.",
