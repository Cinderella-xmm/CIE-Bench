    "Question": "Q1: Are the eyes and mouth drawn on the whoopie pie surfaces aligned with the curvature of the cookie and free from visible distortions or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two whoopie pie characters peering over the plate have cartoon-style facial features—eyes and mouths—drawn directly onto their chocolate cookie surfaces. The eyes are positioned symmetrically and follow the round shape of the cookies, appearing to be embedded into the surface rather than floating above it. Their placement respects the curvature of the circular cookies, as they are not stretched or distorted in a way that contradicts the 3D form of the cookie. The pupils are centered within the eye circles, and the mouth is a small curved line beneath, consistent with typical cartoon character design. There are no visible floating elements or misalignments that suggest the features are disconnected from the surface. This alignment is achieved through careful illustration techniques that simulate depth and contour, aligning with common practices in animated character design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the chocolate cookie surface retain its original texture pattern (such as cracks and dimples) beneath the cartoon-style coloring, or is it completely smoothed out in an unnatural way?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chocolate cookie surfaces of the whoopie pies are stylized with cartoon rendering, but subtle textural details such as cracks and slight irregularities are preserved. These textures are not fully smoothed out; instead, they are simplified and integrated into the cartoon style. For example, faint crack-like lines are visible on the top of each cookie, mimicking the natural baking imperfections seen in real whoopie pies. These details help maintain a sense of realism within the exaggerated art style. The texture is not erased entirely, which would make the cookies look unnaturally perfect, but rather adapted to fit the artistic medium while retaining recognizable characteristics of baked goods. This balance between stylization and realism is common in food-themed cartoons, where authenticity is maintained through symbolic detail.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the limbs of the whoopie pie characters proportionally scaled to the cookie body and connected at logical points (e.g., sides or top), without appearing detached or misaligned?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the limbs of the whoopie pie characters are drawn in a cartoonish style but maintain proportional scaling relative to the size of the cookie bodies. The arms and legs are attached at the sides and bottom of the cookies, respectively, which is a logical anatomical placement for anthropomorphic objects. The limbs are not disproportionately large or small compared to the body, and there are no floating or detached parts. In the lower panel, the running whoopie pie has arms and legs extending naturally from the sides and base, with joints suggesting movement. The attachment points are consistent with how one might imagine limbs growing from a round object. While exaggerated for humor, the proportions and connections remain coherent and plausible within the context of cartoon animation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character proportionally sized compared to the cookie body and oriented in a way that suggests natural grip and movement?",
    "explanation": "The spatula held by the leading whoopie pie character in the lower panel of Image B is proportionally larger than the cookie body, which is typical in cartoon exaggeration to emphasize action or humor. However, despite its size, the spatula is oriented diagonally upward, with the handle gripped firmly in one hand, suggesting a dynamic pose. The angle and position imply forward motion, consistent with the character's 'running' posture. While not realistic in scale, the orientation and grip appear intentional and functional within the cartoon logic. The hand wraps around the handle, and the blade extends outward, indicating purposeful use. Such stylistic choices are common in animated sequences to convey energy and intent without strict adherence to real-world physics.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the two whoopie pie characters peering over the edge of the plate positioned so that their lower halves remain below the plate’s edge, with no unnatural floating or cut-off limbs?",
    "explanation": "In the upper panel of Image B, the two whoopie pie characters are shown leaning over the edge of a white plate. Their upper portions (faces and upper bodies) are visible above the plate, while their lower halves, including legs and feet, extend downward and are partially hidden beneath the plate's edge. This positioning creates the illusion that they are peeking over the rim, which is a common visual trope in cartoons to suggest curiosity or anticipation. There is no indication of floating limbs or unnatural cutoffs; instead, the legs are angled downward as if resting on a surface just below the plate. The design respects the physical relationship between the characters and the plate, maintaining continuity and spatial logic within the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q6: Is the text bubble containing “I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!” placed adjacent to the speaking character without overlapping critical features like eyes or limbs, and is the handwritten font clear and unblurred?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the speech bubble containing the phrase 'I heard today’s flavor is mint! Let’s find it!' is positioned to the right of the leftmost whoopie pie character in the upper panel. It does not overlap with any part of the character’s face, eyes, or limbs, allowing full visibility of the character’s expression. The bubble is cleanly separated from the figure, with a pointer correctly directed toward the character’s mouth area, indicating the source of speech. The font used is a handwritten-style script that is legible and free from blurring or distortion. Each letter is distinct, and the spacing is even, contributing to readability. This layout adheres to standard comic book conventions for speech bubbles, ensuring clarity and visual coherence without obstructing key visual elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
