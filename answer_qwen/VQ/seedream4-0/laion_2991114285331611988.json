      "question": "Is the watch communicator on the plaid tie positioned naturally within the fabric, with consistent color, texture, and lighting that match the surrounding material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the plaid tie is anthropomorphized into a character, with arms and a hand holding a smartphone-like device. The wristwatch on its left arm appears to be digitally added as part of the cartoonish design. While the watch has a metallic appearance and dark band, it does not seamlessly blend into the fabric of the tie. The texture of the watch contrasts sharply with the woven plaid pattern of the tie—its smooth, reflective surface lacks the textile consistency of the surrounding material. Additionally, the lighting on the watch seems inconsistent; it reflects light in a way that suggests artificial rendering rather than natural illumination from the environment. Furthermore, the placement of the watch on the 'wrist' area of the tie’s arm is awkward—it doesn’t follow realistic anatomy or fabric draping. These discrepancies indicate that the watch is not integrated naturally into the fabric.",

      "question": "Is the camera lens embedded in the emblem on the right suit’s lapel aligned with the pattern and fabric, showing no gaps, misaligned edges, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emblem on the plaid tie in the lower panel of Image B features a crest with a crown and shield. Superimposed onto this emblem is a small camera lens, which appears to be digitally inserted. Upon close inspection, the lens exhibits sharp, overly defined edges that do not align with the soft, embroidered texture of the surrounding fabric. There are visible gaps between the lens and the fabric, suggesting poor integration. Moreover, the highlight on the lens is unnaturally bright and uniform, lacking the subtle gradation expected from real-world reflections on glass. This artificial glow and lack of shadowing indicate digital manipulation. The lens also does not conform to the curvature or weave of the fabric, further breaking the illusion of physical continuity. Therefore, the embedding is not seamless.",

      "question": "Are the thought bubbles and dialogue text clearly separated from the characters’ faces and clothing, with clean lines and no overlap or distortion of nearby features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the speech and thought bubbles are drawn in a comic book style, with clear outlines and white fill. They are positioned above and near the characters without overlapping their facial features or clothing. However, in the upper panel, the thought bubble emanating from the plaid tie touches the edge of the tie’s fabric, creating a slight visual ambiguity. The tail of the bubble is close enough to suggest an intersection with the fabric, though not fully overlapping. In the lower panel, the dialogue bubbles are well-separated from the man's face and the tie figure, maintaining clean boundaries. The text inside the bubbles is legible and does not distort any nearby elements. Overall, while there is minor proximity in one instance, the bubbles are mostly cleanly placed without distorting features or causing visual confusion.",

      "question": "Do the characters’ necks and shoulders retain natural proportions and smooth contours, without stretched, compressed, or fragmented shapes after anthropomorphization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The plaid tie in Image B has been anthropomorphized, giving it arms and hands, but it lacks a visible head or neck structure. Instead, the tie serves as the body, with limbs attached at the top and bottom. This transformation inherently alters anatomical proportions—there is no realistic neck or shoulder joint, as these would be impossible for a piece of fabric. The arms extend directly from the tie's upper section, bypassing any natural human-like musculature or bone structure. While the arms are proportionate to the size of the tie, the overall form is stylized and exaggerated, consistent with cartoon logic. However, the question asks whether the necks and shoulders retain natural proportions. Since the tie character has no neck or shoulders in a biological sense, the concept of 'natural' anatomy does not apply. Yet, the human figure (the man with glasses) retains normal proportions and smooth contours. The anthropomorphized tie, however, clearly violates natural anatomical expectations. Thus, the answer must reflect the absence of natural anatomy in the transformed object.",

      "question": "Is the grassy field and sky background free from distortion, noise, or color inconsistencies that suggest digital manipulation or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in both panels of Image B consists of a lush green field under a bright sky. The grass appears detailed with individual blades visible, and the lighting suggests a sunny day with soft shadows. There are no obvious signs of pixelation, blurring, or artifacts that would indicate compression or digital corruption. The colors are consistent across the field, with natural gradients from light to dark green. The sky is evenly lit with no streaks or unnatural hues. While the image is stylized and partially cartoonified (especially in the foreground), the background remains largely photographic in quality. The transition between the foreground and background is smooth, and there is no evidence of warping or mismatched textures. Therefore, the background appears to be free from significant digital manipulation or degradation.",
