      "question": "Does the cat maintain natural proportions and anatomical structure without visible stretching, compression, or deformation in the shadow box scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cat is depicted seated on a small, ornate red settee within a miniature theatrical stage setting. The cat’s body appears proportionally consistent with typical feline anatomy—its torso, limbs, and head are well-aligned and exhibit natural musculature and fur patterns. There is no visible distortion such as unnatural elongation of limbs, exaggerated girth, or compressed features. The cat's posture, with front paws resting comfortably and tail curled naturally, aligns with realistic feline behavior. While the scale of the cat relative to the environment suggests a stylized or whimsical interpretation (as it is much larger than the surrounding mice and furniture), its own internal proportions remain anatomically accurate. This conclusion is based on visual cues like symmetrical limb placement, correct joint angles, and consistent fur striping across the body, which all support a natural representation. No signs of digital warping or deformation are evident.",

      "question": "Are the materials of the settee (velvet and wood) rendered with realistic textures and consistent lighting, showing no signs of pixelation, mismatched shading, or artificial seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The settee in Image B features rich red velvet upholstery and intricately carved golden wooden framing. The velvet exhibits a soft, plush texture with subtle sheen and depth, consistent with how light interacts with real fabric—especially noticeable in the way highlights fall along the cushion edges and creases. The wood elements display detailed carvings with smooth gradients and reflections that suggest a polished surface. Lighting appears consistent across both materials, with shadows and highlights logically aligned with the direction of ambient illumination from above. There are no visible pixelation artifacts, jagged edges, or abrupt transitions between textures. The seam where the velvet meets the frame is clean and blends seamlessly, indicating high-quality rendering. Compared to typical digital art standards, this level of detail and material consistency suggests professional-grade rendering techniques were used.",

      "question": "Do the velvet curtains appear physically plausible with correct fold patterns, soft shadows, and seamless integration into the background without floating or misaligned edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The red velvet curtains in Image B hang symmetrically from a draped valance, forming natural-looking folds that cascade downward. These folds follow gravitational logic, with deeper creases near the top and softer draping toward the bottom, mimicking real fabric behavior. Soft shadows are cast beneath the folds and along the curtain edges, enhancing depth and realism. The curtains are anchored at the sides by gold tassels and tied back with rope-like details, contributing to their grounded appearance. There are no floating sections or misaligned edges; instead, the curtains blend smoothly into the surrounding wall and stage frame. The texture of the velvet matches that of the settee, suggesting consistent material properties. All these factors indicate a physically plausible and well-integrated design.",

      "question": "Are the gilded columns properly scaled, positioned with correct perspective, and rendered with reflective metallic surfaces that match the ambient light without artifacts like blurring or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The four gilded columns in Image B are arranged symmetrically around the central throne-like settee, with two flanking each side. Their height and thickness are proportionate to the scale of the stage and the cat, maintaining proper perspective—columns closer to the viewer appear slightly larger than those farther away, consistent with linear perspective rules. The surface of the columns has a polished, reflective metallic finish, with subtle highlights and soft glares that reflect the ambient light source above. These reflections are smooth and continuous, lacking any blurring, jagged edges, or aliasing artifacts. The decorative capitals and fluted shafts are clearly defined, indicating high-resolution rendering. Overall, the columns appear structurally sound and visually coherent within the scene’s architectural style.",

      "question": "Are the hanging mouse portraits clearly visible, correctly sized relative to the scene, and mounted with realistic shadows and string attachments without visual glitches or texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Three framed mouse portraits hang from thin strings against the dark backdrop behind the cat. Each portrait is oval-shaped and contains a detailed illustration of a mouse, clearly visible despite their small size. The frames are proportionally sized to fit the scale of the miniature theater setting—small enough to be decorative but large enough to discern facial features. The strings suspending them appear taut and attached at the top of each frame, casting faint but plausible shadows onto the wall below, indicating a directional light source. There are no visual glitches such as floating frames, missing textures, or clipping issues. The texture of the frames and the painted surfaces within them are consistent with the rest of the scene’s artistic style, showing no pixelation or distortion. Given the tiny scale of these elements, their clarity and integration suggest careful attention to detail in the rendering process.",
