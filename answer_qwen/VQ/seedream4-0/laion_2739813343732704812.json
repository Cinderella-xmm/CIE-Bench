      "question": "Is the pelican's beak elongated but still attached naturally to the head without bending or breaking at the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the pelican's beak is visibly elongated, consistent with typical pelican anatomy. The beak connects smoothly to the head without any visible bends, breaks, or unnatural separations at the base. Its shape follows a natural curvature, and there are no visual distortions suggesting detachment or structural compromise. This alignment is consistent with how pelicans are depicted in stylized illustrations—while exaggerated for cartoonish effect, the attachment remains anatomically plausible within the artistic context. Therefore, despite being stylized, the beak appears intact and naturally connected.",

      "question": "Do the pelican’s feathers display visible layered texture despite being colored in pastel shades, without appearing uniformly smooth or pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The feathers in Image B are rendered with fine, directional lines that simulate the layered structure of real bird feathers. These lines vary in thickness and direction, creating a sense of depth and texture across the wings and body. Even though the colors are soft pastels (including pinks, blues, yellows, and purples), the feather patterns are not uniform or flat. Instead, they exhibit a gradient-like layering that mimics natural feather overlap. There is no evidence of pixelation or digital artifacts, indicating a clean vector-style rendering. Thus, the texture is clearly present and detailed, even within the stylized design.",

      "question": "Is the sailor hat positioned securely on the pelican’s head without overlapping the neck or appearing detached from the surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sailor hat in Image B sits atop the pelican’s head, centered and aligned with the contour of the crown. It does not extend over the neck or appear floating above the head; instead, it rests firmly as if placed directly on the top of the head. The brim of the hat curves naturally around the head, maintaining contact with the surface without gaps or shadows suggesting detachment. The hat’s placement is consistent with how such accessories are typically illustrated in cartoon designs—secure and integrated into the character’s silhouette. No visual cues suggest instability or misalignment.",

      "question": "Does the wooden plank background extend evenly behind the pelican without visible seams or inconsistencies in wood grain or lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of vertical wooden planks with consistent wood grain patterns running vertically. The planks are evenly spaced, and the texture appears continuous across the entire image. There are no abrupt changes in color, brightness, or grain direction that would suggest seams or digital拼接 (splicing). The lighting is uniform, with subtle shading that enhances the three-dimensional appearance of the wood without introducing artificial highlights or shadows. This suggests a well-designed, seamless background intended to mimic real wood paneling. No visual inconsistencies are present.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the pelican’s legs and feet proportionally aligned with the body and not distorted or bent in an unnatural way?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pelican’s legs in Image B are drawn in a simplified cartoon style but maintain proportional alignment with the body. They are positioned beneath the torso, supporting the weight of the bird in a natural stance. The feet are webbed and splayed slightly, consistent with pelican anatomy, and the toes are arranged in a realistic manner. While the proportions are somewhat exaggerated for stylistic reasons (e.g., thicker legs), there is no indication of unnatural bending, twisting, or disproportionate scaling. The limbs follow a logical path from the body to the ground, suggesting intentional design rather than distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Does the pelican appear as a flat, two-dimensional object with minimal depth cues and clean edges, consistent with a magnet design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts the pelican with bold, solid outlines and flat areas of color, lacking gradients or complex shading that would suggest volume. The edges are sharp and well-defined, typical of cut-out designs used for magnets or wall decorations. There is no significant shadowing beneath the pelican, nor are there perspective cues that imply depth. The overall aesthetic is minimalist and stylized, emphasizing clarity and simplicity—hallmarks of a 2D decorative item like a fridge magnet. The lack of depth and presence of clean borders strongly support the interpretation that this is meant to represent a flat object.",
