      "question": "Are the cogwheel joints clearly defined, aligned with the frame's geometry, and rendered with consistent metallic texture and shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the mechanical insect features multiple cogwheel joints at the articulation points of its legs. These joints are visually distinct, with well-defined gear teeth and circular symmetry that suggest precision engineering. The alignment of these joints appears to follow the biomechanical logic of limb movement, with hinges positioned naturally along the leg segments. The metallic texture is consistent across all joints—showing a coppery tone with subtle surface imperfections like scratches and patina, which enhance realism. Shading is coherent, with highlights and shadows following the curvature of the gears and indicating a single light source from the upper left. This consistency in material rendering and geometric alignment supports a high level of visual coherence and technical accuracy.",

      "question": "Does the carapace-shaped seat have detailed surface textures, proper curvature, and seamless attachment to the seat post without visible seams or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The carapace-shaped seat in Image B resembles a beetle’s back, crafted from a polished, copper-toned metal with intricate embossed patterns and embedded gears. Its surface texture includes fine detailing such as rivets, engraved lines, and subtle wear marks, contributing to a realistic industrial aesthetic. The curvature follows an organic yet structured form, mimicking natural insect anatomy while maintaining mechanical integrity. It connects to the seat post via a smooth, cylindrical joint that blends seamlessly into the overall structure. There are no visible seams, gaps, or warping; the transition between the seat and the post is fluid, suggesting careful modeling and texturing. This integration enhances the believability of the steampunk design.",

      "question": "Do the mechanical legs have realistic hinge mechanisms, correct proportions, and no overlapping or misplaced segments that break spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical legs in Image B consist of articulated segments connected by ball-and-socket and pivot joints, resembling both biological limbs and industrial machinery. Each leg has three main segments (femur, tibia, and foot), proportionally scaled to support the body weight realistically. The hinges are clearly defined with visible bolts, pins, and rotating components, demonstrating functional design. There is no overlap or misalignment between segments—the legs extend outward symmetrically and maintain plausible spatial relationships. The foot ends in small spherical tips, suggesting stability on uneven surfaces. Overall, the leg construction adheres to both mechanical plausibility and anatomical balance, avoiding any visual contradictions.",

      "question": "Are the wingtips smoothly attached to the top tube, showing consistent copper coloring, reflective properties, and no jagged edges or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wingtips in Image B are stylized representations of insect wings, constructed from copper-colored metal with vein-like etchings that mimic natural wing structures. They are affixed to the top tube (the elongated neck-like structure) using brass fittings and joints that allow for slight articulation. The attachment points are smooth and integrated, with no visible gaps or misalignments. The copper coloring is uniform across the wings, with appropriate highlights and reflections indicating a metallic surface under directional lighting. There are no jagged edges or repeating textures—each wing exhibits unique patterning and subtle variations in thickness and translucency, enhancing realism. The overall rendering avoids digital artifacts typical of low-resolution or poorly mapped textures.",

      "question": "Are the clock faces clearly visible, properly embedded in the handlebars, and free from texture artifacts, incorrect lighting, or distorted numerals/runes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Three clock faces are mounted on the upper part of the insect’s neck structure, serving as decorative and functional elements. Each clock face is round, with Roman numerals clearly legible and correctly oriented. The hands point to different times, adding narrative depth. They are embedded within brass casings that connect seamlessly to the central pipe-like structure, resembling handlebars. The lighting on the clocks is consistent with the ambient illumination—soft glows around the edges suggest internal illumination, while reflections match the surrounding metallic surfaces. There are no texture artifacts such as pixelation, blurring, or tiling errors. The numerals are sharp and undistorted, and the overall design integrates the clocks into the steampunk theme without breaking visual continuity.",

      "question": "Do all newly added mechanical elements (legs, joints, wings, clocks) share consistent material properties, such as metallic sheen, color tone, and surface imperfections, without abrupt visual breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All newly added mechanical elements in Image B—including the legs, joints, wings, and clocks—are rendered in a cohesive steampunk style using predominantly copper and brass materials. The metallic sheen is consistent across all parts, with similar levels of reflectivity and specular highlights. The color tone remains within a warm bronze-copper spectrum, accented with darker oxidation and minor scratches that simulate age and use. Surface imperfections like dents, wear marks, and patina are uniformly distributed, reinforcing a sense of realism. There are no abrupt transitions or mismatches in material appearance; every component feels like it belongs to the same fabricated universe. This visual harmony ensures that the entire construct reads as a unified, believable mechanical organism.",
