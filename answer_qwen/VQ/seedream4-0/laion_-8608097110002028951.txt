    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The facade of the theater building in Image B is clearly composed of LEGO bricks, as indicated by the visible studs and uniform block shapes. The tan color with brown accents is consistent throughout, and there are no visible seams or irregular patterns that would suggest a non-LEGO construction.
