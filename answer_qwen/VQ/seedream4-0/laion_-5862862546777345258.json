      "question": "Does the church's façade maintain its original architectural shape and symmetry when rendered in porcelain, with no distorted columns, misaligned arches, or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the church is depicted within a glass dome as a miniature model. The façade appears to be a faithful reproduction of the original structure seen in Image A, preserving key architectural features such as the central arched doorway, the cross above it, the round window, and the symmetrical arrangement of decorative elements like pilasters and finials. The proportions of the tower and roofline are consistent with the original, and there are no visible distortions in the columns or arches. The symmetry is maintained, with balanced placement of windows and ornamental details on either side of the central axis. Given that this is a detailed porcelain model, minor imperfections might be expected, but none are apparent here. The craftsmanship suggests careful attention to architectural accuracy. Comparing to Image A, the model replicates the real church’s form accurately, indicating that the porcelain version maintains the original shape and symmetry.",

      "question": "Are all human figures replaced with pewter models that have anatomically correct hands with no more than five fingers, and do they maintain natural postures without joint bending or limb distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the human figures are small metallic figurines placed around the café tables. They appear to be made of a silver-toned material, consistent with pewter. Each figure has a distinct posture—some standing, some seated—suggesting intentional design for realism. Upon close inspection, their hands are proportionate and show no more than five fingers, which aligns with anatomical correctness. The limbs are straight and articulated in a way that mimics natural human movement without exaggerated bends or distortions. There is no evidence of mechanical joints or unnatural flexibility. While these are stylized models, they maintain a degree of realism appropriate for scale models. Compared to Image A, where people are real and varied in posture, the pewter figures replicate typical human behavior in a simplified but accurate manner. No visual flaws such as extra fingers or bent limbs are present.",

      "question": "Is the baroque-style dome fully enclosing the scene without gaps, overlapping incorrectly with the church or ground, or showing seams or incomplete surfaces?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The dome in Image B is a clear, curved glass enclosure that sits atop an ornate porcelain frame. It appears seamless and fully encloses the miniature scene below. There are no visible gaps between the dome and the base, nor does it overlap improperly with the church or ground. The curvature is smooth and continuous, suggesting high-quality craftsmanship. The reflection and refraction of light through the glass indicate a solid, uninterrupted surface. While reflections from the environment (like ceiling lights) are visible, they do not suggest structural flaws. The dome rests securely on the base and conforms perfectly to the circular platform, with no signs of clipping or incomplete coverage. This level of detail supports the conclusion that the dome is properly constructed and fully enclosing the scene.",

      "question": "Do the glass trees retain natural branch structures and show transparent, refractive qualities without jagged outlines or unnatural coloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tree inside the dome is made of clear glass or crystal, featuring a branching structure that mimics a real tree. The branches are delicate and spread out naturally, resembling organic growth patterns. The transparency allows light to pass through, creating subtle refractions and highlights, which are characteristic of high-quality glasswork. There are no jagged edges or pixelated lines, indicating precise craftsmanship. The coloration is neutral and clear, consistent with glass, without any artificial tinting or discoloration. The base of the tree is slightly wider, providing stability, and the overall form is elegant and lifelike. Although it is stylized, it maintains the essence of a natural tree. Compared to real trees in Image A, this glass version abstracts reality but preserves key visual properties like transparency and branching symmetry.",

      "question": "Are the café tables and umbrellas scaled down appropriately with intact shapes—specifically, do the umbrella canopies remain circular and the table legs remain straight and evenly spaced?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The café setup in Image B includes several white umbrellas and wooden tables with chairs. The umbrellas are clearly circular in canopy shape, maintaining symmetry and proper scaling relative to the surrounding figures and furniture. The table legs are straight and uniformly spaced, indicating careful modeling. The tables themselves are proportionate to the seated figures, suggesting accurate scaling. There is no warping, tilting, or distortion in the table legs or umbrella frames. The entire café area is arranged logically, mirroring the layout seen in Image A. The miniaturization is done with precision, preserving functional geometry. Even though these are tiny models, their structural integrity is preserved, with no visible flaws in alignment or shape.",

      "question": "Does the antique marble base display consistent veining patterns and appropriate thickness, and is it positioned directly beneath the scene without floating or clipping errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the snow globe in Image B is crafted to resemble polished marble, with visible veins running through the surface in a natural pattern. These veins are continuous and follow realistic stone textures, contributing to the antique aesthetic. The thickness of the base appears substantial enough to support the dome and internal scene, avoiding any appearance of fragility or imbalance. It is firmly positioned beneath the glass dome, with no floating effect or clipping issues—there is a clean junction between the base and the lower edge of the dome. The ornate gold detailing along the rim enhances the classical style, and the base's curvature matches the dome's footprint. The positioning is stable and grounded, consistent with how such decorative objects are typically designed. There are no visual artifacts suggesting digital errors or poor integration between components.",
