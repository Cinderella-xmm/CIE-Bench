      "question": "Does the person retain a natural jumping pose that aligns with typical human biomechanics, avoiding any distortion or unnatural posturing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The person in Image B is depicted in a dynamic jumping pose with one leg extended forward and the other bent, arms positioned for balance. This pose does not align with typical human biomechanics for jumping, as it lacks the natural bend in the forward leg and the alignment of the body's center of gravity. The posture appears exaggerated and stylized, which is common in artistic representations but not realistic in terms of physical movement.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the bold outlines applied to the person and surrounding elements smooth and continuous, without any jagged edges or breaks that would disrupt the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bold outlines around the person and the surrounding elements are smooth and continuous. There are no visible jagged edges or breaks that disrupt the visual flow. The lines are consistent in thickness and follow the contours of the figure and background elements seamlessly, contributing to a cohesive and polished appearance.",

      "question": "Does the background blend the graffiti and concrete texture effectively, creating an authentic look without overlapping issues or blending that obscures either element's distinct characteristics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B combines graffiti and concrete textures effectively. The graffiti is layered over the concrete without overlapping issues, and both elements retain their distinct characteristics. The concrete texture provides a realistic base, while the graffiti adds vibrant colors and patterns, creating an authentic urban setting.",

      "question": "Has the individual's face been preserved authentically within the new artistic style, retaining identifiable features like the eyes, nose, and mouth without distortion or excessive simplification?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The individual's face in Image B has been preserved authentically within the new artistic style. Identifiable features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth are retained and recognizable despite the hand-drawn style. The proportions and expressions remain consistent with the original image, ensuring the person is still identifiable.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The details and patterns on the suit, tie, and shirt in Image B remain discernible within the hand-drawn style. The checkered pattern on the suit, the design on the tie, and the stripes on the shirt are clearly visible and maintain their defining characteristics. There is no unnatural smudging or loss of detail that would obscure these elements.",
