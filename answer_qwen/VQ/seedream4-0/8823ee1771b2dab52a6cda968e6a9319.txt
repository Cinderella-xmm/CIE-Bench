    "Question": "Q1: Does the figurine’s face maintain correct anatomical proportions with no visible warping or misshapen features?",
    "explanation": "The figurine's face in Image B is rendered with smooth, symmetrical features typical of high-quality porcelain craftsmanship. The eyes, nose, and mouth are proportionally balanced, with natural spacing and curvature consistent with human anatomy. The forehead is appropriately arched, and the jawline is defined without distortion. The facial structure aligns with classical aesthetic standards often seen in decorative porcelain figures, where precision and idealized beauty are emphasized. There are no signs of digital warping, asymmetry, or exaggerated features that would suggest deformation. Given the glossy finish and refined detailing, it is clear that the artist or manufacturer intended a lifelike yet stylized representation, which has been executed accurately.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the folds of the dress rendered with smooth, continuous surfaces resembling glazed porcelain, without cracked or fragmented areas?",
    "explanation": "The dress of the figurine in Image B exhibits a highly polished, reflective surface characteristic of glazed porcelain. The folds are smoothly curved and flow naturally from the bodice to the skirt, maintaining continuity without any visible cracks, breaks, or pixelation. The material appears seamless, with subtle highlights indicating a uniform glaze application. In contrast to real fabric, which might show texture or irregularities, this porcelain rendering uses fluid lines and gentle undulations to simulate drapery, all of which remain intact and unbroken. This reflects skilled craftsmanship in ceramic modeling, where such details are carefully sculpted and glazed to avoid imperfections.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the hand positioned correctly on the column with natural contact and no floating or clipped fingers?",
    "explanation": "The figurine’s right hand rests on the column, and its positioning appears anatomically accurate. The fingers are slightly curled and make full contact with the surface of the column, showing proper weight distribution and posture. There is no evidence of floating fingers or clipping artifacts—each digit is clearly defined and adheres to the expected form of a human hand in repose. The thumb is positioned naturally against the side of the column, and the palm is angled appropriately for support. The lighting enhances the three-dimensionality of the hand, reinforcing the illusion of solid contact with the column. No visual anomalies suggest digital manipulation or poor modeling.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the decorative patterns on the mantle and column appear clearly defined and scaled down appropriately for a miniature setting?",
    "explanation": "The decorative elements on the mantle and column in Image B are intricately detailed, featuring ornate carvings and gold accents that are consistent with classical architectural design. These patterns include acanthus leaves, scrollwork, and floral motifs, all of which are finely rendered and proportionate to the scale of the figurine and surrounding furniture. The size and clarity of these details suggest they have been appropriately downscaled for a miniature environment, as one would expect in a high-end porcelain display piece. The depth and definition of the engravings indicate careful craftsmanship, and there is no over-simplification or blurring that would imply poor scaling. The overall aesthetic harmony between the figurine and background supports the conclusion that the patterns are well-integrated and correctly sized.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the base of the figurine aligned with the surrounding elements and does it display consistent lighting and perspective with the rest of the scene?",
    "explanation": "The base of the figurine is firmly placed on a reflective wooden surface, and its alignment is consistent with the surrounding objects, including the column and the mantelpiece. The perspective is coherent, with the horizon line matching that of the background architecture. Lighting appears uniform across the scene, with soft shadows and highlights that follow the same direction—likely coming from the upper left—creating a realistic sense of depth. The reflection on the floor beneath the figurine matches the shape and color of the base, further confirming its proper placement. There is no evidence of misalignment, floating, or inconsistent shading that would disrupt the spatial logic of the composition. The integration of the figurine into the scene is seamless, suggesting careful staging and attention to visual consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
