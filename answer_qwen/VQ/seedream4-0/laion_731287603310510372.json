      "question": "Are the edges of the man’s head, cap, and shoulders sharp and unaltered by the added shadowy textures or angular lines, with no visible distortion or ghosting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's head, cap, and shoulders are clearly defined against a stylized background. The edges appear crisp and well-defined, especially when compared to typical image editing artifacts such as ghosting or blurring that occur during compositing. The shadows and angular lines in the background (like the large black triangle and radiating beams) do not overlap or distort the man’s silhouette. Instead, they are layered behind him, maintaining spatial separation. This suggests careful masking and layering techniques were used, preserving the integrity of the subject’s outline. There is no visible feathering, double outlines, or smudging along the edges, which would indicate poor integration. Therefore, based on visual inspection and standard image editing principles, the edges remain sharp and unaltered.",

      "question": "Is the title \"The Gray Mystery\" positioned outside the man’s face and cap area, and does it not partially cover or obscure any facial features or clothing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title 'The Gray Mystery' is placed at the bottom center of the image, directly below the man’s chin and chest area. It is positioned such that it does not intersect with his face, cap, or neck. The text begins just below the lower edge of his shirt collar and extends horizontally across the lower portion of the image. While the font size is large and bold, it remains entirely beneath the man’s physical form, avoiding any obstruction of facial features or clothing details. This placement ensures legibility and maintains visual hierarchy without compromising the visibility of the subject. Thus, the title is appropriately positioned outside the man’s head and upper body region.",

      "question": "Do the silhouettes of the cityscape and magnifying glass appear integrated into the background without intersecting or distorting the man’s head or shoulders, and do they maintain consistent depth relative to the foreground?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cityscape silhouette is located behind the man, extending from the lower right side of the image upward, with its tallest building aligned slightly behind his shoulder. The magnifying glass is placed in the upper right corner, also appearing to be in the background. Neither element overlaps or cuts through the man’s head or shoulders; instead, they are layered behind him, creating a sense of depth. The design uses transparency and shading to suggest that these elements are part of the backdrop rather than overlapping the subject. The lighting and contrast are consistent with a background layer, reinforcing the perception of depth. No distortion or clipping is visible on the man’s form where these elements are near, indicating proper layering and compositing. Hence, the silhouettes are well-integrated and maintain appropriate depth relative to the foreground.",

      "question": "Are the skin tones, facial hair, and fabric textures of the cap and shirt still visible and consistent with their original appearance, without unnatural yellowing or fading due to the sepia effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B applies a sepia tone filter to the entire composition, which shifts the color palette toward warm browns and yellows. However, despite this tonal shift, the skin tones remain distinguishable and retain their natural contours and texture. Facial hair, including the mustache and goatee, is clearly defined and shows consistent shading without over-saturation or loss of detail. The fabric texture of the cap and shirt, while subdued by the sepia effect, still displays visible weave patterns and subtle variations in shading that suggest material consistency. The sepia effect is applied uniformly, avoiding localized discoloration or unnatural fading. Although the colors are altered, the structural details of the skin, hair, and fabric remain intact and recognizable. Therefore, the key features are preserved even under the stylistic filter.",

      "question": "Does the gray cap and shirt display consistent fabric texture and weave pattern, with no visible artifacts such as blurring, noise, or unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the cap and shirt in Image B, the fabric texture appears consistent with the original material, albeit rendered in monochrome due to the sepia tone. The cap shows distinct stitching and a slight heathered texture typical of wool or cotton blends, which remains visible and coherent. Similarly, the shirt exhibits a fine knit pattern that aligns with common t-shirt materials. There are no signs of pixelation, blurring, or digital noise that might suggest compression artifacts or poor rendering. Highlights on the cap and shirt follow natural light direction and are soft and gradual, indicating proper lighting simulation rather than artificial enhancement. The overall texture is smooth and uniform, suggesting high-quality editing without introducing visual anomalies. Thus, the fabric details are preserved without degradation.",
