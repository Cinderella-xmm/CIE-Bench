    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the celestial sails replacing the elephant's ears appear to maintain a consistent size and attachment point relative to the head. The edges of the sails align smoothly with where the ears would naturally attach, and there is no visible warping or unnatural stretching of the surrounding skin. The integration seems seamless, suggesting that the artist paid attention to maintaining anatomical accuracy while incorporating fantastical elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The cosmic mist emanating from the tip of the trunk in Image B appears to be smoothly integrated into the scene. There are no jagged edges or overlapping artifacts visible, and the opacity transitions naturally, blending well with the background. This suggests careful attention to detail in creating a realistic effect for this fantastical element.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The planetary rings around the elephant's legs in Image B are evenly spaced and aligned with the limb axes. They do not clip into the leg surface or appear misaligned due to perspective. The rings seem to float just above the ground, maintaining a consistent distance from the legs, which indicates thoughtful design and alignment.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The luminescent star patterns on the elephant’s feet in Image B appear embedded within the foot surface rather than floating above it. There is no haloing or color spill onto adjacent areas, and the stars seem to be part of the foot's texture. This creates a cohesive look that integrates the magical elements seamlessly with the natural form of the elephant.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The galaxy-patterned skin in Image B follows the natural folds and creases of the elephant’s body, maintaining consistent texture resolution. There are no abrupt transitions or stretched patterns, indicating that the artist carefully mapped the cosmic design onto the elephant's anatomy. The result is a harmonious blend of fantasy and realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
