    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "The text 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' is placed above the plate, maintaining a clear separation from the plate and spoon. The placement does not overlap with the plate or spoon, preserving their visual integrity. The text size is balanced in relation to the plate and spoon, ensuring that it does not overpower the image. This suggests that the text has been integrated naturally without disrupting the overall visual balance.",

    "answer": "No"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The text sizes for 'Master Chef' and 'Final Round' are proportional to each other and appropriate in scale compared to the plate and spoon.

}

{
