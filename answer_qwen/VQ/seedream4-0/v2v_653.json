      "question": "Does the chibi version of the scientist retain the white lab coat and light blue shirt without any unnatural distortions in shape or texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi scientist is consistently depicted wearing a white lab coat over a light blue shirt across all six poses. The lab coat is stylized in a simplified, cartoonish manner typical of chibi art, but it maintains a coherent shape and color that aligns with the original clothing style seen in Image A. There are no visible distortions such as warping, stretching, or pixelation in the fabric texture. The light blue shirt is also clearly visible beneath the lab coat in each pose, with consistent shading and proportions appropriate for the chibi aesthetic. This consistency suggests that the design preserves the core visual identity of the scientist’s attire without introducing unnatural artifacts.",

      "question": "Are the scientist's beard and hair depicted naturally in the chibi style, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chibi version of the scientist in Image B does not include a beard, which is present in the original image (Image A). In chibi art, facial features like beards are often simplified or omitted entirely to maintain a cute, exaggerated style. Instead, the character has short, neatly styled brown hair with clean lines and uniform shading, typical of cartoon depictions. While the absence of a beard may be considered a simplification rather than a distortion, there are no unnatural textures or malformed shapes in the hair. The hair appears smooth and consistent with standard chibi design principles. Therefore, while the beard is not preserved, the hair is rendered naturally within the stylistic constraints of the genre.",

      "question": "Do the background elements, including the bright green color and hexagonal patterns, enhance the chibi scientist stickers without causing any visual disruption or introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a bright green gradient overlaid with faint hexagonal patterns, which resemble molecular structures or chemical motifs. These elements are subtle and do not interfere with the visibility of the sticker characters. The green color provides high contrast against the white lab coats and colorful accessories, making the stickers stand out clearly. The hexagonal patterns add thematic relevance to the scientific theme without overwhelming the foreground. There are no visual artifacts such as jagged edges, overlapping distortions, or inconsistent gradients. The overall composition enhances the playful and educational tone of the stickers, fitting well within the context of a mobile app or digital collection.",

      "question": "In all six poses, do the scientist's hands have the correct number of fingers and appear naturally shaped without any distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon examining all six poses of the chibi scientist in Image B, the hands are generally simplified in line with chibi art conventions. However, in several instances—such as the pose where the scientist holds a clipboard or the one using a microscope—the hands appear to have fewer than five fingers, or the fingers are merged into blocky shapes. This is common in chibi style, where anatomical accuracy is sacrificed for cuteness and simplicity. Despite this, none of the hands show extreme distortions like extra fingers, missing limbs, or unnatural bending. The hand shapes remain consistent with typical cartoon representations and do not introduce visual errors that would suggest technical flaws. Thus, while not anatomically precise, they are plausibly rendered within the artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the scientist's expressions and actions in all six poses coherent and visually plausible, without any unnatural or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Each of the six poses in Image B depicts the chibi scientist engaging in scientifically themed activities: holding a beaker, writing on a chalkboard, sitting cross-legged with goggles, conducting an experiment, observing a reaction, and using a microscope. All actions are coherent with the character's role as a scientist. Expressions range from surprised to focused to happy, matching the context of each activity. The facial features—large eyes, small nose, simple mouth—are consistent with chibi aesthetics and contribute to emotional clarity without distortion. There are no visible anomalies such as misaligned limbs, floating objects, or impossible physics. Even the 'explosion' sticker includes dynamic effects that are stylized but not unrealistic. Overall, the poses and expressions are logically connected to their contexts and maintain visual plausibility within the cartoon framework.",
