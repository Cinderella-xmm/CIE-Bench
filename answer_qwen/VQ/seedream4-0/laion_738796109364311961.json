      "question": "Are the muscle proportions of the player in red (player #24) exaggerated but still anatomically plausible without visible distortion or unnatural bulging?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the player in red (player #24) exhibits exaggerated muscle proportions. The muscles are significantly larger and more defined than typical human anatomy, suggesting a stylized or cartoonish approach. However, these proportions still follow basic anatomical guidelines without appearing unnaturally distorted or bulging. The visual cues such as muscle definition and placement align with common artistic exaggerations seen in sports illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the uniform colors of both players retain natural color gradients and material textures despite increased vibrancy, without appearing oversaturated or flat?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The uniform colors of both players in Image B appear vibrant but retain natural color gradients and material textures. The red and white uniforms show shading and highlights that suggest fabric texture, and the colors do not seem oversaturated or flat. This is consistent with how sports uniforms are often depicted in stylized art forms to maintain realism while enhancing visual appeal.",

      "question": "Are the team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys accurately rendered and properly aligned without deformation or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The team logos on both players' helmets and jerseys in Image B are accurately rendered and properly aligned. There is no visible deformation or pixelation; the logos are clear and sharp, which is typical for high-quality digital art. The logos maintain their integrity despite the stylistic enhancements applied to the overall image.",

      "question": "Is the background behind the players stylistically enhanced but still coherent with the foreground, without sudden distortions or loss of detail in the crowd or field markings?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background behind the players in Image B is stylistically enhanced with bright, colorful spectators and field markings. Despite the increased vibrancy, it remains coherent with the foreground. The crowd and field details are consistent and there are no sudden distortions or loss of detail, indicating a well-integrated background that complements the main subjects.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the limbs and body postures of both players maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics, even with exaggerated motion, without broken joints or floating limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The limbs and body postures of both players in Image B maintain structural consistency with real-world biomechanics. Even though the motion is exaggerated, the joints and limbs are connected logically, without any broken joints or floating limbs. The postures are dynamic yet plausible within the context of a stylized sports illustration.",

      "question": "Is the matte black collector's box with transparent lid visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective, and does it surround the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The matte black collector's box with a transparent lid in Image B is visually consistent in material, lighting, and perspective. It surrounds the cards without introducing edge artifacts or lighting mismatches. The box appears solid and realistic, fitting seamlessly into the scene as a display element for the illustrated players.",
