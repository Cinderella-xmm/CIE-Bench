    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the corners and edges of the hotel building preserved with consistent angles and proportions, and is there a clear transparent boundary (glass) enclosing the scene without warping or breaking the structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hotel building is enclosed within a transparent glass boundary. The corners and edges of the building appear to maintain consistent angles and proportions relative to the structure itself. The glass enclosure does not seem to warp or break the structural integrity of the building as it forms a seamless barrier around the scene. This conclusion is drawn by observing the straight lines and uniform appearance of the building's architecture through the glass.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the water layers in the pool show consistent transparency and refraction, allowing visibility of submerged objects and swimmers without jagged edges or color artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The water layers in the pool in Image B display consistent transparency and refraction effects. Submerged objects and swimmers are visible without jagged edges or unnatural color artifacts. The water appears smooth and clear, allowing for a realistic depiction of light passing through it. This analysis is based on the visual coherence of the water's surface and its interaction with light and objects beneath it.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the sunbathers on the lounge chairs have correctly proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, and do the nearby trees display natural leaf density and branching without pixelation or texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sunbathers on the lounge chairs in Image B have proportioned limbs and recognizable clothing details, appearing natural and well-integrated into the scene. The nearby trees also exhibit natural leaf density and branching patterns without noticeable pixelation or texture repetition. Comparing this with Image A, where similar elements are present but lack the added context of the glass enclosure, the consistency in proportions and textures is maintained in Image B.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the greenery flowing from the rooftop follow a continuous, downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points, and does it blend naturally with the building’s exterior without floating or clipping issues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The greenery flowing from the rooftop in Image B follows a continuous downward trajectory with realistic shadowing and attachment points. It blends naturally with the building’s exterior, adhering to the structure without floating or clipping issues. This assessment is made by observing how the plants integrate seamlessly with the architectural features of the building, maintaining a logical flow and realistic appearance.",

      "question": "Are the beach accessories near the pool edge correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture, and do they have natural material textures (e.g., fabric, plastic)?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The beach accessories near the pool edge in Image B are correctly sized and placed on solid ground, avoiding overlap with people or furniture. They exhibit natural material textures appropriate for items like fabric and plastic. This is evident from their placement and the way they interact with the surrounding environment, which appears coherent and free from anomalies.",

      "question": "Do the floating 3D clouds exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hover above the building without intersecting its structure, and maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floating 3D clouds in Image B exhibit soft gradients and subtle shadows, hovering above the building without intersecting its structure. They maintain consistent lighting with the rest of the scene, contributing to a harmonious and realistic atmosphere. This evaluation is based on the visual integration of the clouds with the lighting conditions and their non-intrusive positioning relative to the building.",
