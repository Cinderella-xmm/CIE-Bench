      "question": "Do the man's limbs and torso maintain proportional relationships and natural joint articulation despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man is depicted in a cartoonish, stylized manner. His limbs and torso are simplified but still follow basic human proportions. The arms are attached at the shoulders, elbows bend naturally, and the legs are proportionate to the torso with knees and ankles positioned correctly. While the style is exaggerated (e.g., larger head, simplified facial features), the joints—such as the elbows and knees—are articulated in a way that suggests natural movement. There is no visible distortion or disproportionate elongation of limbs. Based on common knowledge of human anatomy and cartoon stylization, this level of abstraction maintains plausible proportions and joint articulation. Comparing to Image A, the original photo shows realistic proportions, and the cartoon version retains those key structural relationships even if simplified.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the tuxedo and fur jacket rendered with sufficient detail and depth to appear physically plausible despite stylization?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tuxedo is represented with solid black color and minimal shading, lacking fine details such as fabric weave, lapel texture, or button highlights. The fur jacket is illustrated with a series of curved lines to suggest fluffiness, but it lacks realistic depth, volume, and variation in fur density. In real-world rendering, fur would have gradations in tone and directionality, while a tuxedo would show subtle folds and light reflections. The stylization here prioritizes simplicity over realism. Compared to Image A, where the actual textures of the suit and fur are clearly visible with material sheen and structure, the cartoon version simplifies these elements significantly. Therefore, while the garments are recognizable, they do not convey sufficient detail or depth to appear physically plausible.",

      "question": "Are the FIA logo and sponsor names clearly visible and correctly formed within the simplified linear background design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been simplified into a flat blue field with white horizontal lines and stylized versions of logos. The FIA logo appears near the top-left corner of the stamp area, and although it is abstracted, its circular shape and central 'FIA' letters are identifiable. The text 'PRIZE GIVING 2013 PARIS' is present and legible, albeit in a simplified font. Sponsor names like 'PHILIPS' and 'VOLKSWAGEN' are reduced to simple white lines, which do not resemble their actual branding. However, the core event information (FIA Prize Giving 2013) is preserved and readable. The simplification sacrifices brand accuracy but maintains essential textual content. In contrast, Image A displays full, accurate logos and sponsor names. Thus, while the key elements are visible and correctly formed in a symbolic sense, the sponsor names are not faithfully rendered.",

      "question": "Is the gold ribbon-like border fully closed, evenly shaped, and consistently thick around the entire perimeter of the stamp?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold ribbon in Image B wraps around the stamp’s border in a decorative spiral pattern. Upon close inspection, the ribbon appears continuous but does not form a perfectly closed loop—it ends abruptly at the bottom left corner without connecting back to the start. Additionally, the thickness varies slightly along its path, especially where it curves sharply. The shape is uneven due to the spiraling motion, which causes asymmetry in spacing and curvature. This inconsistency violates the expectation of a uniformly shaped, fully closed decorative border. In contrast, real-world stamps often feature symmetrical borders, and while artistic freedom allows variation, the current rendering lacks precision. Therefore, the ribbon fails to meet the criteria of being fully closed and evenly shaped.",

      "question": "Does the embossed logo on the blue envelope show consistent depth, soft shadows, and surface texture without appearing flat or artificially rendered?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embossed FIA logo on the blue envelope in Image B is rendered as a faint, circular outline with minimal shading. It lacks distinct depth cues such as raised edges or gradient shadows that would suggest physical embossing. Instead, it appears as a flat imprint with uniform opacity and no variation in tone or texture. Real embossing typically creates a three-dimensional effect through light interaction—soft shadows beneath the raised areas and highlights on the edges. Here, there are no such visual indicators. The surface texture of the envelope itself is smooth and uniform, lacking any grain or paper-like quality. This makes the logo appear digitally overlaid rather than physically embossed. Compared to Image A, which has no envelope or embossing, the digital nature of Image B’s design limits the realism of this element.",

      "question": "Is the stamp positioned with appropriate shadowing and perspective to appear physically attached to the envelope surface?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stamp is placed centrally on the envelope, and there is a subtle drop shadow beneath it, suggesting it is slightly elevated from the surface. However, the shadow is uniform and lacks variation in intensity or angle, which would be expected from a real light source casting depth. The perspective is flat, with no indication of how the stamp interacts with the envelope’s folds or creases. The stamp also appears perfectly aligned and rigid, without any warping or bending that might occur when a physical stamp is affixed. While there is an attempt at realism through shadowing, it is insufficient to create a convincing illusion of attachment. In contrast, Image A does not involve an envelope or stamp, so no direct comparison applies. But based on general principles of 3D rendering, the shadowing here is too simplistic to imply true physical attachment.",

      "question": "Do both individuals have exactly five fingers on each hand, with natural hand shapes and no deformation or missing digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the man and woman are shown with hands visible. The man’s right hand is clearly drawn with five fingers, though simplified and stylized. The woman’s left hand holds a clutch and is partially obscured, but the visible portion shows four fingers and a thumb, which aligns with five digits. However, the fingers are rounded and lack individual definition; they appear more like blobs than distinct phalanges. The overall hand shapes are not anatomically precise—they are cartoonish and exaggerated. Despite this, all five fingers are present on both hands, even if not realistically detailed. In Image A, the hands are visible and show normal finger count and shape. The stylization in Image B preserves the correct number of fingers, even if the form is not naturalistic. Therefore, based solely on digit count and presence, the answer is affirmative.",
