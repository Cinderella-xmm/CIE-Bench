      "question": "Are the facial features proportionally consistent with human anatomy, and do they maintain natural contours without exaggerated or distorted lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B depicts a stylized, cartoon-like representation of an elderly man wearing traditional Korean attire. The facial features are simplified and exaggerated in a manner typical of animated characters. For instance, the eyes are large and round, the eyebrows are thick and arched, and the nose is small and rounded—none of which reflect realistic human proportions. The cheeks are slightly flushed, and the overall face lacks the fine wrinkles and subtle skin texture seen in real aging. These characteristics are consistent with common animation styles that prioritize expressive clarity over anatomical accuracy. Therefore, while the face is recognizable as human, it does not adhere to natural human anatomy or contouring.",

      "question": "Do the gold leaf accents follow the existing pattern flow and appear integrated into the textile without unnatural highlights or floating textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the robe features intricate floral patterns with gold leaf accents on the sleeves and body. The gold elements are applied in a way that aligns with the general direction and style of the surrounding floral motifs, suggesting intentional design integration. However, due to the illustrative nature of the image, the gold areas have a flat, uniform sheen that lacks depth and variation in light reflection, which would be expected in real gold leaf applications. While the placement follows the pattern flow, the highlights appear somewhat artificial and lack the subtle gradation seen in physical textiles. This suggests the gold accents are stylized rather than realistically rendered, but they are still visually coherent with the design.",

      "question": "Are the enlarged hands anatomically accurate with five fingers each, proper joint structure, and natural skin texture without stretching or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hands in Image B are depicted in a cartoonish style. Although they show five fingers each, the joints and knuckles are simplified and lack detailed articulation. The fingers are uniformly shaped without the natural curvature or tapering seen in real hands. Additionally, the skin texture is smooth and lacks the creases, veins, and age-related imperfections present in elderly individuals. The hands appear slightly enlarged relative to the body, which is common in animation for emphasis, but this enlargement comes at the cost of anatomical precision. Thus, while the basic structure is correct (five fingers), the details are not anatomically accurate.",

      "question": "Do the floral outlines extend naturally from the robe into the indigo border without sudden breaks, inconsistent linework, or misaligned patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The floral patterns on the robe in Image B continue seamlessly into the decorative elements near the edges, particularly where the robe meets the indigo border. The outlines of the flowers and leaves follow a consistent artistic style and flow across the transition zone. There are no visible breaks, jagged lines, or misalignments between the robe’s pattern and the border. The design appears intentionally framed, with the floral motifs extending toward the edge in a harmonious fashion. This continuity suggests careful digital composition, maintaining visual coherence even at the boundary. Hence, the transition is natural and well-integrated.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the textile materials retain visible texture variation and depth, avoiding flatness or pixelation that would suggest degraded quality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The textile in Image B displays rich, layered patterns with multiple colors and designs, including floral motifs and gold accents. Despite being a digital illustration, the fabric exhibits variations in shading and color intensity that simulate depth and texture. However, because it is a stylized artwork rather than a photorealistic rendering, the texture is more graphic than tactile. There is no visible pixelation or blurring, and the details remain sharp. While the texture is not physically realistic (e.g., no woven thread detail), it maintains visual richness and avoids flatness through deliberate use of gradients and line work. Therefore, within the context of an illustrated style, the textile quality is preserved effectively.",
