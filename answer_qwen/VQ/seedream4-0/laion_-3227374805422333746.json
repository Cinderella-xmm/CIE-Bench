      "question": "Are the wooden planks on the walls seamlessly integrated with no visible gaps, misalignment, or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the wooden planks on the house's walls appear to be part of a stylized, isometric design typical of fantasy-themed board games or digital art. The planks are arranged in a consistent pattern, with visible joints and slight variations in color and shading that suggest depth and texture. There are no obvious gaps or misalignments between the planks, and the texture appears to repeat naturally across the surface, following the expected grain direction and spacing. The rendering uses subtle gradients and lighting effects to enhance realism without introducing artificial patterns. Based on visual inspection and common practices in 3D modeling and concept art, the integration of wooden planks appears seamless and well-executed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the moss texture cover only appropriate surfaces (e.g., lower stone blocks, corners) and appear layered and organic without floating or flat patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The moss in Image B is applied primarily to the lower stone sections of the house, particularly around the base and along the corners where moisture would naturally accumulate. It also appears on some wooden beams and near the ground level, which aligns with realistic growth patterns. The texture has a layered, uneven appearance with varying density, giving it an organic feel rather than a uniform or flat patch. There are no instances of moss floating above surfaces or appearing on areas unlikely to support it (like upper roof tiles). This placement and texturing reflect real-world biological behavior and artistic attention to detail in environmental storytelling.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the roof tiles, walls, and wooden elements uniformly adjusted to earthy tones without inconsistent color gradients or localized discoloration?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B consists of warm, earthy tones—reddish-brown roof tiles, beige and gray stone walls, and golden-brown wood elements. These colors are harmonious and consistent throughout the structure. The lighting creates soft shadows and highlights that enhance dimensionality without introducing unnatural discoloration. There are no abrupt shifts in hue or saturation that would suggest poor color grading. The roof tiles show variation in tone due to light interaction, but this is plausible and enhances realism. Overall, the color adjustment appears intentional and cohesive, adhering to a naturalistic aesthetic suitable for a fantasy setting.",

      "question": "Are the miniature characters correctly scaled relative to the house and positioned in plausible locations (e.g., near doors, paths) without floating or intersecting with structures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature characters in Image B are placed on a parchment-like surface in front of the house. They are proportionally smaller than the building, which is consistent with typical scale models used in tabletop games like 'Castle Quest'. Their positions—near the entrance steps and slightly apart from the house—are logical and suggest movement toward or away from the structure. None of the figures appear to float above the ground or intersect with the house; they stand firmly on the parchment. The spacing and orientation imply narrative context (e.g., approaching adventurers), which supports plausible positioning within the scene.",

      "question": "Is the parchment board positioned flat on the ground with realistic folds, texture, and shadow alignment matching the light source direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parchment board beneath the house and figures in Image B shows realistic paper texture with visible creases and curling edges, especially at the corners. The folds are not overly exaggerated but suggest natural wear and handling. Shadows cast by the parchment and objects on it extend consistently toward the right side of the image, indicating a light source from the upper left. This directional consistency matches the lighting on the house and characters, reinforcing spatial coherence. The overall presentation suggests careful attention to material simulation and environmental lighting.",

      "question": "Do the rule booklets have consistent page thickness, visible spine details, and shadows that align with the lighting and surface they rest on?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rule booklets in Image B are stacked neatly on the parchment, showing a clear sense of depth with visible page edges and slight separation between sheets. The thickness appears consistent across pages, and there are subtle spine lines suggesting binding. Shadows under the booklets fall in the same direction as those from other objects, aligning with the upper-left light source. The shadows are soft and realistic, with appropriate falloff and contact points on the parchment surface. These details indicate high-quality rendering and attention to physical realism in object representation.",
