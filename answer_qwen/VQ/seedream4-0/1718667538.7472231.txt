    "Question": "Q1: Are the edges of the tiger’s face cleanly defined with uniform thickness and no pixelated or broken lines indicating poor rendering?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the tiger's face is rendered in a stylized, paper-art aesthetic. The edges of the face are sharp and geometrically precise, consistent with a 3D papercraft design. Each line defining the contours of the face—such as the jawline, eyes, nose, and stripes—is uniformly thick and clean, without jaggedness or pixelation. This suggests high-quality digital rendering tailored to mimic physical paper cutouts. The absence of anti-aliasing artifacts or broken lines indicates that the image was carefully designed with intentional precision. Based on visual cues and knowledge of digital art techniques used in papercraft-style illustrations, the rendering quality is excellent, especially for such a complex layered object.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the exaggerated stripes and enlarged whiskers remain symmetrically aligned and proportionally consistent with the rest of the tiger’s facial structure?",
    "explanation": "The tiger’s facial features in Image B are stylized with bold, artistic exaggerations typical of papercraft or anime-inspired designs. The stripes are wide and sharply defined, but they maintain bilateral symmetry across the face—each stripe on the left mirrors its counterpart on the right in shape and placement. The whiskers are elongated and evenly spaced, extending outward from the snout in symmetrical clusters. While the proportions are not anatomically realistic (e.g., the whiskers are larger than life), they are internally consistent within the artistic style. There is no visible asymmetry or misalignment in the pattern, suggesting careful design. This symmetry aligns with common principles in decorative arts where balance is prioritized even when realism is sacrificed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the kimono panels clearly separated into distinct layers with clean edges and no overlapping or floating segments that suggest improper layering?",
    "explanation": "The kimono in Image B is depicted with multiple folded sections, particularly evident in the lower portion where detachable panels are displayed. These panels are arranged in a fan-like spread, each segment clearly delineated by crisp, angular edges. The folds between panels follow natural crease patterns consistent with fabric folding, and there is no visual evidence of floating or improperly aligned layers. The separation between each panel is maintained throughout, with no overlap or intersection that would imply incorrect layering. The use of shadow and depth cues further enhances the perception of individual, stacked layers. Given the papercraft theme, this layered construction is both stylistically appropriate and technically accurate in its representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the gold foil elements exhibit consistent reflectivity and blend naturally with the surrounding floral pattern without harsh highlights or floating fragments?",
    "explanation": "The gold foil accents on the kimono and panels in Image B are rendered with a metallic sheen that mimics real foil application. These elements have a soft, diffused glow rather than sharp specular highlights, which prevents them from appearing unnatural or overly reflective. They are integrated into the floral design with subtle gradients and edge blending, ensuring they do not float above the surface. The size and placement of the gold flowers follow the pattern of the cherry blossoms, maintaining visual harmony. No fragmented or isolated gold pieces are present, and the texture appears continuous and cohesive. This suggests skilled digital texturing, likely using normal maps or material shaders to simulate real-world foil behavior.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the detachable panels aligned with natural fold lines or garment seams and do they appear securely attached without floating or intersecting incorrectly with adjacent clothing parts?",
    "explanation": "The detachable panels in Image B are positioned at the bottom of the kimono, extending outward like an accordion or origami structure. These panels are aligned along what appear to be natural fold lines—consistent with how traditional garments might be structured for display or ceremonial purposes. The edges of the panels meet the main body of the kimono at precise angles, suggesting they are meant to be part of the garment’s design rather than externally added elements. There is no floating or clipping through adjacent parts; instead, the panels cast soft shadows and maintain spatial coherence. Their attachment appears secure, supported by the overall papercraft aesthetic where components are intentionally modular yet unified. This alignment reflects both artistic intent and structural logic in layered design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
