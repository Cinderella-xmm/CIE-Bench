      "question": "Does the parking meter maintain its structural integrity with no signs of distortion or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The parking meter in Image B appears to have a consistent and realistic texture, with no visible distortions or unusual patterns that would suggest digital manipulation. The details such as the text, stickers, and mechanical parts are clear and align with what one would expect from a real parking meter. There is no evidence of unnatural textures or warping that would indicate a loss of structural integrity.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the transition between the parking meter and the new desert highway background smooth and devoid of visible edges or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the parking meter blends seamlessly into the desert highway background without any noticeable hard edges or breaks. The lighting and shadows on the meter appear consistent with the surrounding environment, suggesting a smooth transition. This indicates careful editing to ensure the meter looks naturally placed within the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the shadows and lighting effects on the parking meter match what would be expected in a desert setting under bright sunlight?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The shadows and highlights on the parking meter in Image B are consistent with bright sunlight conditions typical of a desert. The light source appears to be high in the sky, casting short shadows and creating a glare effect on the top of the meter, which is appropriate for a sunny desert environment.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are there any irregular or unnatural shapes in the desert landscape that seem out of place or disrupt the scene's authenticity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The desert landscape in Image B appears natural and consistent with typical desert features such as sand dunes, sparse vegetation, and a clear horizon. There are no irregular shapes or elements that stand out as unnatural or disruptive to the scene's authenticity. The overall composition maintains a believable desert setting.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the parking meter appear naturally placed in the desert highway setting without looking misplaced or awkward?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "While parking meters are not commonly found in desert highways, the placement of the meter in Image B does not appear awkward or out of place given the context of the image. It is positioned along the side of the road in a manner that could be plausible if this were a designated parking area in a remote location. The meter's presence, while unusual, does not disrupt the scene's coherence.",
