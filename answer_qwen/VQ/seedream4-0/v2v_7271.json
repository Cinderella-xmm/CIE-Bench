      "question": "Are the brick textures and shapes of the building and the \"LAUNDROMAT\" sign consistent with Lego bricks, without introducing unnatural artifacts or losing fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the building's exterior wall is composed of uniformly sized, rectangular blocks with rounded edges and circular studs on their surfaces—hallmarks of Lego bricks. The color palette (beige, gray, and yellow accents) aligns with typical Lego brick colors. The 'LAUNDROMAT' sign is constructed from flat, interlocking pieces with raised lettering that mimics the style of Lego signage, including a teal baseplate and white block letters with visible stud patterns. These visual cues are consistent with Lego construction principles. Furthermore, there are no visible distortions, pixelation, or inconsistent shading that would suggest artificial artifacts. The texture and geometry remain intact, preserving the structural fidelity of Lego elements. This consistency suggests that the design adheres to Lego aesthetics without compromising detail.",

      "question": "Does the person holding the laundry appear naturally integrated into the Lego-style environment without any visible distortion or unnatural blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figure in Image B is clearly a Lego minifigure, identifiable by its blocky torso, articulated limbs, and yellow head with simplified facial features. Its hair is molded in a curved, layered style typical of Lego accessories. The figure’s proportions—such as the oversized hands and segmented limbs—are characteristic of Lego minifigures. It stands on a gray baseplate with stud patterns, which matches the floor texture and reinforces the Lego environment. There is no visible blending issue; the figure appears to be placed seamlessly within the scene, with consistent lighting and shadows that align with the surrounding elements. The integration is natural within the context of a Lego diorama, as the figure is not attempting to mimic realism but rather fits perfectly into the stylized world. No distortion or mismatched textures are evident.",

      "question": "Do the washing machines and interior elements inside the laundromat look like they are made of Lego bricks, preserving their structural integrity and avoiding broken geometric shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the laundromat, through the glass doors, two washing machines are visible. Their cylindrical drums are rendered with smooth, rounded contours, but they are constructed using Lego-like panels and circular elements that simulate the appearance of real appliances. The machine bodies are made of flat, modular bricks with visible stud patterns, consistent with Lego construction. The control panels and door frames are also built from standard Lego pieces, maintaining clean lines and geometric coherence. The floor inside appears to be tiled with small square bricks, further reinforcing the Lego aesthetic. There are no broken or misaligned shapes; all components retain their structural integrity and follow Lego design logic. While not exact replicas of real machines, they are convincingly represented within the Lego medium.",

      "question": "Does the stack of folded laundry held by the person retain its natural appearance and texture, without appearing as if it is made of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stack of folded laundry in Image B consists of five rectangular blocks in different colors (blue, pink, white, yellow, dark blue). Each block has a flat top surface with raised studs, similar to Lego plates, indicating that they are not realistic fabric but rather Lego representations of folded clothes. The edges are sharp and geometric, lacking the soft folds and wrinkles expected in real fabric. The material appears glossy and uniform, consistent with plastic Lego pieces rather than cloth. While the arrangement mimics a stack of folded towels, the texture and form are clearly stylized and artificial. Therefore, the laundry does not retain a natural appearance—it is explicitly designed to look like Lego bricks shaped like clothing.",

      "question": "Is the overall composition of the scene, including the person, the laundry, and the laundromat, coherent and visually plausible as a stop-motion diorama crafted in the style of Lego bricks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The entire scene in Image B is constructed entirely from Lego-style elements. The building, signage, flooring, character, and even the laundry are all rendered using recognizable Lego components. The lighting is consistent, casting soft shadows that enhance depth while maintaining the illusion of a physical model. The perspective is stable, and all objects scale appropriately relative to each other. The scene evokes the feel of a stop-motion animation diorama, where every element is built from modular parts. Despite the stylization, the narrative—of someone leaving a laundromat with clean clothes—is preserved and easily understood. The cohesion between the character, environment, and props supports a believable, albeit fictional, Lego world. Thus, the composition is both coherent and visually plausible within the context of a Lego-themed diorama.",
