      "question": "Do the sushi pieces forming the human figure maintain a natural and coherent structure without any visible breaks or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sushi pieces are arranged to form a human figure. The arrangement appears to be deliberate and structured, with each piece fitting together to create the shape of a person. There are no visible breaks or distortions in the structure; the pieces seem to flow naturally from one part of the body to another. This conclusion is drawn by observing the continuity and alignment of the sushi pieces.",

      "question": "Are the colors of the sushi pieces used to form the human figure consistent with the original sushi map, without any unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The colors of the sushi pieces in Image B appear consistent with typical sushi ingredients such as salmon (orange), avocado (green), and cucumber (light green). These colors are commonly found in sushi and match what would be expected. Comparing this with Image A, which uses similar colors for its sushi map, there are no noticeable unnatural color variations in Image B.",

      "question": "Are the edges of the sushi pieces forming the human figure sharp and well-defined, without any blurred or pixelated artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edges of the sushi pieces in Image B are sharp and well-defined. Each piece has clear boundaries that distinguish it from adjacent pieces. There are no signs of blurring or pixelation, indicating high image quality. This assessment is based on the visual clarity and precision of the edges observed in the image.",

      "question": "Are the sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces forming the human figure proportionate and realistic compared to the original sushi pieces, without any unnatural scaling or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sizes and shapes of the sushi pieces in Image B seem proportionate and realistic. They resemble typical sushi roll dimensions and shapes. When comparing with Image A, the pieces in both images appear similarly sized and shaped, suggesting no unnatural scaling or distortion in Image B.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm appear anatomically plausible, without any unnatural bends or angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The positioning of the sushi pieces to form the lifted arm in Image B appears anatomically plausible. The angle and bend of the arm mimic a natural human posture when lifting an arm. This conclusion is based on common knowledge of human anatomy and the way arms typically move, which aligns with the arrangement seen in the image.",
