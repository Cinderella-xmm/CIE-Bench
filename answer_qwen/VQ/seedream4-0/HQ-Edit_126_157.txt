    "Question": "Q1: Does the boat exhibit consistent aged wood texture with natural grain patterns and no repeating or unnatural surface artifacts?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the boat is rendered as part of a three-dimensional wooden sculpture. The surface of the boat shows detailed wood grain patterns that are consistent with hand-carved woodwork. The texture appears to be intentionally crafted to mimic aged wood, with visible grain lines and subtle variations in tone and depth. There are no obvious repeating patterns or artificial textures that suggest digital replication or tiling. Instead, the grain flows naturally along the contours of the boat, suggesting careful craftsmanship. Given that this is a sculptural representation rather than a photograph, the 'aged' appearance is stylistic but coherent with realistic wood carving techniques. Therefore, the texture aligns with expectations for a hand-carved wooden object, showing natural variation without unnatural artifacts.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the distant hills rendered with smooth pastel blue gradients that transition naturally without sharp boundaries or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The distant hills in Image B are depicted within a layered, stylized background that appears to be a painted or digitally rendered backdrop behind the carved figure. The hills use soft pastel blue tones that blend into one another with gradual transitions, creating a sense of atmospheric perspective. There are no sharp edges or abrupt color changes, and the gradient appears smooth and continuous. While the rendering style is not photorealistic, it adheres to artistic conventions for representing misty mountain landscapes—common in traditional East Asian art. The absence of pixelation or jagged lines suggests high-resolution rendering or careful digital painting. Thus, the visual cues support the presence of smooth, natural gradients.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are there small, clear droplet-like etchings on the water surface that resemble ripples without disrupting the reflection or causing visual distortion?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of the water surface in Image B, there are small, transparent circular elements embedded within the glass-like layer beneath the boat. These resemble droplets or bubbles and are arranged in a pattern that mimics ripples. However, they are not actual ripples but rather physical etchings or beads placed under a clear panel, likely for decorative effect. They do not distort the underlying reflection of the hills or the boat, indicating intentional design rather than optical interference. Their placement is deliberate and contributes to the illusion of movement without breaking realism. Since they are clear and evenly spaced, they serve as a stylized representation of water dynamics, consistent with artistic interpretation rather than photographic accuracy. Thus, while not true ripples, they function as visually coherent embellishments.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is there a hand-carved wooden frame surrounding the scene with realistic texture, depth, and structural coherence?",
    "explanation": "Image B features a prominent outer border that is clearly designed to resemble a hand-carved wooden frame. The frame exhibits intricate swirling patterns and organic curves typical of traditional wood carving. The texture includes visible grain, slight imperfections, and depth variations that suggest physical carving rather than flat digital rendering. The corners are mitered with precision, and the overall structure appears cohesive and three-dimensional. The lighting enhances the relief of the carvings, reinforcing the perception of real depth. This level of detail aligns with the craftsmanship expected in fine wooden frames used in display art or dioramas. Therefore, the frame is convincingly rendered as a realistic, hand-carved object.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the boat, water, and hills arranged in layered 3D cutouts with correct spatial depth and no misalignment or floating elements?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the scene is constructed as a multi-layered diorama. The boat and figure are carved from wood and positioned at the front layer, resting on a transparent base that simulates water. Behind this, the hills are represented as a painted or printed backdrop, possibly mounted on a separate plane. The layers are stacked with appropriate depth: the boat appears closer than the water surface, which is closer than the hills. There is no visual evidence of misalignment—elements are aligned horizontally and vertically, maintaining perspective consistency. The transparent layer beneath the boat allows light to pass through, enhancing the illusion of depth without introducing floating or disconnected components. The entire composition functions as a unified 3D model with proper layering and spatial logic, typical of shadow box art or relief sculptures. Thus, the arrangement demonstrates correct spatial depth and structural integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
