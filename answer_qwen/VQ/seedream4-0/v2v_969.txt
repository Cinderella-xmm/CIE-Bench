    "Question": "Q1: Do the chibi-style 3D figures inside the snow globe maintain the correct proportions and avoid unnatural geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "The chibi-style figures inside the snow globe are stylized, which is typical for this art form. They feature exaggerated heads, simplified facial features, and proportionally smaller bodies—common characteristics of chibi designs. However, despite their stylization, the figures appear balanced and symmetrical, with consistent limb proportions relative to their bodies. The helmets, uniforms, and accessories (like gloves) are appropriately scaled and positioned without any visible warping or stretching. There are no signs of geometric distortion such as skewed limbs, misaligned joints, or unnatural curvature. This suggests that while stylized, they maintain internal consistency and aesthetic coherence. From a world knowledge perspective, chibi characters often deviate from realistic proportions but should still preserve logical internal scaling. In this case, the figures do so successfully.",

    "Question": "Q2: Does the light layer of snow on the grass inside the snow globe appear natural without introducing any obvious artifacts or unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The snow inside the snow globe is depicted as a thin, soft layer covering the green grass, which is consistent with how light snowfall would naturally settle in a contained environment. The texture appears granular and slightly uneven, resembling real snowflakes rather than a smooth or overly uniform coating. There are no visible pixelation, clipping, or artificial patterns that might suggest digital artifacts. Additionally, the snow seems to accumulate more densely near the base of the figures and along the edges of the grassy area, mimicking gravity’s effect. Given that snow globes typically contain small particles suspended in liquid, the visual representation here aligns with expectations of realism within a miniature scene. No unnatural textures or rendering flaws are apparent.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Does the snow globe rest naturally on the rustic wooden shelf with soft sunlight filtering through, creating believable warm, golden reflections?",
    "explanation": "The snow globe is placed on a weathered wooden shelf that shows natural grain, slight wear, and variation in color—consistent with aged wood. The lighting in the scene suggests late afternoon sunlight, as indicated by the warm golden hue and soft shadows. Reflections on the glass surface of the snow globe are subtle and diffuse, matching the ambient light direction. These reflections include faint highlights that mimic how light interacts with curved glass surfaces. The glow around the edges of the globe and the gentle illumination on the surrounding snow and shelf enhance the sense of depth and realism. There are no harsh glares or inconsistent light sources that would break immersion. Based on common principles of lighting in photography and CGI, this setup creates a plausible and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. The interplay between light, shadow, and material textures supports a natural resting pose and convincing environmental integration.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the bats propped against the fence inside the snow globe depicted with natural textures and shapes, avoiding any distortion or unnatural appearance?",
    "explanation": "Inside the snow globe, two baseball bats are leaning against a chain-link fence. The bats have a smooth, cylindrical shape typical of wooden baseball bats, with a tapered end and a slightly thicker handle. Their texture appears matte and wood-like, consistent with real bat materials. There are no visible warps, bends, or elongations that would indicate digital distortion. The positioning of the bats—slightly angled and resting naturally against the fence—is physically plausible. The fence itself has a regular mesh pattern, and the interaction between the bats and the fence does not show clipping or floating issues. From a world knowledge standpoint, baseball bats are standardized in shape, and these representations adhere closely to that standard. No anomalies such as extra joints, irregular thickness, or unnatural curvature are present.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the transition between the interior scene of the snow globe and the vintage baseball clubhouse backdrop smooth, without any visible artifacts or breaks in continuity?",
    "explanation": "The background behind the snow globe features a vintage-style baseball clubhouse labeled 'TWINS,' with faded signage and weathered walls. The image uses a shallow depth of field, blurring the background slightly to emphasize the snow globe in the foreground. This technique helps create a sense of depth and separation between the two elements. The lighting and color grading across both the globe and the backdrop are harmonious—warm tones dominate, and there is no abrupt change in hue or contrast at the boundary. There are no visible seams, jagged edges, or digital artifacts where the globe meets the background. Furthermore, the reflection on the glass subtly captures parts of the background, enhancing the illusion of transparency and continuity. In digital compositing, achieving seamless transitions requires careful blending and lighting matching; here, the result appears professionally executed. Thus, the transition is visually smooth and coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
