    "Question": "Q1: Does the digital display screen appear to fit seamlessly within the rectangular frame previously occupied by the painting, maintaining the same proportions and alignment?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the digital display screen is mounted on the wall in a position that aligns with the center of the wall space where the painting was located in Image A. The screen's dimensions are similar to those of the original framed painting, suggesting it occupies the same spatial footprint. The top, bottom, and side margins relative to the surrounding wall appear consistent with the original painting’s placement. The alignment is symmetrical with respect to the two armchairs below, which remain equidistant from the centerline of the wall. Based on visual cues such as edge positioning and proportional scaling, the screen appears to be placed in the same location and maintains the same proportions as the previous artwork. This suggests a seamless replacement without altering the overall composition or balance of the room.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the texture and surface finish of the digital display screen consistent with the surrounding wall, ensuring it does not introduce any unnatural artifacts or discrepancies in material?",
    "explanation": "The digital display screen in Image B has a flat, glossy black bezel and a dark blue illuminated surface, which contrasts sharply with the matte white wall behind it. While the screen itself is a modern electronic device, its integration into the wall is clean and unobtrusive—there are no visible seams, cracks, or distortions around the edges. However, the surface finish of the screen is inherently different from the wall: the wall is matte and uniform, while the screen has a reflective, high-contrast surface. In real-world scenarios, a digital display would typically have a distinct material appearance compared to drywall or painted surfaces, so some level of contrast is expected. But since the screen is flush-mounted and there are no visible artifacts (e.g., warping, mismatched textures, or lighting inconsistencies), it integrates well despite the material difference. The absence of unnatural artifacts indicates careful rendering or installation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are all the details around the digital display screen, such as the wall edges and the flooring, preserved without any visible distortion or loss of detail?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of Image B, the wall edges adjacent to the digital display screen appear smooth and continuous, with no signs of blurring, stretching, or pixelation. The baseboard at the bottom of the wall meets the floor cleanly, and the transition between the wall and the wooden flooring is sharp and consistent. There is no visible distortion in the wood grain or shadowing near the screen's perimeter. The corners of the screen are crisp, and the surrounding wall shows no irregularities such as color bleeding or texture loss. These observations suggest that the editing process preserved fine details around the screen. Comparing this to Image A, the same architectural elements (baseboard, wall texture, floor) remain unchanged in quality and clarity, indicating that the replacement of the painting with the screen did not compromise the integrity of surrounding details.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the digital display screen preserve the balance and symmetry of the room, with the armchairs still appearing naturally aligned relative to the new display screen?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the two armchairs are positioned symmetrically on either side of the central axis of the wall, just as they were in Image A. The digital display screen is centered on the wall, directly above the midpoint between the chairs, preserving the original spatial symmetry. The distance from each chair to the centerline remains equal, and their orientation toward the screen suggests intentional placement for viewing. The screen’s width and height are proportionate to the chairs and wall, contributing to a balanced composition. From a design perspective, symmetry is maintained, and the visual weight of the screen is comparable to the original painting in terms of scale and placement. Therefore, the room retains its sense of harmony and order despite the change in wall content.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the shadows and light reflections cast by the digital display screen match those expected from a wall-mounted object, without creating unrealistic or conflicting lighting patterns?",
    "explanation": "The digital display screen in Image B casts minimal shadow, which is consistent with a thin, flush-mounted panel on a flat wall. There is a subtle soft shadow beneath the bottom edge of the screen, suggesting depth and slight protrusion from the wall, which is realistic for a modern TV or monitor. The lighting in the room appears even and diffused, likely from ambient overhead sources, and there are no harsh glares or reflections on the screen surface that would indicate direct light interference. The screen itself emits light, but this is internally generated and does not affect the surrounding environment in an unnatural way. The reflection on the screen is consistent with a glossy surface under indoor lighting. No conflicting shadows or highlights are present that would suggest misalignment with the room’s lighting setup. Overall, the lighting behavior of the screen is plausible and matches expectations for a wall-mounted digital display.",
    "answer": "Yes"
