      "question": "Does the sofa maintain its structural integrity and proportions from both the front and side views, avoiding any unusual geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the sofa is shown in both a front view and a side view. The structure of the sofa appears consistent with typical furniture design, maintaining straight lines and proportional dimensions. There are no visible distortions or irregularities that would suggest a loss of structural integrity. The side view complements the front view by showing the depth and continuity of the sofa's form.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the fabric textures and details of the sofa consistent and clear in both the front and side views, without any visible loss of detail or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fabric texture on the sofa in Image B appears uniform and realistic in both views. The material looks smooth and consistent, with no noticeable differences or anomalies between the front and side perspectives. This suggests that the editing process has preserved the fabric's details effectively.",

      "question": "Do the cushions and legs of the sofa align naturally between the front and side views, maintaining visual plausibility and coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cushions and legs of the sofa in Image B align well between the two views. In the front view, the cushions are evenly placed, and this arrangement is logically continued in the side view, where the depth and placement of the cushions appear natural. The legs are also consistently positioned under the sofa, supporting its weight in a believable manner.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the light and shadow effects on the sofa and surrounding area remain consistent and natural when transitioning from the front to the side view?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B creates a natural play of light and shadow across the sofa and its surroundings. The shadows cast by the sofa and the cushions are consistent with the direction of the light source, which seems to come from the left side. This consistency is maintained as the perspective shifts from front to side, enhancing the realism of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the artwork on the wall and the wall itself retain their natural appearance and realism when viewed from both the front and side perspectives?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The artwork and the wall in Image B appear natural and undistorted in both views. The painting maintains its vibrant colors and swirling patterns, and there are no visible inconsistencies or alterations that detract from its realism. The wall serves as a neutral backdrop that complements the artwork, and its appearance remains consistent between the two perspectives.",
