      "question": "Are the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) aligned and proportionally consistent with each other, without any visible stretching or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the facial features of the plush toy are simple and stylized. The eyes are round and symmetrical, placed evenly on either side of the face. The nose is a small dot centered between the eyes, and the mouth is a curved line below the nose. There is no indication of stretching or distortion as the features maintain a consistent size and spacing relative to each other. This analysis is based on observing the symmetry and proportions typical for plush toys.",

      "question": "Does the hair appear voluminous and fluffy with natural strands and flow, without flat patches or artificial layering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hair in Image B appears voluminous and fluffy, with strands that seem to flow naturally. There are no flat patches or signs of artificial layering; instead, the hair gives an impression of being soft and textured, which is characteristic of plush materials designed to mimic natural hair. This conclusion is drawn from the visual texture and distribution of the hair strands.",

      "question": "Are the black vertical stripes on the sweater rendered as continuous, evenly spaced stitches without jagged edges or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black vertical stripes on the sweater in Image B are indeed continuous and evenly spaced. They appear as neat stitches running down the front of the sweater, with no visible jagged edges or gaps. This observation aligns with common stitching techniques used in plush toys to create a uniform pattern.",

      "question": "Is the body shape uniformly rounded and soft, without sharp edges or irregular protrusions that would disrupt the plush appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The body of the plush toy in Image B is uniformly rounded and soft, maintaining a smooth contour throughout. There are no sharp edges or irregular protrusions that would detract from its plush appearance. This assessment is based on the overall silhouette and texture of the toy, which are consistent with the design of soft, cuddly objects.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the transitions between the fur of the hair and the fabric of the sweater smooth and consistent, without visible seams or texture mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition between the fur of the hair and the fabric of the sweater in Image B appears smooth and consistent. There are no visible seams or texture mismatches that would indicate a separation between the two materials. This suggests a seamless integration typical of well-crafted plush toys where different materials are joined seamlessly.",
