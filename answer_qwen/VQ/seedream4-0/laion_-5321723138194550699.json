      "question": "Are the black ink outlines around the car's body, wheels, and wing consistently sharp and aligned with the underlying shapes without breaking or overlapping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the car is rendered in a comic book style, characterized by bold black outlines. Observing the edges of the car’s body, wheels, and wing, the outlines appear uniformly thick and sharply defined. They follow the contours of the vehicle precisely, maintaining alignment with the underlying shapes. There are no visible breaks, gaps, or overlaps where the outline crosses over itself or fails to meet at corners. This consistency is typical of high-quality comic art, where clean linework is essential for clarity and visual impact. Based on this analysis, the outlines are well-executed.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the halftone dots on the car’s side panels and wing appear evenly spaced and consistent in density without visible banding or irregular clustering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Halftone patterns are used in Image B to simulate shading and texture in the comic style. Upon close inspection of the car’s side panels and wing, the halftone dots are generally uniform in size and spacing, particularly in areas like the gray sections of the bodywork. However, there is some variation in dot density near transitions between colors and shadows, which is common in stylized illustrations. While minor inconsistencies may exist due to artistic interpretation, there is no significant banding or clumping that would suggest poor rendering. The pattern appears intentional and consistent enough to support the comic aesthetic.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the dominant colors on the car (such as the wing and side panels) now rendered in muted orange, cream, and deep gray without any residual bright or unnatural hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B has been adjusted to match a vintage comic book aesthetic. The original vibrant orange from Image A has been toned down into a muted, earthy orange. The gray areas are darker and more desaturated, resembling deep gray rather than metallic silver. Cream tones replace white or light areas, contributing to an aged paper feel. These shifts align with the goal of creating a retro comic look. There are no bright or unnatural colors remaining; instead, all hues are subdued and harmonious with the overall style. This transformation is consistent with traditional comic printing techniques using limited color palettes.",

      "question": "Are the motion lines behind the car straight, evenly spaced, and aligned with the direction of travel without curving or intersecting improperly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The motion lines in Image B are drawn behind the car to convey speed and movement. They are diagonal, extending backward from the rear of the vehicle, consistent with forward motion. The lines are mostly straight and evenly spaced, suggesting a uniform velocity. While some slight variations in spacing occur, they do not disrupt the sense of motion. Importantly, none of the lines curve unnaturally or intersect each other incorrectly. Their alignment matches the car’s trajectory, reinforcing the dynamic feel of the scene. This use of motion lines is standard in comic art for depicting speed.",

      "question": "Is the speech bubble containing “VROOM!” located above the car, fully visible, and free from overlap with the car’s wing or other structural elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble with 'VROOM!' is positioned prominently above the car in Image B. It is clearly visible and does not overlap with any part of the vehicle, including the wing or roll cage. Its jagged shape and placement are typical of comic sound effects, designed to emphasize action. The bubble floats freely in the space above the car, ensuring legibility and visual separation from the main subject. No clipping or obstruction occurs, making it fully accessible and effective as a visual cue.",

      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Has the background behind the car been simplified into flat or textured blocks without retaining detailed figures or structures that conflict with the comic style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been significantly altered from the original photograph. Instead of showing a crowd and fencing as in Image A, the background consists of flat beige tones with subtle halftone textures, mimicking the appearance of old comic pages. All detailed elements such as spectators, barriers, and grass have been removed or abstracted into simple shapes and patterns. This simplification aligns perfectly with the comic book aesthetic, where backgrounds are often minimized to focus attention on the action. There are no conflicting realistic details present.",

      "question_id": "Q7",
      "question": "Are the car’s wheels properly aligned with the axles, and do the suspension arms maintain correct angles and connections without bending or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels in Image B are depicted in a way that preserves their mechanical relationship to the axles. Each wheel is centered on its axle and maintains a proper orientation relative to the chassis. The suspension arms, though stylized, retain accurate angular relationships—there is no visible bending, stretching, or misalignment that would suggest deformation. The geometry of the suspension system remains plausible within the context of the illustration style. Even with the cartoonish exaggeration, the engineering logic of the vehicle’s undercarriage is respected.",

      "question": "Are the sponsor logos on the car’s wing and body still recognizable and legible despite the comic-style treatment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite the stylization in Image B, several sponsor logos remain identifiable. Logos such as 'American Express,' 'Bobcat,' 'Logan,' 'Royal Flooring,' and 'Aspen Tire Inc.' are clearly visible on the wing and side panels. While the text is slightly simplified and integrated into the comic art style, the lettering is still readable and distinct. The font choices and layout preserve brand recognition, even with reduced contrast and added halftone effects. This balance between artistic style and legibility is crucial in commercial illustrations and has been successfully achieved here.",
