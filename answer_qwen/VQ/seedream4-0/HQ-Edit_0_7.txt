    "Question": "Q1: Does the chibi-style parrot maintain smooth feather textures and proportional body parts without visible warping or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the chibi-style parrot is rendered in a stylized, cartoonish manner with exaggerated features typical of chibi art. The feathers are depicted with smooth, clean gradients and distinct color segments (red, yellow, blue), which are consistent with digital illustration techniques used to simulate texture without actual fine detail. There is no visible pixelation or jagged edges, indicating high-resolution rendering. The body proportions—such as the large head, small limbs, and rounded form—are intentional stylistic choices in chibi design, not signs of warping. These elements align with common practices in character design where realism is sacrificed for cuteness and visual appeal. Thus, despite being stylized, the parrot maintains visual integrity without technical flaws.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the oversized leaves around the branch proportionally larger than surrounding foliage without appearing stretched or unnaturally shaped?",
    "explanation": "The leaves inside the glass dome in Image B are clearly larger than typical foliage found in natural rainforest settings, but this exaggeration serves an aesthetic purpose in diorama design, where scale can be manipulated for visual impact. However, their shapes—especially the broad, heart-shaped leaves with natural veining and dewdrops—are anatomically plausible and not distorted. They appear slightly enlarged but not stretched or warped; instead, they follow realistic botanical forms. In comparison to real-world plant morphology, such leaves could represent species like Monstera or philodendrons, which naturally have large leaves. The proportions relative to the parrot and branch suggest intentional artistic scaling rather than error. Therefore, while oversized, they do not exhibit unnatural stretching or deformation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the crystal beads on the leaves appear as clear, spherical droplets with subtle reflections and no visible digital artifacts or smudging?",
    "explanation": "The crystal beads on the leaves in Image B are rendered as transparent, spherical droplets with highlights and internal refractions that mimic light behavior in real water droplets. Each bead shows soft specular reflections and slight distortion of background elements, consistent with how light interacts with curved surfaces. There are no visible pixelation, blurring, or smudging, suggesting high-quality rendering. The placement and size of the beads vary naturally across the leaves, enhancing realism. Digital artifacts such as halos or aliasing are absent, indicating careful post-processing. This level of detail suggests professional-grade image generation with attention to photorealistic effects, even within a stylized context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the explorer positioned on a separate branch at a believable distance and scale, with correct limb orientation and no distortion in form?",
    "explanation": "The explorer figure in Image B is placed on a smaller branch adjacent to the main perch, maintaining a spatial separation from the parrot. Its scale is significantly smaller than the parrot, which is consistent with the miniature nature of the diorama. The figure’s posture—sitting upright with arms bent over a notebook—is anatomically accurate and logically oriented for sketching. Limb proportions are preserved, and there is no visible warping or stretching. The positioning appears intentional to create depth and narrative context (a scientist observing wildlife). While the overall scene is fantastical, the explorer's form adheres to basic principles of human anatomy and perspective, fitting well within the scaled environment. No distortions are evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the base of the glass dome feature a consistent wood texture with etched tribal patterns that blend naturally into the rainforest setting without sharp edges or lighting inconsistencies?",
    "explanation": "The wooden base of the glass dome in Image B displays a detailed grain pattern consistent with polished hardwood, likely designed to evoke a natural, rustic feel appropriate for a jungle-themed display. The etched tribal patterns along the edge are evenly spaced and symmetrical, resembling traditional Indigenous motifs often associated with tropical regions. These carvings integrate smoothly into the wood surface without abrupt transitions or artificial-looking lines. Lighting across the base is uniform, with soft shadows and highlights that suggest ambient illumination from above, matching the outdoor setting. There are no visible seams, harsh contrasts, or digital artifacts, indicating seamless integration of material textures and lighting. The overall appearance is cohesive and enhances the thematic immersion of the diorama.",
    "answer": "Yes"
