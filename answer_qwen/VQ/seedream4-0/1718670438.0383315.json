      "question": "Does the glass bell jar surrounding the robot have clear, smooth surfaces with natural reflections and refractions that do not distort the robot’s structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass bell jar in Image B appears to be made of transparent, high-quality glass with a smooth, curved surface. The reflections on the glass are subtle and consistent with how light interacts with such a material—there are soft highlights and faint distortions due to curvature, but these are minimal and realistic. The robot inside is clearly visible without any significant warping or unnatural bending of its features, indicating that the refractive properties of the glass are accurately rendered. Natural refraction would slightly bend light, but in this case, the effect is mild and plausible for a dome-shaped glass enclosure. There are no sharp edges, smudges, or artificial-looking glares, which supports the conclusion that the glass has been realistically modeled. This aligns with real-world physics where glass domes can introduce slight distortion but generally preserve structural clarity.",

      "question": "Is the pedestal under the robot properly aligned, proportionally sized, and made of materials consistent with the steampunk theme (e.g., brass, copper) without visible seams or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pedestal beneath the robot in Image B is circular, metallic, and features gear-like edges at its base, which are characteristic of steampunk design. Its material appears to be a dark brass or copper alloy, consistent with the color and texture of the robot itself. The pedestal is well-aligned with the central axis of the robot and the glass dome, showing no tilting or misalignment. It is proportionally sized—large enough to support the robot and the surrounding gadgets without appearing oversized or undersized. There are no visible seams, cracks, or deformations; the surface is smooth with detailed engravings that match the mechanical aesthetic. The craftsmanship suggests it was designed as an integrated part of the display, reinforcing the thematic coherence. Given the visual consistency and lack of flaws, it is safe to conclude that the pedestal is both structurally sound and stylistically appropriate.",

      "question": "Are the miniature clockwork gadgets and copper wire coils positioned at a plausible scale and orientation around the robot, with natural textures and no floating or disconnected parts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, several small mechanical components surround the robot’s base: a tiny clock, coiled copper wires, a small glass bulb, and other intricate gears. These objects are scaled appropriately relative to the robot, suggesting they are decorative or functional accessories rather than full-sized machines. Their placement is deliberate and balanced—each item rests on the base, anchored by physical contact with the platform or other components. The copper coils are tightly wound and exhibit realistic textures, with slight variations in thickness and patina that suggest authenticity. No object appears to be floating or suspended without support. The clock face is legible and oriented correctly, and the wiring connects logically to nearby elements. The overall arrangement reflects a curated display typical of steampunk dioramas, where every piece contributes to the narrative of mechanical ingenuity. Thus, the positioning and appearance of these gadgets are plausible and coherent.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the glowing orbs emit a soft, localized glow that blends naturally with the ambient lighting and does not produce unnatural light artifacts or overexposed areas?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing orbs in Image B are small, warm-toned lights placed near the base of the robot and among the clockwork gadgets. They emit a soft, diffused glow that illuminates nearby surfaces gently, creating subtle highlights on the metal components and glass dome. The light sources do not cause harsh shadows or bright spots that would indicate overexposure; instead, their illumination enhances the moody, atmospheric lighting typical of steampunk scenes. The glow appears to originate from within the orbs themselves, with no visible lens flare or digital artifacting. The ambient lighting is dim and warm, matching the rusted background, and the orbs contribute to this mood without overpowering it. This indicates careful rendering of light behavior—realistic diffusion and falloff—consistent with physical light sources like small bulbs or incandescent filaments. Therefore, the lighting is natural and well-integrated.",

      "question": "Are the etched patterns on the base of the glass jar sharp, detailed, and stylistically coherent with the steampunk aesthetic, without blurring or irregular lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base of the glass jar in Image B features engraved designs including gears, cogs, and mechanical motifs commonly associated with steampunk art. These patterns are clearly defined, with clean lines and consistent depth, suggesting precise engraving. The details are sharp and evenly spaced, showing no signs of blurring, pixelation, or uneven strokes. The style is cohesive with the rest of the scene—matching the ornate, industrial design language seen in the robot and pedestal. The etchings appear to be recessed into the metal, with slight shadowing that adds dimensionality, enhancing their realism. Such detailing is typical of handcrafted or machine-etched metalwork in themed collectibles. There are no irregularities in line weight or spacing, which would suggest poor rendering or design. Hence, the etching quality is high and thematically appropriate.",

      "question": "Does the rusted metal background match the color and texture of the robot’s materials and blend seamlessly without visible edges or tonal inconsistencies?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of a heavily rusted metal surface with a rich, textured appearance featuring orange-brown corrosion, patches of peeling paint, and pitted areas. This texture complements the brass and copper tones of the robot and its surroundings, creating a cohesive industrial atmosphere. The color palette is harmonious—the rusty reds and browns of the wall echo the metallic hues of the robot and pedestal. There are no abrupt transitions or visible edges between the background and the foreground elements, indicating a seamless integration. The lighting on the background matches the ambient glow, with subtle gradients that enhance depth without introducing tonal mismatches. The overall effect is one of continuity, as if the entire scene exists within the same decaying, mechanical environment. This level of visual harmony suggests intentional design and high-quality rendering, ensuring that the background enhances rather than distracts from the subject.",
