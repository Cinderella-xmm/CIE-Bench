      "question": "Do the luminous panels follow the exact shape and curvature of the original headâ€™s surface without visible gaps or overlapping seams?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the luminous panels appear to be part of a digital structure rather than following the curvature of a head. The panels are rectangular and flat, with sharp edges that do not conform to any organic shape. There are no visible gaps or overlapping seams between the panels as they are designed to fit together in a grid-like fashion. This analysis is based on the visual cues of the panels' geometry and arrangement.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the neon animations on the digital panels displayed with sharp, continuous light patterns and no pixelated or fragmented sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The neon animations on the digital panels in Image B exhibit sharp and continuous light patterns. The lines and shapes within the panels are smooth and well-defined, indicating high-resolution graphics. There are no signs of pixelation or fragmentation, suggesting that the animations are rendered with sufficient detail to maintain clarity.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Does the synthetic foliage emit a soft, even glow from within, and do the individual plant forms have defined structure and depth without appearing like flat decals?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The synthetic foliage in Image B does emit a soft, even glow, likely due to the lighting effects applied to the scene. The individual plant forms have defined structures and depth, as indicated by the shadows and highlights that give them a three-dimensional appearance. They do not appear as flat decals but rather as integrated elements of the environment.",

      "question": "Do the metallic surfaces of the surrounding buildings show accurate reflections and subtle surface variations without distorted grid patterns or stretched textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic surfaces of the buildings in Image B display accurate reflections and subtle surface variations. The reflections are consistent with the light sources in the scene, and there are no distorted grid patterns or stretched textures visible. The surfaces appear smooth and realistic, contributing to the overall quality of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the transformed head and pedestal aligned correctly with the horizon and surrounding buildings, showing no angular distortion or perspective mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the digital structure replaces the head and pedestal from Image A. The alignment of this new structure with the horizon and surrounding buildings appears correct, maintaining a consistent perspective. There is no noticeable angular distortion or perspective mismatch, suggesting that the transformation was executed with attention to spatial coherence.",
