      "question": "Are the body proportions and movements in the line art consistent and natural throughout the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character's body proportions appear consistent across all four frames. The limbs and torso maintain a realistic human scale relative to each other. Movements transition smoothly from preparation to follow-through, suggesting a natural sequence of actions typical in sports like tennis. Each frame captures a plausible stage of a forehand swing, with no disproportionate or awkward postures.",

      "question": "Do the tennis racket and the ball retain their realistic textures and details without introducing any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tennis racket and ball in Image B are depicted in a stylized manner consistent with line art. They lack detailed textures but this is expected in such an artistic style. There are no visible artifacts that would suggest distortion or errors. The simplicity of the design aligns with the overall aesthetic, maintaining clarity and realism within the context of the illustration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the hand's position and grip on the racket depicted naturally and ergonomically in each of the four frames?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand's position on the racket appears ergonomic and natural in all four frames. In each stage of the swing, the fingers are wrapped around the handle in a way that mimics how a player would grip a racket during a forehand stroke. This consistency supports the believability of the action sequence.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the removal of the background and the application of monochrome colors preserve visual clarity without causing any distortion or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The removal of the background and use of monochrome colors in Image B enhance focus on the subject without causing distortion. The simplified color scheme does not obscure details; instead, it highlights the character and his actions clearly. The lines defining the figure and objects remain sharp and distinct, preserving visual clarity.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the sequence of actions from preparation to follow-through in the clean line art style visually coherent and believable?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sequence of actions in Image B flows logically from preparation to follow-through. Each frame builds upon the previous one, showing a gradual progression of the forehand swing. The transitions between frames are smooth, and the final pose suggests a natural completion of the movement, making the entire sequence visually coherent and believable.",
