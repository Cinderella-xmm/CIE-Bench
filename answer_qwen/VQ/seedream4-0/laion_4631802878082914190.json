    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are the animal characters positioned directly over the original locations of the process boxes without shifting or overlapping neighboring elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the animal characters are placed over stones labeled with process names such as 'Business Understanding,' 'Preparation,' etc. These stones appear to be positioned in a way that corresponds to where the original process boxes would have been in a typical diagram. There is no visible overlap or shifting into neighboring elements, suggesting they are directly over the original locations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the playful paths between characters form a continuous, unbroken winding route that follows the circular structure of the original diagram without abrupt turns or gaps?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The paths between the characters in Image B form a continuous route that follows a circular structure. The paths are winding and connect each character sequentially without any abrupt turns or gaps, maintaining the flow of the original circular diagram's structure.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the central cluster of glowing data crystals positioned at the center of the diagram and scaled appropriately so it does not dominate or shrink the surrounding characters?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central cluster of glowing data crystals is indeed positioned at the center of the diagram in Image B. It is scaled appropriately so that it does not dominate the surrounding space nor shrink the characters around it, ensuring balance within the composition.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the speech bubbles placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements, and do they contain legible text that is consistent in font and size?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are placed near each character without overlapping them or other elements. The text inside the speech bubbles is legible, consistent in font, and size, making it easy to read and understand the messages being conveyed by the characters.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Do the animal characters display realistic limb positions and interactions with props (e.g., magnifying glass, laptop, clipboard) that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The animal characters in Image B display limb positions and interactions with props that conform to known anatomy and ergonomics. For example, the owl holding a magnifying glass and the raccoon using a laptop are depicted in realistic postures that align with their respective anatomies.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Are all elements (characters, paths, background, text) rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation, avoiding mismatched textures or sudden changes in style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "All elements in Image B, including characters, paths, background, and text, are rendered with consistent line art, shading, and color saturation. There are no mismatched textures or sudden changes in style, contributing to a cohesive and visually harmonious image.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The title banner in Image B is located at the top edge of the image and is fully visible. It does not overlap any part of the diagram or characters, ensuring clear visibility and separation from the rest of the content.",
