      "question": "Does the character seamlessly integrate into the tablet screen without any visible gaps or unnatural edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu appears to be emerging from the tablet screen, with a glowing effect around its feet and the screen. The visual design includes light rays and a shimmering aura that suggest an illusion of the character stepping out of the digital world. The edges of Pikachu’s lower body align closely with the screen's boundary, and there is no visible gap between the character and the tablet. This integration uses common visual techniques in digital art to create a 'breaking through' effect, such as light distortion and partial transparency. From a world knowledge perspective, such effects are frequently used in promotional materials for interactive games (e.g., Pokémon GO) to convey immersion. The seamless transition is further supported by the reflection and glow on the tablet surface, which enhances the illusion. Therefore, the integration appears intentional and well-executed.",

      "question": "Are the character's arms positioned naturally as if reaching out, without any distortion or unusual angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu’s arms are raised upward and slightly outward, forming a joyful, celebratory pose. The arms appear symmetrical and proportionate to the body, with no visible stretching, bending, or warping. The positioning suggests an energetic movement consistent with the character’s cheerful expression. Comparing this to typical depictions of Pikachu in official media (such as anime or games), this arm posture is common during moments of excitement or greeting. There is no indication of unnatural angles or distortion; the limbs maintain their expected shape and alignment. Thus, the arms are positioned naturally within the context of the character’s expressive gesture.",

      "question": "Do the character's legs extend naturally from the tablet, maintaining proper proportions and avoiding any broken or distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, Pikachu’s legs are shown extending downward from the tablet screen, with both feet clearly visible and aligned with the character’s body. The legs maintain consistent proportions relative to the rest of the body, and there is no evidence of clipping, breaking, or unnatural deformation. The use of lighting and shadow beneath the feet adds depth and supports the illusion of the character stepping out of the screen. In contrast to potential errors in digital compositing (like floating limbs or misaligned joints), the legs here appear solid and continuous. Based on world knowledge of graphic design principles, such continuity is essential for believable 3D-like effects. Therefore, the legs are rendered naturally and coherently.",

      "question": "Has the character's facial expression remained consistent, without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Pikachu’s facial features in Image B—large black eyes, red cheeks, open mouth showing a pink tongue, and a smiling expression—are consistent with its canonical design across official Pokémon media. The details are sharp, colors are vibrant, and there are no pixelation, blurring, or texture artifacts. The expression conveys joy and energy, matching the overall theme of the image. Compared to Image A, which shows a similar expression but in a simpler 2D format, Image B retains all key facial elements while enhancing them with subtle shading and highlights. No distortions or unnatural textures are present, indicating high-quality rendering. Thus, the facial expression remains faithful and detailed.",

      "question": "Does the tablet fit naturally within the composition of the image, contributing to a coherent and authentic interactive entertainment effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tablet in Image B is depicted as a modern, sleek device with realistic design elements such as a black bezel, silver frame, and red side buttons—consistent with Apple iPad models. It is angled slightly to provide depth and perspective, and it displays a colorful game interface featuring Pikachu, reinforcing the theme of interactive play. The glowing effect around Pikachu and the alignment of the character with the screen content create a sense of emergence, suggesting augmented reality or immersive gameplay. This setup mirrors real-world marketing strategies for mobile gaming apps, where characters appear to 'pop out' of devices to engage users. The composition is balanced, with the tablet serving as a logical anchor point for the character’s appearance. Hence, the tablet integrates naturally and enhances the authenticity of the interactive entertainment concept.",
