    "Question": "Q1: Are the crystal facets on the truck's cabin and body uniformly shaped and aligned with the original panel lines, without visible breaks or misaligned edges?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the truck has been transformed into a crystalline sculpture composed of numerous faceted gem-like surfaces. The facets appear to follow the general contours and structural divisions of the original vehicle, such as the cab, fenders, and cargo box. However, upon closer inspection, the facets are not perfectly uniform in shape or size—some are larger or more angular than others—and they do not strictly align with the original panel lines of the vehicle. Instead, they seem to be artistically arranged to mimic the form rather than precisely replicate the mechanical design. There are visible breaks and irregularities at the junctions between different sections (e.g., where the cab meets the cargo area), suggesting intentional artistic abstraction rather than precise replication. This deviation from exact alignment indicates that while the overall shape is preserved, the crystal facets are not uniformly shaped or perfectly aligned with the original panel lines.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the transparent quartz wheels maintain the same size, spacing, and axle alignment as the original muddy wheels, with no floating or misplaced components?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the wheels have been replaced with transparent, faceted crystal structures resembling quartz. While they retain the general circular shape and relative positioning of the original wheels, their size appears slightly enlarged compared to the original muddy tires, particularly in the front. The spacing between the wheels seems consistent with the original vehicle’s wheelbase, but the crystal wheels are mounted on a clean, reflective platform, which alters the perception of ground contact. Importantly, the rear dual wheels are now depicted as two separate crystal units, but their alignment with the axles appears accurate. However, due to the material transformation, the wheels lack physical grounding in the dirt like the original, giving them a 'floating' appearance above the marble base. This visual effect suggests that although the spatial arrangement is roughly correct, the wheels are not physically anchored in the same way, leading to a sense of detachment from the ground. Therefore, despite maintaining approximate size and spacing, the wheels exhibit a floating quality due to the new context.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the quartz wheels internally detailed with natural-looking crystal lattice structures that follow the shape of the original hubs and rims, without jagged or inconsistent lines?",
    "explanation": "The quartz wheels in Image B are highly stylized and composed of geometric facets that reflect light in a prismatic manner. Internally, these wheels feature intricate patterns that resemble crystal lattices, with symmetrical arrangements mimicking the hub and rim structure of the original vehicle. However, these internal details are not entirely naturalistic—they consist of sharp, angular planes rather than organic or continuous lattice formations found in real quartz. The lines within the crystals are consistent and deliberate, but they appear more like engineered cut surfaces than naturally occurring mineral structures. While the overall shape follows the original hub and rim design, the internal detailing leans toward artistic interpretation rather than realistic representation. Some edges near the center of the wheels show slight inconsistencies in facet alignment, contributing to a slightly jagged appearance in certain lighting angles. Thus, while the wheels are well-designed, they do not fully capture the subtle complexity of natural crystal lattices.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the white marble platform flat, continuous, and properly supporting the entire underside of the crystal truck, with no visible gaps or floating sections?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the crystal truck rests on a large, white marble platform that appears smooth and polished. The surface is flat and continuous across its visible extent, extending beneath the full length of the vehicle. The reflection of the truck on the platform suggests it is highly reflective and level. Upon close examination, there are no visible gaps between the underside of the crystal truck and the platform—the entire undercarriage appears to be in contact with the surface. The platform also supports all parts of the truck, including the wheels and chassis, without any indication of floating or unsupported sections. The seamless integration of the truck onto the platform, combined with the mirror-like finish, reinforces the impression of solid support. Given the artistic nature of the piece, this setup ensures stability and aesthetic harmony. Therefore, based on visual evidence and common expectations for display platforms, the marble base is effectively flat, continuous, and fully supportive.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do the crystal surfaces display subtle color refraction and reflections consistent with emerald and jade materials, without unnatural glowing patches or excessive chromatic aberration?",
    "explanation": "The crystal surfaces in Image B exhibit vibrant green hues with multiple facets that refract light in a way characteristic of high-quality emerald or jade-like materials. The color variation ranges from deep forest green to lighter, translucent tones, especially along the edges and corners of the facets. These variations create a dynamic interplay of light and shadow, enhancing the illusion of depth and translucency. The reflections are sharp and coherent, with no signs of over-saturation or artificial glow. There are no noticeable glowing patches or areas of excessive chromatic aberration—instead, the colors shift smoothly depending on the angle of light, much like real gemstones. The material behavior aligns well with known optical properties of emeralds and jade, which include moderate dispersion and rich green tones. While some digital enhancement may be present, the overall effect remains naturalistic and consistent with expected gemstone optics. Thus, the refraction and reflection patterns are believable and appropriate for the intended material simulation.",
    "answer": "Yes"
