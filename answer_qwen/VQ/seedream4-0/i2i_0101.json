      "question": "Is the text 'flyaway' added below the painting seamlessly integrated into the image without disrupting its authentic appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'flyaway' appears to be placed directly on the wall beneath the painting. It is written in a cursive font that mimics handwriting, which can give an impression of natural integration. The color of the text blends well with the background, and there are no visible edges or shadows that would suggest it was digitally pasted. This suggests that the text has been added in a way that maintains the authenticity of the scene.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the handwriting of 'flyaway' appear natural and consistent with what one would expect on a postcard-style image?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The handwriting of 'flyaway' is in a flowing cursive style, which is commonly associated with personal touches like those found on postcards. The variation in stroke thickness and the slight tilt of the letters contribute to a natural look. Considering postcards often have handwritten messages, this style aligns well with such expectations.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Has the addition of 'flyaway' caused any visible artifacts or unnatural textures around the painting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Upon examining the area around the painting where 'flyaway' is written, there are no noticeable artifacts or disruptions in texture. The wall's surface looks smooth and uniform, suggesting that the text has been added without causing any visual anomalies that would detract from the image's quality.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the text 'flyaway' maintain proper proportion and not cover any significant part of the painting or adjacent objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'flyaway' is positioned below the painting and does not overlap with it or any other objects in the image. Its size is relatively small compared to the painting and other elements, ensuring it does not dominate the composition. This placement and sizing indicate that the proportion is appropriate and respectful of the surrounding elements.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall composition of the image still visually coherent and balanced after adding the text 'flyaway'?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition remains balanced as the text 'flyaway' is centrally aligned under the painting, maintaining symmetry. The spacing between the text, the painting, and the objects on the cabinet is harmonious. The addition of the text enhances rather than disrupts the visual flow, contributing to a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing arrangement.",
