      "question": "Does the figurine maintain the structural coherence of the apple's original shape without introducing unnatural distortions or breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the figurine features a head that is a halved apple, with the cut surface facing forward. The apple's core and seed are clearly visible, and the shape retains the natural curvature and symmetry typical of a sliced apple. The stem remains intact and positioned naturally at the top. There are no visible cracks, warping, or unnatural breaks in the apple’s structure. The transition from the apple half to the human-like body appears seamless in terms of integration, suggesting that the apple portion has been preserved faithfully in its anatomical form. This suggests that the apple’s original shape has been maintained without distortion, as it still reflects the expected cross-sectional anatomy of an apple. Based on visual cues and common knowledge of apple morphology, this representation aligns with realistic expectations.",

      "question": "Are the materials used for the figurine and accessories visually consistent with the One Piece theme and free from unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine is styled after a character from the 'One Piece' anime series, evident from the box design featuring Luffy and other characters, along with the iconic skull-and-crossbones logo and pirate-themed elements. The materials appear to be plastic or resin, typical for collectible figures, with painted details. The apple head, while unusual, is rendered with a smooth texture and coloration resembling real fruit, which is plausible given the stylized nature of such merchandise. The clothing (red vest, blue shorts with fur trim, sandals) matches the aesthetic of the show, and the sword and accessories inside the box are proportionally appropriate and stylistically consistent with the pirate theme. There are no visible textural anomalies—such as mismatched gloss levels or unnatural sheen—that would suggest poor material quality. Thus, the materials are consistent with standard collectible figure production and thematically appropriate.",

      "question": "Does the placement of the figurine inside the collector's box appear natural and does it avoid any visual inconsistencies or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine inside the box is positioned standing on a detailed diorama base that includes a treasure map, a hat, and scattered coins—elements commonly associated with pirate themes. The figure is placed upright, facing slightly toward the viewer, with one leg forward in a dynamic pose. The scale and positioning match the dimensions of the box, and there is no indication of forced placement or clipping. The lighting and shadows within the box suggest depth and realism. Additionally, the same figurine outside the box mirrors the internal version exactly, confirming that the internal placement is accurate and not digitally altered or distorted. Therefore, the placement appears natural and coherent with both the figure’s design and the box’s interior layout.",

      "question": "Does the figurine display detailed craftsmanship with realistic textures and no loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figurine exhibits high-quality detailing: the apple head shows visible grain patterns and a realistic texture mimicking the flesh and skin of a real apple. The stem is well-defined, and the seed cavity is accurately represented. The clothing has distinct folds and fabric textures, especially noticeable in the red vest and frayed denim shorts. The accessories, such as the sword and sandals, have intricate designs consistent with collectible standards. Even the shadowing and highlights suggest careful rendering of surface detail. There are no signs of pixelation, blurring, or missing elements that would indicate a loss of fine detail. Given the complexity of combining organic (apple) and anthropomorphic forms, the craftsmanship is impressive and maintains consistency across all parts.",

      "question": "Are the miniature accessories proportionally correct and physically plausible relative to the figurine and the collector's box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The accessories inside the box—such as the treasure map, pirate hat, swords, and gold coins—are scaled appropriately to the figurine. The map lies flat beneath the figure’s feet and is large enough to serve as a base but small enough to fit within the box’s footprint. The swords are sized correctly for a figure of this scale, with handles and blades proportionate to the character’s hand and body. The coins are small but discernible, matching the size expected for collectible-scale items. The overall spatial arrangement within the box is balanced, with no objects appearing oversized or undersized. The external figurine matches the internal one perfectly, reinforcing that proportions are consistent. Thus, the accessories are both proportionally correct and physically plausible within the context of a collectible toy set.",
