      "question": "Are the teal and white colors applied smoothly to the van's body without any unnatural edges or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The teal and white colors on the van's body appear to be applied smoothly. There are no visible jagged edges or color bleeding that would suggest a poor edit. The transition between the two colors is clean, which aligns with common practices in vehicle painting where smooth gradients and clear lines are desirable. This analysis is based solely on the visual cues present in Image B.",

      "question": "Do the chrome accents on the grille and wheels appear reflective and smooth, without any visible distortions or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The chrome accents on the grille and wheels exhibit reflective properties typical of polished metal surfaces. They reflect light in a manner consistent with real-world chrome finishes, without any distortions or unnatural textures that would indicate a poorly executed edit. This conclusion is drawn from observing the highlights and reflections on these surfaces in Image B.",

      "question": "Does the roof rack with surfboards look proportionate and securely attached to the van, without any signs of distortion or unrealistic placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The roof rack with surfboards appears proportionate and securely attached to the van. The surfboards are aligned naturally with the rack, and there are no signs of distortion or unrealistic placement that would suggest an improper edit. The size and positioning of the surfboards relative to the van seem appropriate for a beach setting, as inferred from the visual context in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall image does have a slightly desaturated look with a warm tone, reminiscent of vintage postcards. This effect gives the image a nostalgic feel, which is often achieved through specific photo editing techniques to evoke a certain era or mood. There are no obvious artifacts or overly processed effects that detract from this aesthetic, as observed in Image B.",

      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The windows and doors of the van maintain their original shapes and proportions, fitting well within the new vintage surf van design. There are no noticeable deformations or irregularities that would disrupt the seamless integration of these elements into the overall design. This assessment is based on the visual coherence of the van's features in Image B.",
