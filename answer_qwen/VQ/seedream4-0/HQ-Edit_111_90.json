      "question": "Are the metal filigree patterns and gemstone placements on the transformed necklace clearly defined and free from geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is no necklace present to analyze for filigree patterns or gemstone placements. The image depicts a glass dome with a chandelier, snake, pond, and decorative elements. Therefore, it's not possible to assess the clarity or distortion of a necklace in this context.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the snake tail maintain its original scaly texture and smooth curvature as it emerges from the mossy bank without sudden breaks or unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snake tail in Image B appears to have a consistent scaly texture and follows a smooth curve as it extends from the mossy bank. There are no visible abrupt changes or unnatural bends that disrupt its natural appearance. This conclusion is drawn by observing the continuity and flow of the snake's body against the background.",

      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the glass dome visually transparent with consistent reflections and refractions across its surface, showing no jagged edges or digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears transparent, allowing clear visibility of the objects inside. It shows consistent reflections and refractions, such as light bending around the objects within the dome. There are no noticeable jagged edges or digital artifacts that would suggest poor image quality or editing issues.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the emerald pond display natural water surface details such as subtle ripples and reflections, and are the silver leaves evenly shaped with consistent metallic highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The emerald pond in Image B exhibits natural-looking water surface details, including subtle ripples and reflections that mimic real water behavior. The silver leaves surrounding the pond are uniformly shaped with consistent metallic highlights, suggesting careful attention to detail in their design.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the ornate branches supporting the chandelier proportionally sized and shaped to resemble natural plant structures without angular breaks or unnatural joints?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The branches supporting the chandelier in Image B are proportionally sized and shaped in a way that resembles natural plant structures. They do not exhibit any angular breaks or unnatural joints, maintaining a fluid and organic appearance that complements the chandelier.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "Yes",
      "is_correct": true
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q6",
      "question": "Do the new elements (pond, leaves, branches, dome) properly overlap and interact with the original necklace and snake tail without floating disjointedly or violating depth cues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B does not contain a necklace; therefore, there is no interaction between the new elements and a necklace to evaluate. However, the snake tail, pond, leaves, branches, and dome appear to be well-integrated, with proper overlapping and depth cues that create a cohesive scene.",
