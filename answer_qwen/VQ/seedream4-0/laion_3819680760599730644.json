      "question": "Is the lens area transformed into eyes with smooth, symmetrical shapes and natural-looking reflections, without jagged edges or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lens of the camera has been creatively modified to resemble cartoon eyes. The two white circular shapes placed above the lens represent eyes, and they are symmetrically aligned with respect to the center axis of the camera. These 'eyes' have smooth, rounded edges typical of cartoon illustrations, and there is no visible pixelation or jaggedness in their contours. The reflections within the lens itself appear consistent with a glass surface under bright lighting, maintaining a realistic appearance despite the addition of the cartoon elements. However, the 'eyes' are not actual reflections but digitally added graphics; thus, they are stylistically integrated rather than physically accurate. The lighting on the lens remains consistent with the overall illumination of the scene, suggesting careful rendering to avoid harsh shadows or unnatural highlights. Therefore, while the transformation is stylized, it maintains smoothness and symmetry appropriate for a cartoon aesthetic.",

      "question": "Are the buttons on top of the camera reshaped into brows with preserved circular and rectangular outlines, without deformation or unnatural contours?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The top of the camera in Image B shows no visible modification of the original buttons into brows. Instead, the 'brows' are represented by two simple curved black lines drawn directly above the cartoon eyes, which are positioned over the lens. These lines do not correspond to any physical features of the camera’s buttons or controls. They are abstract, cartoon-style additions that do not preserve the original shape or structure of the buttons. In fact, the original buttons (such as the mode dial and shutter release) remain intact and unaltered in form. Since the brows are not derived from reshaping existing components but are entirely new graphical elements, the original outlines of the buttons are not transformed at all. Hence, the question's premise—that the buttons were reshaped—does not hold true.",

      "question": "Is the explorer’s hat positioned correctly on top of the camera, with consistent lighting and no visible gaps or overlaps with the camera body?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The explorer’s hat in Image B is placed atop the camera body, centered over the 'Canon' branding. It appears to be a standard pith helmet rendered in a cartoon style, with a light brown color and a darker band around the base. The hat sits flush against the top of the camera, with no noticeable gaps between its underside and the camera body. The lighting on the hat matches the ambient jungle environment—soft and diffused—consistent with the rest of the image. There are no sharp shadows or highlights that would suggest misalignment or floating. Additionally, the edge where the hat meets the camera is clean, with no overlapping pixels or clipping artifacts. The integration appears seamless, suggesting careful digital placement and shading to maintain visual coherence.",

      "question": "If any part of the backpack is visible, does it show realistic shadows and attachment to the camera body without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The backpack attached to the right side of the camera in Image B is clearly visible and stylized to match the cartoon theme. It is connected via an orange strap that wraps around the camera body, appearing securely fastened. The backpack casts a subtle shadow onto the camera body and the surrounding grass, indicating a light source from the upper left, which aligns with the overall lighting direction in the scene. The shadow is soft and appropriately scaled, contributing to the sense of depth. There are no signs of floating—the backpack is anchored by the strap and visually grounded. The edges of the backpack and strap blend well with the camera, showing no misalignment or pixelation. The design is consistent with the playful tone of the illustration, and the physics of attachment are simplified but plausible within the cartoon context.",

      "question": "Does the jungle background blend smoothly with the camera’s edges, without visible outlines, pixelation, or color bleeding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The jungle background in Image B is richly illustrated with vibrant greens, leaves, and foliage, creating a lively setting. The camera is centrally placed and appears to be composited into this environment. Upon close inspection, the edges of the camera are cleanly defined, with no visible outlines, jagged pixels, or halo effects that would indicate poor masking or blending. The lighting and shading on the camera are consistent with the ambient light of the jungle scene, helping it integrate naturally. There is no evidence of color bleeding—where colors from the background bleed into the camera’s silhouette—nor are there any telltale signs of anti-aliasing issues. The transition between the camera and the background is smooth, suggesting professional compositing techniques were used. The cartoon style allows for slightly softer edges, but these are intentional and not indicative of technical flaws.",

      "question": "Is the tagline “Capture every quest!” clearly visible, stylistically consistent with the cartoon theme, and positioned without obscuring important camera details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tagline 'Capture every quest!' is prominently displayed at the bottom of Image B in bold, stylized orange text with a black outline and slight shadow effect. The font choice is playful and energetic, matching the cartoonish tone of the entire image. It is positioned at the lower third of the frame, resting on the grassy foreground, which ensures it does not cover critical parts of the camera such as the lens or model name. The text is fully legible and stands out against the green background due to high contrast. Its placement respects the composition, allowing viewers to read it easily while still focusing on the central character—the anthropomorphized camera. There is no obstruction of key features like the lens, buttons, or branding, and the styling complements the adventurous theme suggested by the explorer motif.",
