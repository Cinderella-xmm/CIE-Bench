    "Question": "Q1: Does the long flowing robe have natural fabric draping and folds that follow the contours of the body without unnatural stretching or clumping?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the figure is depicted wearing a long, floral-patterned robe. The fabric appears to drape naturally around the seated posture, with soft folds that suggest weight and movement consistent with traditional robes. The folds align with the curvature of the body—especially around the hips, knees, and arms—without any visible signs of unnatural stretching or clumping. The way the fabric gathers at the edges and under the arms follows typical physics of cloth behavior in watercolor illustrations, where artists aim for fluidity and realism within stylized contexts. Given the artistic style (reminiscent of Studio Ghibli or watercolor anime), such draping is intentionally expressive but still adheres to anatomical logic. There are no areas where the fabric seems artificially compressed or stretched beyond plausible limits.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the limbs and joints of the seated figure anatomically correct, with no distorted angles or disproportionate lengths?",
    "explanation": "The seated figure in Image B has proportions and joint placements that align closely with human anatomy. The legs are bent at the knees in a natural sitting position, with feet placed appropriately on the ground or rocks. The arms rest comfortably, holding a book, with elbows positioned at realistic angles relative to the torso. The shoulders are level, and the spine maintains a gentle curve consistent with relaxed seating. While the art style is stylized (common in anime or illustrated books), the limbs are proportionate and do not exhibit exaggerated elongation or angular distortions. For instance, the forearm-to-upper-arm ratio and the placement of the hands appear accurate. This suggests careful attention to anatomical correctness even within a simplified aesthetic framework.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the eyes significantly larger than normal but still proportionally integrated into the face without distorting surrounding facial features?",
    "explanation": "The character's eyes in Image B are indeed significantly larger than those of an average human, which is characteristic of many anime and manga styles. However, despite their size, they are proportionally integrated into the face. The eyebrows, nose, and mouth remain balanced relative to the large eyes, and there is no visual distortion of adjacent features such as cheekbones or jawline. The large eyes serve an expressive purpose while maintaining facial harmony—a common technique used in Japanese animation to convey emotion without compromising overall facial structure. Thus, although exaggerated, the eyes are stylistically appropriate and do not disrupt the facial composition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the mountain and lake reflections exhibit soft, blended watercolor transitions without sharp edges or artificial-looking brush strokes?",
    "explanation": "The reflections in the lake across all four panels of Image B show smooth gradients and soft blending typical of watercolor techniques. The mountains' mirrored images fade gently into the water, with subtle variations in tone and color that mimic real light diffusion on water surfaces. There are no harsh lines or abrupt changes in hue, indicating intentional use of wet-on-wet painting methods to achieve natural-looking transitions. Additionally, the texture of the paper and the slight bleeding of pigments enhance the authenticity of the medium. The reflection of clouds and sky also shows diffused shapes rather than sharp outlines, reinforcing the impression of a calm, reflective surface. These qualities align with traditional watercolor aesthetics and avoid digital artifacts or overly defined edges.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Is the lilac-edged border uniformly applied around the image without overlapping or obscuring any part of the scene?",
    "explanation": "Each of the four panels in Image B is framed by a thin, lilac-colored border. Upon close inspection, this border is consistently applied along all four sides of each panel, maintaining uniform width and alignment. It does not intrude into the painted scenes nor cover any essential elements such as the figure, flowers, or landscape details. The border acts as a clean separation between the artwork and the surrounding page, enhancing readability and visual organization. There is no evidence of misalignment, overlap, or clipping of content, suggesting careful design and execution. This consistency supports the idea that the borders were intentionally drawn to frame the images neatly without interference.",
    "answer": "Yes"
