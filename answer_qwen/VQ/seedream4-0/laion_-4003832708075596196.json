      "question": "Do the transformed trunk sections into arms and legs follow natural joint-like curves and avoid sharp, unnatural bends?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the tree trunks have been anthropomorphized into characters with limbs. The arms and legs are drawn as simple, curved lines extending from the main trunk body. These limbs exhibit smooth, rounded bends that resemble natural joint articulations—such as elbows and knees—without any abrupt or angular turns. The curves are consistent with cartoon-style representations of limbs, where fluidity is prioritized over anatomical precision. Given that this is a stylized illustration, the limbs are not meant to be realistic but rather expressive and playful. However, they still maintain a sense of proportion and flow that avoids sharp, jarring angles. This aligns with common design principles in cartoon character creation, where smooth curves enhance readability and appeal.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the leaf-shaped heads composed of intact maple leaves with visible veins and gradient coloring, and do the facial features (eyes, mouth) sit naturally on the surface without distorting the leaf shape?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The heads of the two characters in Image B are clearly shaped like maple leaves, consistent with the autumn theme. Each head displays a gradient coloration transitioning from yellow to orange, mimicking natural fall foliage. Veins are visibly present within the leaf structure, enhancing the botanical authenticity. Facial features—large round eyes and smiling mouths—are placed centrally on the leaf surfaces. While these features are stylized, they do not distort the overall outline of the leaves; instead, they are layered on top in a way that preserves the integrity of the leaf form. This approach is typical in cartoon illustrations where character elements are superimposed onto symbolic shapes without altering their fundamental structure. Thus, the leaf shapes remain recognizable despite the addition of faces.",

      "question": "Are the hats and scarves rendered with the same flat, vector-style design as the rest of the image, and do they have consistent edge lines and no visible texture artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hats and scarves in Image B are designed using solid colors and clean outlines, matching the flat, vector-based aesthetic of the entire illustration. The hats are brown with a gold buckle and black band, and the scarf is striped in orange and red. All edges are crisp and uniform, with no pixelation, shading, or texture effects that would suggest rasterization or low-resolution rendering. The style is consistent with the rest of the image, which uses simple shapes and bold lines typical of digital vector art. There are no visible artifacts such as jagged edges or noise, indicating high-quality vector execution. This consistency supports the idea that the artwork was created digitally using vector graphics software.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all added elements (limbs, faces, accessories) colored exclusively within the original orange, yellow, red, and brown spectrum, with no unexpected or contrasting hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette of Image B is dominated by warm autumn tones: orange, yellow, red, and various shades of brown. The limbs (arms and legs), facial features, hats, and scarves all adhere strictly to this color scheme. For example, the skin tone of the characters is a warm brown, the hats are dark brown with gold buckles, and the scarves use orange and red stripes. Even the speech bubbles and text are in a complementary brown hue. There are no sudden shifts to cool colors like blue or green, nor are there metallic or neon accents that would contrast with the seasonal theme. This cohesive color strategy reinforces the Thanksgiving motif and maintains visual harmony throughout the composition.",

      "question": "Do all anthropomorphized tree characters and their accessories lie completely within the brown rectangular border without extending outside its edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The brown rectangular border frames the central illustration in Image B. Both anthropomorphized tree characters—the one on the left with a wooden trunk and the one on the right wearing a scarf—are positioned entirely inside this border. Their limbs, heads, and accessories (hats, scarves) do not extend beyond the frame. The speech bubbles also remain within the border, though some appear close to the edges. However, none of the characters or elements cross the boundary line. This adherence to the frame ensures visual balance and follows standard design practices for greeting cards, where content is contained within a defined area to preserve layout integrity.",

      "question": "Are the text bubbles placed near the characters without overlapping leaves or limbs, and do they have consistent line thickness and transparent fill matching the illustration’s style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubbles in Image B are positioned around the characters, pointing toward their mouths, which is a conventional placement in cartoon dialogue. They do not overlap with any part of the characters’ bodies, including leaves or limbs, ensuring clarity and readability. The bubbles are outlined with thin, consistent brown lines, matching the border and other graphic elements in the image. The fill appears transparent or white, allowing the background to show through, which is typical in vector illustrations to maintain simplicity and focus on the text. The style is uniform across all bubbles, with no variation in stroke width or fill opacity. This consistency supports a clean, professional look aligned with the overall design language.",
