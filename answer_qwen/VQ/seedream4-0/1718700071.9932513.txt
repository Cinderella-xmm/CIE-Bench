    "Question": "Q1: Are the curls in the hair rendered with consistent marble texture, showing natural variations in depth and surface detail without visible artifacts such as blurring, flattening, or inconsistent shading?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the hair is sculpted in a highly detailed, curly style that mimics the appearance of carved marble. The curls exhibit fine textural details consistent with stone carving, including subtle variations in depth and surface relief. Each curl appears to have its own volume and shadowing, suggesting careful rendering of three-dimensional form. There are no signs of blurring or flattening—each strand maintains definition and separation from adjacent ones. The shading transitions smoothly across the curls, indicating attention to light direction and material properties typical of polished marble. Given the context of a marble sculpture, such consistency in texture and depth is expected and observed here. No visual artifacts like jagged edges or inconsistent lighting disrupt the illusion of carved stone.",

    "Question": "Q2: Do the ornamental carvings on the neck and shoulders maintain anatomical alignment with the musculature and have continuous, coherent shapes without gaps, misaligned edges, or geometric distortions?",
    "explanation": "The ornamental carvings around the neck and shoulders in Image B are intricately designed and appear to be seamlessly integrated into the figure’s anatomy. The necklace-like structure follows the contours of the clavicles and pectoral muscles, maintaining a natural alignment with the underlying musculature. The carvings feature symmetrical, flowing patterns that do not intersect awkwardly with muscle definition. There are no visible gaps or breaks in the design; all edges appear smooth and continuous, suggesting high-quality sculptural craftsmanship. The geometry of the ornamentation remains coherent throughout, with no evidence of distortion or misalignment. This level of integration is consistent with classical marble sculptures where decorative elements are carefully planned to complement the human form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the angelic figures in the background depicted with clear outlines, proper proportions, and consistent depth relative to the central figure, without appearing flat, distorted, or fragmented?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background features two angelic figures carved into the surrounding architectural elements. These figures possess clear, well-defined outlines and are proportionally accurate when compared to standard depictions of angels in classical sculpture. Their wings, limbs, and facial features are distinct and exhibit appropriate depth through the use of shadows and relief carving. They are positioned behind the central figure at a greater distance, which is visually reinforced by reduced detail and softer contrast—consistent with perspective in sculptural reliefs. There is no indication of fragmentation or distortion; the forms are cohesive and stylistically unified with the rest of the composition. The depth relationship between the angels and the main subject is maintained effectively, contributing to a sense of layered space within the marble environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the entire image uniformly rendered in a monochrome palette with smooth gradients and no abrupt transitions between light and dark areas that suggest incomplete color conversion or artifacting?",
    "explanation": "Image B is presented entirely in grayscale, simulating the appearance of white marble. The tonal range spans from bright highlights to deep shadows, creating a realistic representation of light interacting with stone. The gradients across surfaces—such as the chest, arms, and facial features—are smooth and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or banding effects that would indicate poor rendering or incomplete desaturation. The transition from light to dark areas follows natural lighting principles, with soft falloffs and subtle gradations that enhance the three-dimensionality of the figure. There are no visible artifacts such as color fringing, pixelation, or unnatural halos around edges, which confirms that the monochrome treatment was applied uniformly and professionally. This suggests a deliberate artistic choice rather than an error in processing.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Do both hands display exactly five fingers each with natural joint articulation and realistic proportions, without fused digits, elongated limbs, or unnatural bending?",
    "explanation": "Upon close inspection of both hands in Image B, each hand clearly shows five individual fingers. The fingers are proportionally accurate, with natural articulation at the knuckles and joints. There is no fusion of digits, nor any elongation or disproportionate scaling. The positioning of the hands is relaxed and anatomically plausible, with slight curvature in the fingers that reflects natural resting posture. The fingernails are subtly defined, and the overall shape of the hands aligns with human anatomy. The wrist and forearm connections are smooth and correctly modeled, without distortion. All these factors confirm that the hands are realistically rendered within the context of a marble sculpture, adhering to anatomical accuracy while preserving the stylized yet lifelike quality typical of classical statuary.",
    "answer": "Yes"
