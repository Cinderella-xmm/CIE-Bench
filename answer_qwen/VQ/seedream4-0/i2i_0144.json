      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small flag reading 'Fresh' is placed on top of the sandwich in a manner that appears natural.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The layers of the sandwich appear consistent after replacing the tomato slices with grilled pineapple.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The small flag maintains its texture and detail without any noticeable unnatural appearances or artifacts.

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandwich retains its structural coherence and visual plausibility after the edits.
