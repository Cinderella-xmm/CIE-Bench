    "Question": "Q1: Does the heart balloon retain its geometric shape without any broken lines or unnatural textures in the mosaic style?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the heart-shaped balloon is rendered in a mosaic style, composed of individual tiles that form the overall shape. Despite the mosaic technique, the heart maintains its recognizable geometric outline with smooth curves and consistent proportions. The edges of the heart are defined by dark grout lines between tiles, which follow the intended contour without breaking or jaggedness. There are no visible cracks, gaps, or irregularities in the tile arrangement that would distort the shape. The red color remains uniform across the tiles, suggesting a cohesive design. This indicates that the transformation into mosaic form preserves the integrity of the heart's shape without introducing unnatural textures or broken lines.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the child's facial features and hair preserved with clear outlines and no distortion in the mosaic transformation?",
    "explanation": "The child’s face in Image B is constructed using mosaic tiles, where each feature—such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and hair—is segmented into individual colored tiles. While the mosaic style inherently introduces some level of abstraction, the facial features remain clearly distinguishable. The outline of the face, including the jawline and forehead, is well-defined, and the hair retains its spiky, stylized shape typical of the original artwork. However, due to the tiling, fine details like the subtle shading on the cheek or the exact curvature of the eyelid may be slightly softened. Nevertheless, there is no significant distortion; the overall expression and structure of the face are preserved with clear, intentional contours. The mosaic adaptation respects the original silhouette and key features without compromising clarity.",
    "answer": "yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the background transformed into a mosaic style without introducing any obvious artifacts or disrupting the blue and yellow color harmony?",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B consists of rectangular tiles arranged in a brick-like pattern, alternating between shades of blue and yellow. These colors match the original palette seen in Image A, maintaining the visual harmony between warm (yellow) and cool (blue) tones. The transition between colors appears smooth and intentional, with no abrupt shifts or misaligned tiles that would suggest artifacts. Each tile is uniformly sized and spaced, contributing to a consistent texture that mimics a painted brick wall but in a tiled format. The mosaic effect enhances the artistic style without distorting the color balance or introducing visual noise. Therefore, the transformation successfully adapts the background into a mosaic while preserving both aesthetic continuity and color coherence.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Does the red balloon maintain its vibrant color and round shape without any loss of detail or introduction of unnatural textures?",
    "explanation": "The red balloon in Image B is depicted as a single, glossy, circular object made from a continuous surface of red tiles. Despite being part of the mosaic, the balloon retains its vibrant red hue, with a slight highlight indicating a light source, which adds realism. The round shape is preserved, with no angular distortions or flattening due to tiling. The edges of the balloon are cleanly defined, and the surface texture appears smooth and consistent, lacking any pixelation or jaggedness. The string connecting the balloon to the child is also intact and properly aligned. Overall, the mosaic technique does not compromise the balloon’s visual fidelity; it remains visually striking and true to the original depiction.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the child's hand retain a natural appearance with no more than five fingers and no distortion in the mosaic style?",
    "explanation": "The child’s hand in Image B is rendered using mosaic tiles, but the number of fingers is clearly identifiable as five, consistent with human anatomy. The fingers are proportionally spaced and extend naturally from the palm, with distinct separation between them. Although the mosaic style simplifies the contours, the overall shape of the hand remains anatomically plausible. There are no extra digits or fused fingers, and the gesture—reaching out toward the heart balloon—is preserved. The tiles used for the hand do not introduce unnatural bulges or elongations. Thus, despite the stylization, the hand maintains a natural appearance within the constraints of the mosaic medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"
