      "question": "Does the character’s head appear significantly larger than the body while maintaining smooth contours and proper alignment of limbs and torso without visible stretching or tearing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is stylized in a cartoonish, exaggerated manner typical of animated characters. The head is notably large relative to the body, which is a common design choice in animation to emphasize facial expressions and convey personality. However, despite this exaggeration, the contours of the head and body are smooth, with no visible stretching, tearing, or distortion. The limbs and torso are proportionally aligned with the head, maintaining a coherent and balanced structure. This style is consistent with many modern animated characters (e.g., Pixar or Disney animations), where proportions are intentionally distorted for artistic effect but still maintain visual harmony. Therefore, although the head is larger than anatomically accurate, it does not violate the criteria of smoothness or structural integrity.",

      "question": "Are the patterns on the character’s suit evenly distributed, free from repeating tiles or jagged edges, and do they follow a logical direction consistent with fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character's suit in Image B features a vibrant, multicolored pattern with swirling designs and geometric shapes. Upon close inspection, the pattern appears consistent across the jacket and pants, with no obvious repeating tiles or sharp, jagged edges that would suggest poor rendering. The pattern flows in a way that respects the curvature of the body, such as around the shoulders and elbows, suggesting an attempt to simulate fabric drape. While the style is highly stylized and abstract, the pattern distribution remains even and visually cohesive. There is no evidence of unnatural tiling or misalignment that would break immersion. Given the artistic nature of the image, the patterns are rendered with care to maintain continuity and aesthetic appeal, aligning with high-quality digital animation standards.",

      "question": "Are the oversized glasses fully rendered with clear lenses and frames, aligned with the eye region, and without partial transparency or clipping against facial features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character in Image B wears large, black-framed glasses that cover most of the eye area. The frames are solid and well-defined, with no signs of clipping or partial transparency. The lenses are opaque and clearly rendered, showing no distortions or artifacts. The glasses are positioned symmetrically over the eyes, following the natural alignment of the facial features. Although the glasses are oversized—again, a stylistic choice—they do not intersect improperly with the nose or cheeks. In fact, they are integrated seamlessly into the character’s face, with appropriate shading and depth cues that suggest three-dimensionality. This level of detail indicates careful rendering, consistent with professional animation practices.",

      "question": "Does the hand have exactly five fingers, with natural curvature and spacing, and are there no distorted knuckles, extra digits, or unnatural shadowing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character’s raised hand in Image B displays five distinct fingers, each with a rounded tip and natural curvature. The spacing between the fingers is consistent with human anatomy, though slightly exaggerated for cartoon effect. The knuckles are simplified but present, and there are no extra digits or anomalies such as fused fingers. Shadowing is minimal but follows the light source logically, contributing to the perception of volume without appearing unnatural. While the hand is stylized, it adheres to basic anatomical principles and avoids common AI-generated distortions like extra fingers or warped joints. This suggests a deliberate and skilled design process rather than an error-prone generation.",

      "question": "Are the abstract skyscrapers and balloons positioned at plausible distances, casting soft shadows, and aligned with the character’s perspective without floating above ground or appearing detached?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B features a stylized cityscape with colorful, geometric skyscrapers and floating balloons. The buildings are arranged in layers that suggest depth, with some appearing closer and others further away, creating a sense of perspective. The balloons are positioned at various heights, some near the top of the frame, others mid-air, and all appear to be tethered or floating naturally within the scene. Soft shadows are visible beneath the balloons and along the base of the buildings, indicating a consistent light source from above. The entire scene maintains spatial coherence, with no elements floating unnaturally or disconnected from the ground. The overall composition is harmonious and visually plausible within the context of a whimsical, animated world. Thus, despite the abstraction, the placement and lighting are carefully designed to support a believable environment.",
