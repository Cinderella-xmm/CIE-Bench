    "Question": "Q1: Does the handwritten word 'Draft' on the yellow paper appear seamlessly integrated without unnatural textures or color discrepancies?",
    "explanation": "The handwritten word 'Draft' on the yellow paper appears to be rendered with a consistent texture and shading that matches typical pencil writing. The strokes exhibit natural variations in thickness, which is characteristic of handwriting with a graphite pencil. The color of the text is dark gray/black, consistent with graphite marks on paper. There are no visible signs of pixelation, artificial edges, or color bleeding that would suggest digital manipulation or poor integration. The shadowing beneath the letters is subtle and plausible, suggesting a light source from above, which aligns with the lighting in the rest of the image. Based on these visual cues and common knowledge about how pencil writing appears on paper, the text seems naturally integrated.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the style and material of the handwritten word 'Draft' visually consistent with the pencil used in the image and typical design sketches?",
    "explanation": "The blue pencil shown in the image is a standard hexagonal wooden pencil with a sharpened graphite tip, commonly used for sketching or note-taking. The handwritten word 'Draft' exhibits cursive-like, fluid strokes with slight pressure variation, which is typical of handwriting done with a pencil. The darkness and texture of the lines match what one would expect from graphite on paper—no ink-like smoothness or sharpness that would suggest a pen. Furthermore, the word 'Draft' is often associated with preliminary work, making it contextually appropriate for a sketch or draft scenario. The overall style is consistent with informal, hand-written notes rather than typed or digitally generated text, reinforcing its plausibility as a pencil-drawn addition.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Has the addition of the handwritten word 'Draft' preserved the structural integrity of the yellow paper, avoiding any distortion or misalignment?",
    "explanation": "The yellow sticky note remains flat and undistorted in Image B. The edges of the paper are clean and maintain their original shape, with no visible warping, creasing, or bending introduced by the addition of the text. The placement of the word 'Draft' is centered and proportionate to the size of the note, fitting naturally within the available space. There is no evidence of layering artifacts, such as overlapping shadows or inconsistent depth cues, that might suggest the text was superimposed improperly. The alignment of the text relative to the paper’s edges is consistent with natural handwriting, and there are no visual distortions that would compromise the perceived physical integrity of the paper.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the edges of the handwritten word 'Draft' sharp and clear, without introducing any unnatural blurring or pixelation?",
    "explanation": "The edges of the handwritten word 'Draft' are well-defined and show no signs of digital blurring or pixelation. The stroke outlines are smooth, with minor natural irregularities that mimic real pencil writing, such as slight wobbling or tapering at the ends of strokes. These imperfections are consistent with human handwriting and do not appear artificially smoothed or overly crisp, which could indicate digital rendering. Additionally, the contrast between the dark graphite and the bright yellow background is strong but not harsh, indicating proper blending without aliasing. The resolution of the image supports clear visibility of fine details, confirming that the text has been added with high fidelity.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Does the positioning of the pencil on the yellow paper remain physically logical and visually credible after adding the handwritten word 'Draft'?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the pencil is positioned diagonally across the top-right portion of the yellow sticky note, with its tip resting just above the beginning of the word 'Draft'. This placement is physically plausible because the tip is aligned with where a person would naturally begin writing the word. The angle of the pencil suggests it was held in a typical writing posture, and the shadow cast by the pencil is consistent with the direction of light seen in the scene (likely from the upper left). There is no indication that the pencil has been moved or rotated unnaturally to accommodate the text. Moreover, the presence of the word 'Draft' does not interfere with the spatial logic of the pencil's position; instead, it enhances the narrative of someone actively writing. Thus, the composition maintains visual credibility.",
    "answer": "Yes"
