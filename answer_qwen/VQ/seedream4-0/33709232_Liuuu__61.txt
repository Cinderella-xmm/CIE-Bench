    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the transformed building appears to have a robotic design with an armored body. The visual cues suggest that the structure maintains consistent geometric proportions and smooth surface transitions. There are no visible signs of warping or broken edges in the armored body, as the lines and shapes appear clean and well-defined. This conclusion is drawn from observing the uniformity and coherence of the mechanical elements combined with common knowledge about how such designs are typically rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The shoulder pads on the transformed building in Image B seem to be seamlessly integrated into the roofline. They exhibit clean, sharp edges and coherent patterns that do not appear stretched or fragmented. The integration looks intentional and well-executed, suggesting a high level of detail in the design process. Comparing this with typical architectural features in Image A, where there are no such elements, reinforces the idea that these additions are carefully designed to fit the new aesthetic without disrupting the overall look.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The traffic signs in Image B display clear holographic effects, such as soft glow and transparency, which are evident through their distinct appearance compared to standard signs. These effects do not cause light leaks or unnatural color shifts in adjacent areas, maintaining visual consistency. In contrast, the traffic signs in Image A are standard and lack any holographic qualities, making the comparison straightforward based on the presence or absence of these effects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The robotic pedestrians in Image B have correctly proportioned limbs with five fingers per hand, as observed from their detailed design. Their joints and body shapes follow geometric logic without unnatural bending or missing segments, indicating a well-thought-out design. This analysis is based on the visual coherence of the robots' forms and the application of common principles of robotics and human anatomy for reference.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The shadows cast by the robotic pedestrians and the transformed building in Image B are consistent with the direction of sunlight coming from the top-left. These shadows align naturally with surrounding objects, contributing to a realistic scene. Comparing this with Image A, where natural lighting and shadows are present but without robotic elements, the consistency in shadow direction supports the realism of the edited image.",
    "answer": "Yes"
