      "question": "Does the isometric packaging box have consistent edges, proper depth cues, and accurate alignment with the toy figures without visible warping or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The packaging box in Image B is presented in an isometric view, which allows for a clear visualization of its three-dimensional structure. The edges of the box appear sharp, straight, and uniformly aligned, indicating consistent construction. Depth cues are effectively conveyed through perspective and shading, especially noticeable on the transparent front panel and the angled sides. The box’s placement relative to the toy figures outside it—both the car and the robot—shows no signs of warping or misalignment; the figures are positioned naturally as if they were removed from the box. The internal display tray inside the box also appears flush and properly fitted, maintaining spatial coherence. Given these visual cues and common design standards for product packaging, the box demonstrates accurate geometric representation and alignment.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the chibi-style figures inside the box proportionally consistent with typical chibi design rules (e.g., large heads, short limbs) and do they retain identifiable features of the original car and robot?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The figures inside the box are not chibi-style. Chibi characters are typically characterized by exaggerated proportions such as oversized heads, small bodies, and stubby limbs, often used in anime and cartoon art styles. However, the figures in the box are scaled-down versions of the transforming robot and car, maintaining realistic proportions similar to the external toy models. They preserve key design elements like the red and black color scheme, wheel placement, and mechanical details that reflect both the car and robot forms. While stylized, they do not adhere to chibi conventions. Instead, they follow a more detailed, toy-accurate design. Therefore, the figures are not chibi but rather miniature representations of the main toy.",

      "question": "Are the mini tool set, interchangeable helmets, and gear base clearly defined, properly scaled, and positioned without floating or clipping through other elements inside the box?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the box, several accessories are visible: a set of mini tools (resembling wrenches), two interchangeable helmets (one red, one black), and a circular gear-shaped base. These items are clearly defined with distinct shapes and colors. Their scale appears appropriate relative to the figures—small enough to be accessories but large enough to be recognizable. The tools are placed neatly in rows, the helmets rest beside them, and the gear base supports one of the robot figures. There is no visual evidence of clipping or floating; all objects sit firmly on the display tray, with shadows and positioning suggesting physical contact and proper layering. This arrangement aligns with standard packaging design practices where accessories are displayed securely and logically.",
