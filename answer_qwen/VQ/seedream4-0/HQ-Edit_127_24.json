      "question": "Do the transformed chalets maintain consistent roof slopes and chimney placements without geometric distortion or floating components?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the chalets appear to be constructed from ice and are integrated into a fantastical, icy environment. The roof slopes of the chalets are visually consistent with traditional alpine architecture, maintaining symmetrical angles that align with the structure of the buildings. The chimneys are positioned centrally on the roofs, as is typical in such designs, and there is no visible floating or misaligned component. However, the transformation into ice introduces subtle distortions due to the crystalline nature of the material—edges may appear slightly softened or refracted by the ice’s transparency. Despite this, the overall geometry remains coherent and plausible within the context of an ice sculpture interpretation. There is no evidence of floating elements or significant geometric anomalies that would suggest structural inconsistency. Thus, based on visual analysis and architectural common sense, the chalets retain their intended form with minor artistic liberties.",

      "question": "Is the glowing ice surface continuous across the slope and around the chalets without jagged edges, unnatural reflections, or inconsistent brightness patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing ice surface in Image B exhibits a luminous blue hue that appears to emanate from beneath the ice layer, creating a magical ambiance. The surface surrounding the chalets is smooth and reflective, with gentle gradients in brightness suggesting depth and continuity. There are no visible jagged edges or sharp breaks in the surface; instead, the transitions between areas are fluid, consistent with how light interacts with translucent ice. Reflections on the water-like surface below the chalets are soft and mirror the glow of the structures, enhancing realism. While some slight variations in brightness occur due to lighting effects (e.g., near the base of the chalets), these are natural and expected in a scene involving light refraction through ice. No abrupt patches or artificial-looking highlights are present. Therefore, the ice surface maintains visual continuity and plausibility.",

      "question": "Do the ice-enhanced pine trees retain recognizable tree silhouettes with evenly distributed icicles and no fused or missing branches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pine trees in Image B are heavily encased in ice, with intricate icicle formations hanging from their branches. Despite the heavy frosting, the basic silhouette of each tree remains identifiable as coniferous, with a triangular shape and layered branching pattern typical of pine trees. Icicles are distributed along the branches in a way that follows gravity and natural accumulation patterns, appearing dense but not uniformly packed. Some branches appear partially fused due to thick ice buildup, which is realistic under extreme freezing conditions. However, no major branches are missing or entirely obscured, and the overall structure of the trees is preserved. This level of detail suggests careful design to balance fantasy with natural plausibility. Thus, while there is some fusion due to ice weight, the trees still retain their recognizable forms.",

      "question": "Are the auroras positioned above the mountain range without overlapping the sun or creating unnatural light halos or disconnected streaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the aurora borealis is depicted as a vibrant green ribbon arching across the night sky above the mountain range. It does not overlap with any visible sun, as there is no sun present in this scene—the sky is dark, indicating nighttime. The aurora's placement is consistent with real-world observations, where auroras typically appear in polar regions and extend vertically from the horizon upward. The light emissions are smooth and flowing, with no sharp discontinuities or isolated streaks. There are no unnatural halos or lens flare artifacts that would suggest digital overprocessing. Instead, the aurora blends seamlessly with the starry sky and casts a soft glow on the landscape below, enhancing the atmosphere without violating physical laws of light propagation. Therefore, the aurora is correctly positioned and rendered.",

      "question": "Are the snowflake patterns on the chalet walls uniform in scale and orientation, and do they align naturally with the building's architecture without repeating or distorting at edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The snowflake patterns on the chalet walls in Image B are clearly decorative elements added to enhance the wintry theme. These snowflakes vary in size and orientation, with larger ones near the center and smaller ones toward the edges, which creates a sense of depth and perspective. They are aligned with the vertical lines of the windows and walls, following the architectural grid, which adds to their visual coherence. While some repetition is noticeable—particularly in the lower sections of the wall—this is likely intentional for aesthetic symmetry rather than a flaw. At the edges of the chalets, the snowflakes do not distort or stretch unnaturally; instead, they fade or blend into the ice texture. Given that this is a stylized, fantasy-inspired image, perfect non-repetition is not required. Overall, the patterns are well-integrated and maintain a natural appearance relative to the context.",
