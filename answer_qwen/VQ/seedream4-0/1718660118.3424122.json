      "question": "Do the brass and copper elements on the uniform show natural surface variations, such as subtle scratches, patina, and reflective highlights, without appearing uniformly smooth or unnaturally glossy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the brass and copper components of the uniform—such as the gear-like embellishments, buttons, and arm bracers—are rendered with a high degree of detail. Visual inspection reveals variations in reflectivity, with some areas showing brighter highlights while others appear slightly dulled, suggesting wear or oxidation. The surfaces exhibit a textured appearance consistent with aged metal, including minor scratches and uneven tonal shifts that mimic patina formation over time. These features are indicative of realistic material rendering rather than a uniformly polished or artificial gloss. This aligns with real-world knowledge that metals like brass and copper develop surface imperfections due to exposure and use, especially in mechanical or industrial contexts. Therefore, the depiction reflects natural surface variation.",

      "question": "Are the gear components on the uniform properly embedded within the fabric structure, maintaining consistent depth and avoiding overlapping or misaligned teeth that break geometric continuity?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gear components integrated into the uniform in Image B are carefully designed to appear as if they are part of the clothing’s structure. Each gear is positioned with attention to spatial consistency—teeth interlock correctly, and there is no visible misalignment or floating edges. The gears are layered in a way that respects their physical dimensions, with shadows and highlights indicating proper depth relative to the surrounding fabric. Furthermore, the integration of gears into the lapels, chest, and sleeves maintains geometric continuity; for example, the smaller gears near the collar appear to be affixed flush with the material, not protruding awkwardly. This suggests a deliberate design choice that adheres to principles of mechanical realism and 3D modeling accuracy. There are no apparent instances of overlapping teeth or broken continuity, which would otherwise disrupt the illusion of functional machinery.",

      "question": "Does the mechanical throne have visible support structures and grounding that prevent it from appearing suspended or unstable, with all cogwheels and braces attached logically to the frame?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The mechanical throne in Image B is constructed with a complex network of pipes, gears, and metallic supports that extend downward and outward, providing a clear sense of structural grounding. Visible legs and base plates anchor the throne to an implied floor surface, and internal braces connect various parts of the frame, ensuring visual stability. Cogwheels are mounted on axles and connected via shafts and linkages, demonstrating logical mechanical attachment. Additionally, the placement of gears at different heights and angles suggests functional integration rather than decorative overlay. The absence of floating components or unattached parts reinforces the impression of a solid, engineered object. Based on engineering principles and visual cues such as shadowing and perspective, the throne appears securely supported and physically plausible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the copper, brown, and dark green hues distributed evenly across the uniform, throne, and background, with transitions between colors following natural lighting gradients and avoiding abrupt or patchy changes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color palette in Image B consists primarily of copper, brown, and dark green tones, applied consistently across the uniform, throne, and surrounding environment. Lighting appears to originate from the front-left, casting soft shadows and creating gradual shifts in hue intensity. For instance, the copper elements reflect light more brightly on their upper surfaces, transitioning smoothly into darker, shadowed areas. The dark green fabric of the coat shows subtle gradations, particularly along folds and seams, indicating responsive shading to light direction. The background also follows this lighting logic, with muted tones blending seamlessly into the foreground. There are no sharp boundaries or unnatural patches between colors, suggesting careful attention to color grading and ambient occlusion. This adherence to natural lighting gradients enhances the overall realism and cohesion of the scene.",

      "question": "Do the steam trails in the background have gradual opacity and wispy edges, flowing naturally from potential sources like vents or machinery, without sharp outlines or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The steam trails visible in the background of Image B emerge from what appear to be mechanical joints or pipes near the throne's base and left side. These plumes exhibit soft, diffused edges and varying degrees of transparency, fading gradually into the air. Their form mimics natural vapor dispersion, with thin tendrils curling upward and dispersing into the atmosphere. There are no jagged lines or blocky artifacts that would suggest pixelation or digital noise. Instead, the steam blends smoothly with the surrounding environment, consistent with how heat-induced vapor behaves in real-world conditions. The source points are plausible—near hot machinery—and the flow direction aligns with expected thermodynamic behavior. Thus, the steam is rendered with appropriate realism and fluid dynamics.",

      "question": "Do both hands display five fingers with proper spacing and curvature, and are the knuckles and fingernails rendered with natural detail, without any fused, missing, or duplicated digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close examination of both hands in Image B, each hand clearly displays five distinct fingers with anatomically correct proportions. The spacing between fingers is natural, and the curvature of each digit follows typical human hand morphology. Knuckles are well-defined, with subtle shading indicating joint structure, and fingernails are present and shaped realistically. There is no evidence of fused, missing, or duplicated fingers. Both hands rest on the arms of the throne in a symmetrical, relaxed pose, further reinforcing their anatomical accuracy. The rendering captures fine details such as skin texture and nail beds, contributing to a lifelike appearance. No anomalies in digit count or form are observed, which supports the conclusion that the hands are accurately represented.",
