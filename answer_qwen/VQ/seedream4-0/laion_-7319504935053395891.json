      "question": "Are the cutout windows on each tier aligned with the chocolate drops and have smooth, uninterrupted edges without jagged or fragmented borders?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cutout windows on each tier are clearly visible and appear to be precisely aligned with the chocolate drops (teardrop-shaped chocolate pieces) that hang from them. The edges of these cutouts are clean, smooth, and lack any jagged or fragmented appearance, suggesting high-quality rendering or physical craftsmanship. The alignment between the cutouts and the chocolate drops is consistent across multiple tiers, indicating intentional design. From a visual perspective, there is no evidence of pixelation or distortion, which supports the conclusion that the edges are well-defined and continuous. This level of precision is typical in professional product photography or high-end confectionery design, where symmetry and aesthetic continuity are paramount.",

      "question": "Does the gold foiling applied across the surface show uniform reflectivity and smooth transitions without visible seams, pixelation, or overly bright spots?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The gold foiling on the chocolate elements, particularly on the nuts and decorative cones, appears to have a consistent metallic sheen. Upon close inspection, the reflectivity is even, with no abrupt changes in brightness or visible seams that would suggest poor application or digital artifacts. There are subtle variations in light reflection due to the curved surfaces of the chocolate, but these are natural and expected given the three-dimensional form. No pixelation or unnatural sharp highlights are present, indicating either high-resolution imaging or meticulous physical crafting. The foil's integration into the overall texture suggests careful application, avoiding over-saturation or clumping. Therefore, the gold foiling demonstrates uniformity and smoothness appropriate for premium chocolate artistry.",

      "question": "Are the nut embellishments attached to the chocolate surface with natural positioning, showing correct shadows and depth, and no floating or misplaced instances?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nut embellishments, including almonds, pecans, and other nuts embedded within the chocolate drops and scattered around the structure, are positioned in a way that mimics natural attachment. Each nut casts soft, realistic shadows consistent with the lighting direction, which appears to come from above and slightly to the front. These shadows contribute to a sense of depth and grounding, preventing the nuts from appearing 'floating.' Furthermore, the placement follows anatomical logic—nuts are nestled within the chocolate rather than awkwardly perched on top. There are no instances where nuts seem detached or improperly scaled relative to the surrounding chocolate. This attention to detail aligns with professional confectionery standards, where realism and tactile appeal are crucial.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the sparkle effects evenly distributed and faint enough to resemble light reflections on chocolate, without forming clusters or sharp, unnatural highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sparkle effects visible on the chocolate surface, especially near the base and along the edges of some tiers, are subtle and sparse. They resemble fine dusting or micro-reflections commonly seen when light hits glossy chocolate surfaces. These sparkles are not clustered in one area but are dispersed gently across the surface, maintaining a natural appearance. Their intensity is low, avoiding overly bright spots that could indicate digital over-processing. The effect enhances the luxurious feel of the product without drawing undue attention away from the main design. Given the context of high-end chocolate presentation, such delicate sparkle effects are typical and appropriately executed here.",

      "question": "Is the new text “ChocoConifer Delights” clearly readable, properly spaced, and integrated into the base without overlapping or distorting the surrounding chocolate ring or motifs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text 'ChocoConifer Delights' is prominently displayed on the lower band of the base in an elegant script font. It is clearly legible, with proper spacing between letters and words. The font style complements the luxurious theme of the chocolate tower. The text does not overlap with any decorative elements such as the leaf motifs or the structural rings of the base; instead, it sits cleanly within its designated space. There is no visible distortion, warping, or clipping of the text, indicating careful design integration. The golden color of the text harmonizes with the rest of the gold accents, reinforcing brand consistency. Overall, the typography is professionally rendered and seamlessly incorporated into the product’s branding.",

      "question": "Are the tiers of the tower evenly spaced and aligned vertically, preserving the original conical shape without bulging, shrinking, or skewed angles?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tiers of the chocolate tower in Image B maintain a consistent vertical alignment, with each circular platform stacked directly above the one below. The spacing between tiers is uniform, contributing to a balanced and symmetrical conical silhouette. There is no evidence of bulging, shrinking, or angular skewing that would disrupt the intended geometric form. The tapering from bottom to top is gradual and mathematically consistent, reflecting a deliberate architectural design. Even at the zoomed-in view, the structural integrity remains intact, with no warping or misalignment. This precision suggests either careful physical construction or high-fidelity digital modeling, both of which support the preservation of the original conical shape.",
