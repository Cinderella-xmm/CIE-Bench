      "question": "Do the added text elements such as titles and headings appear seamlessly integrated into the scene without introducing unnatural textures or disrupting the surrounding design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in Image B, including 'Ideal Home' at the top, 'Bedroom Inspirations' on the left, 'Cozy Living' on the right, and the price guide at the bottom, are overlaid directly onto the image. These texts are rendered in a clean, sans-serif font with solid black and white colors that contrast sharply against the background. However, the text appears to be digitally superimposed without any blending or shadowing effects that would make it look like part of the physical environment. The edges of the text are crisp and lack any softening or depth cues that would integrate them naturally into the scene. In real-world magazine covers, such text is often designed to feel like part of the layout but still remains distinct from the photograph. Here, while the text does not introduce visible textures (like grain or noise), it stands out due to its flatness and lack of interaction with lighting or depth—such as shadows or reflections—making it appear somewhat artificial. Thus, though not disruptive in terms of texture, the integration lacks naturalness.",

      "question": "Are the proportions and placements of the newly added text elements appropriate, ensuring they do not distort the geometric shapes or disrupt the room’s layout?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The placement of the text elements follows typical magazine cover conventions: the main title 'Ideal Home' spans the top center, which is a common location for headlines. The side columns ('Bedroom Inspirations' and 'Cozy Living') are vertically aligned along the edges, resembling sidebar content seen in magazines. The bottom text block about pricing is centered and positioned over the bed, which is a logical area for informational content on a cover. The proportions of the text relative to the image are balanced—neither too large nor too small—and do not overlap critical structural elements like the bed frame or furniture in a way that distorts their shape. The text boxes are rectangular and aligned with the horizontal and vertical axes of the room, preserving the symmetry of the original composition. There is no visible warping or stretching of the underlying image geometry caused by the text overlay. Therefore, despite being visually prominent, the text maintains proper alignment and proportionality without distorting the spatial relationships within the room.",

      "question": "Does the style and material used for the text modules match the room's decor, maintaining a cohesive look without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bedroom in the image features a minimalist, modern aesthetic with neutral tones (beige, white, light wood), clean lines, and natural materials such as wood, fabric, and plants. The lighting is warm and soft, contributing to a calm and inviting atmosphere. The text elements, however, use bold, high-contrast typography—black and white sans-serif fonts—that are typical of magazine branding rather than interior design elements. While this style is effective for readability and visual impact, it contrasts with the subtle, organic feel of the room. For example, there are no decorative textures or finishes applied to the text to mimic materials like paper, wood, or fabric, which could have helped blend it into the environment. Instead, the text appears flat and digital, lacking any tactile quality that might align with the room’s natural and cozy ambiance. This mismatch makes the text feel more like an external graphic overlay than an integrated design feature. Hence, although functional, the text style does not harmonize with the room’s decor.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition of the magazine cover design elements, when placed over the bedroom image, seem visually credible and avoid unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition of the magazine cover elements—title, sidebars, and footer—is well-structured and mimics the layout of a real home design magazine cover. The text is clearly legible, evenly spaced, and strategically placed to draw attention without overwhelming the central image of the bedroom. There are no visible pixelation, blurring, or misalignment issues that would suggest poor editing. The text does not clip or bleed into areas where it shouldn’t, and the edges are sharp. However, the absence of subtle visual effects such as drop shadows, slight transparency, or gradient overlays means the text doesn’t interact realistically with the lighting in the scene. For instance, the 'Ideal Home' title casts no shadow on the ceiling or wall, which would be expected if it were physically present. Similarly, the text blocks don’t reflect ambient light or cast soft glows. While the composition is visually coherent and professional-looking, these missing realism cues make the design feel slightly artificial. That said, since this is intended to represent a magazine cover, some degree of stylization is acceptable. But from a photorealistic standpoint, the lack of environmental interaction introduces a sense of detachment.",

      "question": "Are the fine details within the added text elements (titles, headings, and price recommendations) preserved, ensuring their clarity and legibility without degradation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text elements in Image B—including 'Ideal Home', 'Bedroom Inspirations', 'Cozy Living', and 'Price Guide: Bedroom Essentials Under $500'—are rendered with high clarity. The font is sharp, with no visible pixelation, jagged edges, or blurring. The contrast between the text and the background is strong enough to ensure legibility even in areas with complex backgrounds, such as near the painting or the wooden headboard. The letterforms are consistent and properly scaled, with no distortion or scaling artifacts. The spacing between letters and lines is uniform, and all characters are fully formed and readable. This suggests that the text was likely added at a high resolution and carefully aligned during post-production. Given that the text is meant to convey information quickly and effectively on a magazine cover, its preservation of detail is crucial—and here, it meets those standards. There is no evidence of compression artifacts or loss of fidelity in the typography.",
