    "Question": "Q1: Does the woman's pose maintain anatomical proportion and joint alignment, with no distorted limbs or unnatural bending at the knee, hip, or spine?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the woman is performing a yoga pose that appears to be the Tree Pose (Vrikshasana). Her standing leg is straight, and her other leg is bent at the knee with the foot placed on the inner thigh of the standing leg. The arms are raised above the head in a prayer position. Observing the visual cues, there are no apparent distortions in limb proportions or unnatural bends at the joints. The knee, hip, and spine appear aligned as expected for this pose. Common sense suggests that such a pose should have these characteristics if performed correctly.",
