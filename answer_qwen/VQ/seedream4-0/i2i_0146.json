      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra consistent with its natural patterns without appearing as unnatural or disjointed lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes are clearly stylized and do not follow the natural, irregular, and flowing pattern seen in real zebras. Instead, the stripes are smooth, uniform, and geometrically regular, especially around the limbs and torso. Real zebra stripes vary in width, direction, and continuity, often forming complex, interconnected patterns that are unique to each individual. In contrast, the stripes in Image B appear artificially drawn, with sharp edges and repetitive symmetry that suggest a cartoonish or toy-like design rather than biological realism. This deviation from natural stripe patterns indicates that the stripes are not consistent with real zebra anatomy.",

      "question": "Do the zebra's ears maintain their natural upright position without any distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's ears are upright and pointed forward, which is typical of alertness in animals. However, they appear overly simplified and cartoonish—especially the inner ear structure, which lacks the fine detail and natural curvature seen in real zebras. The ears have a rigid, almost plastic-like appearance, suggesting they are part of a manufactured object rather than a living animal. While the positioning is anatomically plausible (upright), the overall form and texture indicate artificiality. Compared to real zebra ears, which are soft, flexible, and have visible cartilage and fur texture, these ears lack natural detail and exhibit a stylized, exaggerated shape. Thus, while the orientation is natural, the form is distorted in a way that suggests it is not a real zebra.",

      "question": "Does the zebra maintain realistic proportions in its limbs and body, avoiding any grossly exaggerated or distorted features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B has a significantly altered body structure compared to a real zebra. Its limbs are thick and blocky, particularly the legs, which end in solid black hooves that resemble toy feet rather than natural hooves. The body is compact and rounded, lacking the lean musculature and elongated neck typical of real zebras. Additionally, the head is disproportionately large relative to the body, and the torso appears shorter and more stubby. These features are characteristic of stylized or animated representations, such as children’s toys or cartoon characters. Real zebras have longer legs, a more slender build, and a proportionate head-to-body ratio. Therefore, the proportions in Image B are not realistic but instead exaggerated for stylistic purposes.",

      "question": "Is the texture of the zebra's coat smooth and free of unnatural artifacts or pixelation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the zebra's coat in Image B is uniformly smooth, with no visible fur, hair, or natural surface variation. Instead, the surface appears glossy and plastic-like, consistent with a synthetic material such as rubber or vinyl. There are no signs of individual hairs, shading gradients, or subtle textural imperfections that would be present in a real animal's coat. The edges of the stripes are perfectly sharp, suggesting digital rendering or 3D modeling rather than organic growth. While there is no pixelation (the image is high-resolution), the absence of natural texture and the presence of a reflective sheen indicate an artificial surface. Thus, although the image is clean, the texture is not biologically accurate.",

      "question": "Is the grass around the zebra unaltered and free of any editing artifacts, maintaining its natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B appears lush and green, with individual blades visible and a natural distribution. There are no obvious signs of digital cloning, repeating patterns, or unnatural color shifts that would indicate heavy editing. The lighting on the grass is consistent with the ambient light source, and shadows cast by the zebra are soft and realistic. The foreground grass is slightly blurred, creating a shallow depth of field effect that enhances realism. However, upon closer inspection, the grass near the zebra's feet seems slightly compressed or flattened, possibly due to the zebra being digitally placed into the scene. But overall, the grass maintains a natural appearance without visible artifacts. Unlike some edited images where grass shows repetition or unnatural alignment, this one appears well-integrated. Therefore, despite minor concerns about placement, the grass itself looks unaltered and natural.",
