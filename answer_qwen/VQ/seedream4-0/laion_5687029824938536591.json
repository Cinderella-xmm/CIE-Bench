      "question": "Are the triangular overlay shapes on the side of the shoe clearly defined and aligned correctly, without warped edges or missing segments?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The triangular overlay shapes on the side of the wooden shoe in Image B are visually distinct and follow the same geometric pattern as typical Salomon Speedcross designs. These overlays are carved into the wood with sharp, clean lines that align with the contours of the shoe's panels. There are no visible signs of warping, distortion, or missing segments; each triangle is fully formed and properly positioned relative to the adjacent sections. The craftsmanship appears meticulous, preserving the original structural design of the shoe while translating it into a three-dimensional wooden form. Given the precision of the carving and the symmetry observed across both sides of the shoe, the alignment is accurate and consistent with the intended design.",

      "question": "Do the wood grain lines flow naturally across the shoe's surface, following the contours of the panels and laces, without repeating or pixelated patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wood grain in Image B exhibits a natural, flowing pattern that follows the curves and structural elements of the shoe, such as the toe box, midfoot panels, and lace paths. The grain direction changes subtly to conform to the shoe’s complex 3D shape, indicating skilled craftsmanship. There are no obvious repeating patterns or artificial textures that suggest digital manipulation or tiling. Instead, the grain appears continuous and organic, with variations in density and coloration typical of real wood. This suggests that either high-quality wood was used or the carving process carefully mimicked natural grain flow. No pixelation or digital artifacts are present, reinforcing the impression of a physical object rather than a rendered image.",

      "question": "Are the laces depicted as solid wooden strands with consistent width and proper threading through the eyelets, maintaining their original path and tension?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the laces are carved from wood and appear as solid, rounded strands with uniform thickness throughout their length. They pass through the eyelets in a manner consistent with the original shoe’s lacing system, maintaining the correct diagonal crisscross pattern. The tension of the laces appears realistic—neither overly tight nor sagging—and they follow the expected curvature around the shoe’s upper. The threading is precise, with no gaps or misalignments at the eyelets. While wood cannot replicate the flexibility of real laces, the sculpted version effectively captures the visual essence of the original lacing structure, suggesting intentional and careful replication.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the darker and lighter wood tones create a clear distinction between the shoe's main body and highlights, such as the toe cap and midsole, without unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden shoe in Image B displays a range of wood tones, with darker areas emphasizing recessed sections like the midsole edges and undercuts, while lighter tones highlight raised surfaces such as the toe cap and panel ridges. This contrast enhances the three-dimensional appearance and mimics lighting effects seen in real-world objects. The transitions between tones are smooth and gradual, without abrupt or unnatural shifts that would suggest poor coloring or editing. The variation in tone appears consistent with how light interacts with curved wooden surfaces, indicating thoughtful finishing and possibly staining techniques that respect the material’s natural properties. Therefore, the tonal differentiation is effective and realistic.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the brand names and logos (e.g., \"Salomon\", \"Speedcross\", \"Contagrip\") clearly readable and accurately positioned on the shoe, with clean edges and no blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The text and logos on the wooden shoe in Image B are deeply carved into the surface, with crisp edges and legible lettering. The word 'Salomon' along the side, 'Speedcross' near the tongue, and 'Contagrip' on the outsole are all clearly visible and placed in positions consistent with the original shoe model. The font style and spacing match those of the actual product, and there is no blurring or smudging. The depth of the engraving provides good contrast against the surrounding wood, ensuring readability. Even small details like the 'LT' label on the heel are present and properly scaled. This indicates high precision in the carving process and attention to branding accuracy.",

      "question": "Does the outsole feature deep, well-defined treads and a reinforced toe cap, with consistent depth and spacing that matches the original shoe’s geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The outsole of the wooden shoe in Image B features prominent, deep treads that mirror the aggressive lug pattern characteristic of Salomon’s trail running shoes. The tread blocks are evenly spaced and maintain consistent depth across the sole, replicating the functional design of the original. The toe cap is visibly reinforced with a thicker, more robust structure compared to the rest of the outsole, matching the protective design of the real shoe. The overall geometry of the outsole, including the curvature and placement of lugs, aligns closely with the original model. The carving has preserved the technical aspects of the shoe’s sole, demonstrating a high level of detail and fidelity to the source design.",

      "question": "Is the wooden shoe placed on a clean, flat shelf with soft shadows beneath it, suggesting a stable and realistic display environment without floating or misaligned positioning?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wooden shoe in Image B is positioned on a white, flat shelf that appears clean and uncluttered. A soft shadow is cast beneath the shoe, extending slightly toward the back and right, indicating directional lighting from the front-left. This shadow adds depth and realism, confirming that the shoe is resting firmly on the surface rather than floating. The alignment of the shoe is straight and centered on the shelf, with no visible tilt or misplacement. The background is neutral and consistent, enhancing the focus on the object. All visual cues suggest a carefully staged, realistic display environment suitable for showcasing an artistic or sculptural piece.",
