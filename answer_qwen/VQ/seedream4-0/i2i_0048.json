      "question": "Are the stripes on the zebra sharp and distinct without any unnatural pixelation or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the zebra's stripes appear highly reflective and metallic, with a glossy surface that mimics chrome or polished metal. While the edges of the stripes are visually sharp in terms of contrast, their appearance is not natural—instead, they reflect light in a way that suggests artificial material rather than biological fur. The reflection creates highlights and distortions that are inconsistent with real zebra fur, which would absorb and diffuse light differently. This unnatural sheen introduces visual artifacts such as specular reflections and warped lighting effects, which can be interpreted as a form of digital artifacting or stylization. Therefore, although the stripes are clearly defined, their unnatural glossiness and reflection patterns indicate a departure from natural clarity.",

      "question": "Do the zebra's fur textures appear natural without any visible artificial streaks or patterns?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B does not have fur; instead, its body appears to be made of a reflective, metallic material. The surface shows smooth, polished contours with no signs of hair or natural texture. Instead of individual fur strands, there are broad, uniform bands of shine and reflection, suggesting a manufactured object. These reflections create artificial streaks and highlights that do not resemble organic fur. In contrast, real zebra fur has a soft, fibrous texture with slight variations in thickness and coloration along the stripes. The absence of such natural details and the presence of metallic sheen confirm that the texture is artificial.",

      "question": "Are the proportions of the zebra's body consistent and free from any geometric distortions like warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The zebra in Image B maintains anatomically plausible proportions overall—its head, neck, torso, legs, and tail align with typical zebra morphology. However, the metallic surface distorts the perception of depth and volume due to exaggerated reflections and highlights, especially on the flanks and hindquarters. These reflections suggest an uneven or non-uniform surface, potentially implying subtle warping or stretching of the model’s geometry to accommodate the reflective finish. While the silhouette is accurate, the rendering of the body surface introduces visual distortions that affect how the proportions are perceived. For example, the midsection appears slightly inflated due to light reflection, which may suggest minor geometric manipulation. Thus, while the basic shape is correct, the surface treatment introduces perceptual inconsistencies.",

      "question": "Does the relative position between the zebra and the background grassland remain unchanged and natural?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The relative position of the zebra in Image B compared to the background grassland appears consistent with natural spatial relationships. The zebra stands firmly on the grass, and the depth cues (such as perspective and shadow) suggest it is part of the scene. However, the introduction of a metallic platform in the foreground—a feature absent in typical savanna environments—introduces an artificial element that disrupts the natural setting. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the zebra do not fully align with those expected under natural sunlight conditions; the reflections on the zebra’s body suggest an external light source that may not match the ambient environment. While the zebra’s placement within the grassland seems plausible, the inclusion of man-made structures and inconsistent lighting implies a digitally altered composition, making the overall scene less natural despite correct positioning.",

      "question": "Are the grass blades and the zebra's hooves detailed and free from any loss of sharpness or introduction of noise?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grass in Image B is rendered with reasonable detail, showing individual blades and variation in color and height, consistent with a natural field. However, the zebra’s hooves lack fine textural detail; they appear smooth and reflective, matching the metallic nature of the rest of the body. Real zebra hooves are hard but have a rough, textured surface with wear patterns, which are absent here. Moreover, the interaction between the hooves and the grass is unrealistic—the reflection on the hoof surfaces suggests they are not in contact with the ground in a physically accurate manner. There is also some digital noise or artifacting visible at the edge where the zebra meets the grass, likely due to compositing. Thus, while the grass itself is well-rendered, the hooves suffer from loss of natural detail and introduce artificial elements.",
