      "question": "Do the simplified versions of the red motorcycle and blue truck maintain their key features without introducing unnatural textures or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the red motorcycle and blue truck are stylized into a cartoonish, sticker-like form. Despite the simplification, the core features of both vehicles are preserved: the motorcycle retains its sporty shape, dual headlights, front fairing, and exhaust pipe; the truck maintains its classic pickup design with a visible cab, bed, grille, and side mirror. The use of solid colors and clean lines avoids unnatural textures. While details like rust on the truck or complex reflections on the motorcycle are absent (as expected in a simplified style), there are no distortions such as warped shapes or inconsistent proportions. The overall forms remain recognizable and coherent with real-world vehicle designs, even in this playful representation. Therefore, the key features are maintained without introducing artifacts or distortions.",

      "question": "Does the rider's black gear retain its essential characteristics without unnatural alterations or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The rider in Image B is depicted in a simplified, cartoon style but still wears a full black helmet, jacket, gloves, and boots—consistent with standard motorcycle riding gear. The proportions are slightly exaggerated for stylistic effect (e.g., larger head, simplified limbs), but these changes do not compromise the recognizability of the gear. There are no unnatural textures, such as mismatched materials or inconsistent shading, and the silhouette clearly suggests protective clothing appropriate for motorcycling. Although facial features are minimal due to the cartoon style, the gear’s essential components are present and correctly positioned. This aligns with common sense about how riders dress for safety, even when stylized. Thus, the gear retains its essential characteristics without distortion.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the playful touches such as exaggerated proportions or expressive characteristics added without breaking the visual credibility or introducing artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B introduces several playful elements: the truck has a smiling face with eyes and cheeks on its windshield, giving it anthropomorphic traits; the rider has a simplified, almost emoji-like face inside the helmet; and both vehicles have rounded, exaggerated forms. These stylistic choices enhance the whimsical nature of the image. However, they do not break visual credibility because they are consistent within the cartoon aesthetic. The exaggerations (like the large eyes on the truck) are clearly intentional and serve a decorative purpose rather than creating confusion. No digital artifacts such as pixelation, clipping, or misaligned layers are visible. The overall composition remains cohesive and visually pleasing. Given that the goal appears to be a fun, sticker-style illustration, these expressive characteristics are appropriate and well-executed.",

      "question": "Is the thick white outline applied consistently around the sticker design without interfering with the clarity of the elements within?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The thick white outline surrounding the entire sticker in Image B is uniformly applied, following the contours of the motorcycle, truck, and rider. It creates a clean, cut-out effect typical of stickers or decals. Importantly, this outline does not overlap or obscure any critical details of the internal elements—such as the wheels, headlights, or facial features. The spacing between the outline and the inner content is consistent, ensuring that each component remains clearly visible. In graphic design, such outlines are used to enhance separation from backgrounds and improve legibility, especially on transparent surfaces. Here, the outline enhances rather than detracts from clarity, maintaining the integrity of all depicted objects.",

      "question": "Does the use of a solid flat color for the circular base, with the motorcycle or truck extending beyond it, achieve a dynamic effect without causing visual inconsistencies or loss of fine details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The circular red base beneath the vehicles in Image B serves as a grounding element, suggesting motion or a spotlight effect. While both the motorcycle and truck extend beyond the edge of this circle, this design choice contributes to a dynamic, energetic feel, implying forward movement. The solid flat color is consistent and free of gradients or texture, which aligns with the minimalist aesthetic of the artwork. Importantly, the extension beyond the circle does not cause any visual inconsistency—there are no clipping issues, jagged edges, or missing parts. Fine details like the tires, mirrors, and headlights remain intact and fully visible, even where they protrude. This technique is commonly used in iconography and stickers to create depth and focus without sacrificing clarity. Thus, the design achieves a dynamic effect while preserving detail and visual coherence.",
