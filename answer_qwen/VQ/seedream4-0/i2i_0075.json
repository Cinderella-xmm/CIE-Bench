      "question": "Does the fur texture on the side of the cat appear smooth and consistent with the texture on the front part without any unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the fur texture on the side of the cat appears smooth and consistent with the front part. The visual cues suggest a uniformity in the depiction of fur strands, which aligns with common knowledge about how fur should look in a stylized illustration. There are no visible artifacts or inconsistencies that would disrupt this uniformity.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the cat's front and side views proportionally aligned without any noticeable distortion or overlapping artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Analyzing the proportions in Image B, the front and side views of the cat appear to be aligned without noticeable distortion. The transition between the two views maintains a natural flow, suggesting careful attention to proportionality in the editing process. Comparing with Image A, where the cat is shown from a single perspective, the alignment in Image B seems plausible as it adheres to typical anatomical proportions of a cat.",

      "question": "Do the cat's eyes and ears retain their natural shape and detail, free from any visible artifacts or blurring?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The eyes and ears of the cat in Image B retain their natural shape and detail. The eyes are round and expressive, while the ears stand upright with visible inner details, consistent with what one would expect in a realistic or stylized depiction of a cat. There are no visible artifacts or blurring that would detract from their natural appearance.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Is there a continuous and natural transition where the front and side views of the cat meet, avoiding any broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The transition where the front and side views meet in Image B is continuous and natural. There are no broken geometric shapes or awkward intersections that would indicate poor editing. The meeting point is well-handled, maintaining the integrity of the cat's form. This suggests a thoughtful approach to combining the two perspectives.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Does the overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural, without introducing any unnatural bending or stretching of limbs?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall posture and positioning of the cat in the combined image remain plausible and natural. The limbs are not unnaturally bent or stretched, and the body maintains a relaxed pose consistent with a resting cat. This assessment is supported by comparing it with the original posture in Image A, where the cat also appears naturally positioned.",
