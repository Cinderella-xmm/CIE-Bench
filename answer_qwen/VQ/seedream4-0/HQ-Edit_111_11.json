      "question": "Does the fedora hat sit naturally on the man's head without visible misalignment, unnatural shadows, or clipping artifacts at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The fedora hat in Image B appears to be positioned correctly on the man's head. It sits at a slight angle, consistent with typical styling for such hats, especially in vintage or 1920s-themed settings. The brim casts a natural shadow over the forehead and eyes, which aligns with the lighting direction from above (likely from the chandelier). There are no visible clipping artifacts or jagged edges around the hat, suggesting it was seamlessly integrated into the scene. The shading and texture of the hat match the surrounding environment and lighting conditions, indicating careful rendering. No signs of misalignment or digital distortion are present.",

      "question": "Is the bowtie positioned correctly under the collar, with natural fabric folds and no floating or distorted edges, and does it match the era-appropriate design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bowtie in Image B is properly positioned under the man's shirt collar, centered and symmetrically tied, which is typical for formal attire in the 1920s. The pattern on the bowtie—dark with small decorative motifs—is consistent with fashion trends of that era. The fabric shows subtle folds and creases that suggest realistic material behavior under gravity and pressure. There are no floating edges or unnatural gaps between the bowtie and the shirt. The overall appearance is polished and coherent with the character’s formal dress code, reinforcing the authenticity of the period setting.",

      "question": "Are the wall decorations in the background composed of clear geometric patterns typical of art deco design, with proper alignment and no texture repetition or warping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background wall features bold geometric patterns characteristic of Art Deco design—specifically, angular lines, symmetry, and stylized motifs using red, black, gold, and cream colors. These elements are common in 1920s and 1930s interiors, particularly in speakeasies and jazz lounges. The patterns are aligned consistently across the wall panels, showing no obvious repetition or tiling artifacts. The perspective is maintained well, with no warping or distortion, suggesting professional rendering. The use of light and shadow enhances the three-dimensionality of the design without breaking visual continuity.",

      "question": "Do the figures in the background wear clothing consistent with 1920s fashion, with correct proportions, no overlapping or missing limbs, and natural fabric draping?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background figures in Image B are dressed in attire consistent with 1920s fashion: women wear flapper-style dresses with fringes, beading, and low necklines, while men are in tuxedos with bow ties. The clothing drapes naturally, with fabric folds that respond realistically to body shape and movement. All visible limbs are complete and proportionate; there are no instances of missing arms, legs, or overlapping anatomy. The positioning of the figures suggests social interaction, and their postures appear anatomically accurate. The rendering avoids common AI-generated anomalies like limb fusion or disproportionate limbs, maintaining visual coherence with the era’s style.",

      "question": "Do both hands holding the saxophone have exactly five fingers each, with natural positioning, visible knuckles, and no deformation or extra digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Both hands of the man playing the saxophone in Image B display five fingers each. The left hand is placed on the upper keys of the saxophone, with clearly defined fingers and visible knuckles, showing natural curvature and spacing. The right hand supports the lower part of the instrument, also with five distinct fingers, proper joint articulation, and realistic positioning. There are no extra digits, fused fingers, or deformations. The lighting highlights the contours of the hands, reinforcing the realism. This level of detail indicates high-quality modeling and attention to anatomical accuracy.",
