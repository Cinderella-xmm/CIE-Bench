    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the man’s clothing and headwrap are rendered with visible brushstrokes that follow a painterly style reminiscent of impressionistic or expressionistic techniques. The brushwork on the fabric patterns is generally consistent in direction, aligning with the natural folds and contours of the garments. The strokes appear to be applied with varying intensity, especially around the edges of the patterns, but they do not distort the underlying geometric shapes of the traditional African textile designs. Instead, the texture enhances the visual richness without breaking the integrity of the pattern. The colors remain distinct and layered appropriately, preserving the fabric’s structure. There are no signs of pixelation or smudging, which would suggest digital artifacts; instead, the brushstrokes contribute to a cohesive, artistic rendering. This consistency in technique supports the preservation of both shape and design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The background in Image B features a stylized, impressionistic landscape with warm yellow and orange tones. The horizon line is not sharply defined but rather blended through broad, directional brushstrokes that suggest depth and distance. While there is some variation in color saturation and stroke density, particularly near the distant hills and trees, the overall blur appears smooth and intentional. There are no jagged edges or double contours—common artifacts in poorly rendered digital edits—indicating that the blur was applied cohesively. The transitions between sky and land, as well as between foreground and background elements, are soft and continuous. The slight variations in tone are consistent with artistic interpretation rather than technical flaws. Therefore, the background maintains a uniform aesthetic continuity despite its abstracted form.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The drum in Image B is depicted with a clear circular top surface and a cylindrical body bound by horizontal ropes, typical of a djembe. The paint application follows the curvature of the drum, with strokes that mimic the natural tapering from top to bottom. The rim remains intact and consistently shaped, with no flattening or stretching that would suggest distortion. The vertical wooden staves of the drum are represented with parallel lines that curve slightly to match the drum's form, reinforcing its three-dimensional appearance. Paint layers appear to be applied in a way that respects the object’s geometry, maintaining the structural integrity of the instrument. There is no evidence of unnatural warping or flattening, indicating that the artist preserved the drum’s realistic proportions within the stylistic context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The grass and tree forms in the background of Image B are rendered in an expressive, elongated manner, with dynamic brushstrokes that suggest movement and wind. Despite this stylization, the trees maintain recognizable upright trunks and branching patterns, even if simplified. The grass appears to flow outward in curved lines, giving a sense of motion without losing its identity as vegetation. There are no fragmented or floating elements—each plant form connects logically to the ground or surrounding environment. The artistic exaggeration does not compromise structural coherence; instead, it enhances the scene’s emotional atmosphere while preserving the essential characteristics of flora. Thus, the stylization supports recognition without introducing disorientation or visual fragmentation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "Both hands in Image B display five distinct fingers, with visible separation and anatomical joint alignment that suggests a natural hand structure. The fingers are proportionally sized relative to the arms and the drum, and their positioning over the drum surface appears balanced and functional. While the brushwork adds texture and variation in shading, the individual digits remain clearly defined without being stretched or compressed. The spacing between fingers is consistent with human anatomy, and the joints are subtly indicated through tonal shifts and directional strokes. No digit appears distorted or merged with another, and the overall hand posture reflects a realistic playing gesture. Therefore, despite the artistic rendering, the hands retain anatomical accuracy and proportional integrity.",
    "answer": "Yes"
