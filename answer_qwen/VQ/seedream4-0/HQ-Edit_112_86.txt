    "Question": "Q1: Does the main body of the teapot appear as clear glass with visible internal reflections and refractions consistent with transparent material, without any opaque or metallic residue?",
    "explanation": "The main body of the teapot in Image B is made of a transparent material that exhibits characteristics typical of high-quality glass. The surface allows light to pass through, creating soft internal reflections and subtle refractions, especially noticeable around the edges and curves where light bends. There are no signs of opaque patches or metallic residue; instead, the glass appears uniformly translucent with frosted floral engravings. These engravings are embedded within the glass rather than applied on top, which is consistent with etched glass craftsmanship. The clarity of the base and the way it reflects the underlying surface (a mirrored tray) further confirm its transparency. This behavior aligns with real-world physics of light interaction with glass, particularly when it is frosted or etched but not colored or obscured.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Are the floral patterns on the glass surface uniformly frosted with no signs of smudging, uneven opacity, or artificial texture artifacts?",
    "explanation": "The floral patterns on the teapot in Image B are etched into the glass with a consistent frosted finish. The design includes roses, leaves, and vines, all rendered with uniform translucency. The frost effect is evenly distributed across the surface, suggesting a controlled etching process such as acid etching or sandblasting. There are no visible smudges, streaks, or irregularities in opacity that would suggest poor application or digital artifacting. The depth and clarity of the pattern remain consistent, with smooth transitions between engraved areas and the surrounding glass. This level of detail and uniformity is characteristic of professional glass engraving techniques, and there is no evidence of artificial textures or digital noise that might indicate post-processing flaws.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the handle and spout exhibit a consistent amber tint with smooth gradients and sharp boundaries, without color fringing or unnatural highlights?",
    "explanation": "The handle and spout of the teapot in Image B are made of an amber-colored glass material. The tint is consistent throughout both components, with gradual color transitions that follow the curvature of the glass—indicative of proper molding and annealing. The gradients are smooth, and the boundaries between the amber sections and the clearer glass body are sharp and well-defined. There is no visible color fringing (such as chromatic aberration), nor are there exaggerated or unnatural highlights that would suggest over-sharpening or incorrect lighting simulation. The reflections on the amber parts are realistic and match the expected behavior of light interacting with curved, semi-transparent materials. This suggests a high-quality rendering or photograph of a real object with accurate color representation.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the reflection under the teapot symmetrical, sharp, and correctly aligned with the object’s base, showing accurate contours and transparency effects?",
    "explanation": "The teapot in Image B is placed on a reflective surface, likely a glass or mirror tray. The reflection beneath it is clearly visible and shows a symmetrical image of the teapot’s base and lower portion. The contours of the reflection match those of the actual object, including the shape of the base, the curve of the handle, and the spout. The transparency of the glass body is accurately mirrored, with the frosted floral patterns appearing faintly in the reflection, just as they do on the original surface. The reflection is sharp and free from distortion, indicating that the surface is flat and highly reflective. There is no blurring, warping, or misalignment, which supports the conclusion that the reflection is physically accurate and properly rendered.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the proportions of the lid, spout, handle, and body preserved such that there are no stretched, compressed, or misaligned sections compared to the original?",
    "explanation": "To assess proportionality, we compare the structure of the teapot in Image B to what would be expected from a realistically designed glass teapot. The lid sits flush with the body, and its knob is centered and appropriately sized. The spout curves smoothly from the body and maintains a proportional length and thickness relative to the rest of the teapot. The handle is arched and balanced, connecting seamlessly to the body at both ends. All elements appear anatomically correct for a functional teapot. While Image A (the original) features a metallic teapot with different material properties, the overall silhouette and component placement in Image B are consistent with standard teapot design principles. There is no visual indication of stretching, compression, or misalignment—each part integrates naturally with the others. The symmetry and scale are maintained throughout, suggesting careful design and execution.",
    "answer": "Yes"
