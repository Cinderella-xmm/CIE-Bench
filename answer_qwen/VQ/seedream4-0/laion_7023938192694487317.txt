    "Question": "Q1: Does the torso appear uniformly scaled and proportionally enlarged without visible warping or stretching of anatomical features such as shoulders, neck, or waist?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the torso appears to be a stylized representation rather than a realistic human form. The shoulders are broad and slightly exaggerated, and the neck is proportionally shorter compared to typical human anatomy. The waist is not visible due to the truncation at the chest level, but the overall shape of the torso suggests a uniform scaling with some artistic exaggeration. However, there is no visible warping or stretching of the anatomical features—such as the shoulders or neck—that would suggest digital distortion. Instead, the proportions seem consistent with a sculpted bust model, where slight idealization is common. Given that this is a figurine or bust, the lack of natural anatomical variation (like tapering at the waist) is expected. Therefore, while not anatomically accurate, the scaling appears uniform and intentional, without signs of unnatural stretching.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Is the surface of the shirt uniformly matte with no glossy highlights or fabric weave patterns, indicating a polymer-like finish?",
    "explanation": "The surface of the shirt in Image B exhibits a smooth, reflective quality with distinct highlights, particularly on the shoulders and chest area. These highlights suggest a glossy or semi-gloss finish rather than a matte one. Additionally, there are no visible fabric weave patterns, which is consistent with a synthetic or polymer material like plastic or resin commonly used in figurines. The absence of texture and the presence of specular reflections indicate a non-textile, artificial surface. This contrasts with real clothing, which typically shows subtle texture and less uniform reflectivity. Thus, the surface is not matte but rather has a polished, polymer-like appearance.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the 'Craft' logo clearly visible, elevated in appearance, and rendered in bold colors without blurring, misalignment, or clipping at its edges?",
    "explanation": "The 'CRAFT' logo on the right shoulder of the shirt in Image B is clearly visible and positioned correctly. It appears sharp and well-defined, with clean edges and no blurring or misalignment. The text is rendered in white with a small dot pattern beneath it, consistent with the brand's design. While the logo does not appear physically raised (as it would on a real garment), it is digitally rendered with clarity and precision. There is no clipping or distortion at the edges, suggesting careful digital placement. The logo’s appearance is faithful to the original branding, even if it lacks physical elevation. Given that this is a 3D rendering, the logo’s clarity and alignment are maintained effectively.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the base under the figurine composed of clean, straight lines with smooth surfaces and subtle reflective highlights consistent with polished metal, and does it appear physically attached yet separable?",
    "explanation": "The base in Image B consists of a circular platform connected to a vertical rod, both exhibiting clean, straight lines and smooth surfaces. The material reflects light in a way that is consistent with polished metal, showing soft highlights and a mirror-like sheen. The junction between the rod and the base is seamless and precise, suggesting a manufactured connection. While the base appears permanently attached in the image, the clean separation line and lack of adhesive residue imply it could be designed for disassembly. Such bases are common in display models, where detachability allows for storage or transport. The overall aesthetic and material cues strongly support the conclusion that the base is made of polished metal and is both physically attached and potentially separable.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the facial features, including eyes, beard, glasses, and skin texture, preserved without distortion, blurring, or unnatural blending at the junction with the modified torso?",
    "explanation": "The facial features in Image B—eyes, beard, glasses, and skin texture—are highly detailed and closely resemble those in the original image. The eyes are clear and symmetrical, the beard is well-defined, and the glasses maintain their shape and position. The skin texture appears smooth and natural, without visible artifacts or pixelation. At the junction between the head and the torso, there is no evidence of unnatural blending or distortion; instead, the transition is clean and abrupt, consistent with a sculpted bust where the body is truncated. This sharp boundary is typical of figurines and does not indicate poor editing. The preservation of facial details suggests high-quality rendering, and the lack of blending artifacts confirms that the facial features were accurately transferred to the new form.",
    "answer": "Yes"
