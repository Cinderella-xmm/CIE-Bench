      "question": "Are the brass finishes on the ship’s hull and superstructure smooth and consistent in texture, with no visible cracks, pixelation, or mismatched shading?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B has been digitally altered to feature a steampunk aesthetic, with its hull and superstructure rendered in a golden-brass color. The surface appears uniformly textured with a metallic sheen, suggesting a deliberate artistic choice rather than a realistic depiction. Upon close inspection, the texture is consistent across the hull and deck, with no visible cracks or pixelation that would indicate poor rendering. The lighting reflects evenly across the surface, indicating smooth shading without abrupt transitions. While some areas may have slight variations due to intentional highlights or shadows for depth, these are consistent with 3D modeling techniques used in digital art. There is no evidence of mismatched shading or digital artifacts such as jagged edges or noise. Therefore, based on visual analysis and understanding of digital rendering standards, the brass finish appears intentionally smooth and consistent.",

      "question": "Do the metal automatons have five fingers per hand, properly articulated limbs, and clothing that conforms to the body shape without unnatural wrinkles or floating fabric?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, four humanoid automatons are present on the dock. Each automaton is constructed with a mechanical design featuring segmented limbs and joints, typical of steampunk-inspired robotics. Their hands appear to have five distinct fingers, each with articulation points, which aligns with human anatomy and common robotic design principles. The limbs are proportionally attached to the torso and show proper joint alignment (shoulders, elbows, knees), suggesting correct articulation. The clothing—such as coats, hats, and trousers—is modeled to fit the mechanical bodies, with folds and draping that follow natural physics. There are no signs of floating fabric or unnatural creases; instead, the garments appear anchored to the body structure, consistent with how cloth would behave on a rigid frame. This attention to detail indicates careful modeling and adherence to both anatomical and physical plausibility within the stylized context.",

      "question": "Is the glass lantern clearly defined around the scene, with transparent sides, visible metal framing, and no overlapping or missing sections that break the enclosure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The central element in Image B is a large glass lantern that encloses the entire ship and part of the dock. The lantern has a cylindrical shape with a clear glass body, allowing visibility into the interior while maintaining structural integrity. Metal framing is visible along the edges and supports, forming a continuous, symmetrical structure. The top features a copper-colored dome with hinges and handles, consistent with traditional lantern designs. The transparency of the glass is uniform, with no opaque patches or distortions. Importantly, there are no gaps or missing sections in the enclosure—the glass seamlessly connects to the metal framework at all points. Even though the lantern appears to be an artificial addition, it is rendered with precise geometry and consistent proportions, ensuring that it functions as a complete, enclosed space. No overlapping elements or breaks in the structure compromise its integrity.",

      "question": "Are the steam clouds rendered with smooth gradients and soft edges, appearing to float naturally within the lantern without jagged borders or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Inside the glass lantern, steam is emitted from the ship's smokestack, forming clouds that rise upward. The steam is rendered with soft, diffused edges and smooth gradients transitioning from white to light gray, mimicking real-world vapor behavior. There are no sharp, jagged outlines that would suggest low-resolution rendering or poor anti-aliasing. The density of the steam varies appropriately—thicker near the source and dissipating as it rises—consistent with atmospheric dispersion. The color remains within a natural range of whites and grays, without unnatural hues or sudden shifts. Furthermore, the steam does not intersect improperly with the lantern’s structure; it appears to be contained within the glass enclosure, floating naturally without clipping through surfaces. These visual cues indicate high-quality digital compositing and attention to volumetric rendering techniques.",

      "question": "Are the compasses and flags placed in logical positions relative to the ship and dock, with proper orientation and size that does not distort the spatial relationships between objects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Two large compasses are mounted on either side of the glass lantern, extending outward from its frame. They are positioned symmetrically and at a height that makes them visually balanced with the ship and dock. Their size is exaggerated compared to real-world compasses but fits within the fantastical, steampunk theme where scale is often stylized. The orientation of the compasses is consistent with cardinal directions, with north aligned toward the top of the image, which is logical given the sky and horizon line. The flags on the ship’s masts are also correctly oriented—flying with the wind—and their placement matches standard maritime practice. Although the overall scene is surreal due to the lantern and automatons, the relative positioning of the compasses and flags maintains plausible spatial logic. No object overlaps incorrectly or appears disproportionately scaled in a way that disrupts depth perception. Thus, despite the fantasy elements, the layout respects basic principles of spatial coherence.",

      "question": "Are the rotating gears and mechanical components attached to the ship’s structure with visible supports, and do they follow the contours of the hull and deck without floating or intersecting incorrectly?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ship in Image B is adorned with numerous mechanical components, including gears, pipes, and pistons, all integrated into its structure. These elements are attached via visible mounts, brackets, and shafts that connect them firmly to the hull and deck, suggesting structural integration rather than floating attachments. The gears vary in size and are arranged in functional-looking configurations, with smaller ones meshing with larger ones, consistent with mechanical engineering principles. They follow the curvature of the ship’s deck and hull, conforming to the underlying shape without intersecting through solid surfaces. For example, the gear assemblies are embedded within raised platforms or housing units, preventing them from passing through walls or decks. There are no instances of components floating mid-air or penetrating the ship’s body without support. This level of detail indicates careful 3D modeling and adherence to mechanical design logic, even within a fictional context.",
