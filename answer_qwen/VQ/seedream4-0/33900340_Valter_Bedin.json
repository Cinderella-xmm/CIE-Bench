      "question": "Do the archways in the tower appear as articulated limbs with natural joint-like transitions, preserving their original arch shape and avoiding unnatural bends or breaks in geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the structure that was originally a tower with archways in Image A has been transformed into a colossal golem-like figure. The archways are no longer present as architectural elements; instead, they have been reimagined as parts of the golem's anatomy—specifically, its limbs. The arches now form the arms and legs of the figure, with the curved shapes resembling joints at the elbows and knees. These transitions are smooth and anatomically plausible for a mechanical being, maintaining the curvature of the original arches while adapting them into limb structures. There are no abrupt breaks or unnatural bends; rather, the geometry flows naturally from one segment to another, suggesting a deliberate artistic transformation that preserves the essence of the original arch form. This indicates that the archways have been successfully repurposed into articulated limbs without distorting their fundamental shape.",

      "question": "Are the glowing glyphs evenly distributed across the stone surface, matching the texture of the original masonry and lacking jagged edges, pixelation, or abrupt color shifts that suggest digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glowing glyphs on the golem’s body in Image B are rendered with a soft, luminous quality that appears integrated into the stone surface. They are distributed across the torso, arms, and legs in a way that follows the contours of the armor-like segments, suggesting an intentional design rather than random placement. The glow is consistent in intensity and emits a subtle light that enhances the texture of the stone without creating harsh contrasts or sharp edges. There is no visible pixelation or jaggedness, and the transition between the dark stone and the illuminated symbols is smooth, indicating high-quality rendering. The glyphs resemble ancient inscriptions, possibly inspired by mythological or esoteric scripts, which adds to their authenticity within the scene. Their integration into the surface suggests careful attention to detail, avoiding any digital artifacts that might compromise realism.",

      "question": "Is the transition from dark shadowed areas to the mystical aura around the structure gradual and continuous, without sharp discontinuities or floating light effects that lack grounding?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B shows a clear gradient from the dark, shadowed base of the golem to the faintly glowing aura emanating from its lower body and extending toward the path below. This glow subtly interacts with the ground, creating a soft illumination along the path where the luminous guide wisp appears. The transition between shadow and light is smooth, with no sudden jumps in brightness or artificial halos that would suggest poor compositing. The glow seems to originate from within the structure itself, particularly near the feet and hands, giving it a grounded, organic feel. There are no floating light effects disconnected from the environment; instead, the light appears to be part of the scene’s atmosphere, enhancing the mystical tone without breaking immersion. The continuity of the light field supports the perception of a coherent, three-dimensional space.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the luminous guide wisp occupy the same position as the original figure and dog, maintaining proportional scale and spatial alignment, while exhibiting a translucent, wispy texture without solid edges or anatomical features?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image A, a human figure walking a small dog is visible in the distance, positioned near the center of the pathway leading toward the tower. In Image B, this figure and dog have been replaced by a luminous, ethereal wisp located in the same approximate position along the path. The wisp maintains the correct spatial relationship to the golem and the surrounding landscape, appearing smaller in scale relative to the giant figure, which preserves the depth and perspective of the scene. The wisp is composed of soft, flowing light with no defined edges or anatomical details—its form is abstract and translucent, resembling a ghostly presence or spirit. It lacks solidity and does not have limbs or facial features, aligning with the description of a 'wisp.' Its placement directly corresponds to where the original figure stood, ensuring continuity in composition while transforming the subject into a symbolic element.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the foreground, midground, and background elements still perceptually layered with correct depth relationships, so that the golem appears to stand within the space rather than floating above or behind it?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the golem is positioned centrally in the frame, towering over the landscape. The foreground consists of grassy terrain and a winding path that leads up to the golem’s feet, establishing a clear sense of depth. The midground includes the lower portion of the golem’s legs and the glowing wisp on the path, which anchors the figure to the ground. The background features a distant horizon line with rolling hills under a muted sky, providing context and scale. The golem’s feet rest firmly on the ground, and there is no visual evidence of floating or disconnection from the terrain. Shadows cast beneath the figure and the interaction of light with the surrounding environment reinforce its physical presence within the space. The layering of elements—from the immediate foreground to the distant background—is consistent with real-world depth cues, making the golem appear embedded in the environment rather than superimposed upon it.",
