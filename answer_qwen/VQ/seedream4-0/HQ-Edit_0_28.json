      "question": "Are the abstract geometric patterns on the man's robe seamlessly integrated into the fabric without introducing visible texture mismatches, jagged edges, or unnatural color shifts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the man's robe features a stylized, abstract geometric pattern composed of angular shapes in earthy tones such as beige, brown, and orange. These patterns are clearly part of a deliberate artistic design rather than realistic textile rendering. The integration of these patterns into the fabric appears intentional and consistent with the overall illustrative style of the image. There are no visible jagged edges or abrupt transitions between colors that would suggest digital artifacts. Instead, the patterns follow clean lines and maintain uniformity in stroke width and color gradient, which is typical of vector-based illustrations. The texture of the robe lacks fine details like weave or fabric folds, but this is expected given the stylized nature of the artwork. Therefore, while not photorealistic, the patterns are smoothly integrated within the artistic context, avoiding visual mismatches. This conclusion is based on the coherence of the design language across the entire figure and background.",

      "question": "Do the transformed lamp bases retain recognizable brass-like material properties and maintain proportional geometry consistent with their original structure when stylized as corner flourishes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lamp bases have been artistically reimagined as decorative corner flourishes that frame the image. While they retain the general silhouette and tiered form of traditional brass lamps, their transformation includes ornamental swirls and filigree elements that extend beyond the original structure. However, despite this stylization, the golden hue and reflective highlights suggest an attempt to preserve the brass-like appearance. The proportions of the base components—such as the stem, foot, and support—are still discernible and scaled appropriately relative to the rest of the scene. The transition from functional object to decorative motif is smooth, maintaining a sense of continuity in material and form. This reflects a common practice in illustrative art where real-world objects are adapted into symbolic or decorative elements while preserving core identity. Thus, even though they are no longer literal lamps, they retain enough structural and material cues to be recognized as stylized versions of brass lamps.",

      "question": "Is the extended portion of the bookcase visually continuous with the original section, showing consistent shelf spacing, book alignment, and lighting without visible seams or distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the bookcase behind the man appears to be digitally extended beyond its original bounds, particularly on the right side. Upon close inspection, the shelf spacing remains regular and matches the left side of the bookcase. The books are aligned consistently, both in height and placement, suggesting careful attention to symmetry. Lighting across the bookcase is uniform, with soft shadows indicating a single light source from the front-left (consistent with the lamps). There are no visible seams, sharp edges, or distortions that would indicate a patchwork or poorly blended extension. The continuation of the wooden paneling and the repeating pattern of book spines contribute to a seamless visual flow. This suggests that the extension was carefully designed to match the original aesthetic and structural logic of the bookcase, likely using digital replication techniques to maintain consistency.",

      "question": "Are the script elements embedded within the bookcase surface rendered with appropriate transparency and scale so they do not obscure books or create unnatural layering effects?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The script elements on the bookcase surface in Image B appear as faint, cursive handwriting overlaid on the background wall and extending partially onto the bookshelf panels. These scripts are rendered with low opacity and a subtle sepia tone, ensuring they do not dominate or block the visibility of the books behind them. Their scale is small and consistent with the size of handwritten text, and they are positioned in areas where they do not interfere with the central focus—the books and the figure. The layering is handled such that the books remain clearly defined and legible, with the script serving more as a decorative or thematic element rather than a foreground obstruction. This use of transparency and strategic placement aligns with common graphic design practices for adding texture without disrupting primary visual content. Therefore, the script does not create unnatural layering or occlusion.",

      "question": "Does the area intended for inspirational quotes display a clean, unobstructed region with consistent lighting and texture that allows for future text placement without visual disruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, there is a clearly designated space on the desk in front of the man, where a piece of paper lies flat with placeholder text reading 'Lire tout y ouvert cherchez la verité ici et ailleurs.' This area is centered, well-lit, and free from overlapping objects or shadows that could interfere with readability. The texture of the paper is slightly textured but uniform, matching the vintage aesthetic of the scene. The surrounding elements—such as the open books and lamp—do not intrude upon this space, and the lighting remains consistent across the surface. This suggests that the area has been intentionally designed as a focal point for textual content, possibly for dynamic quote insertion in future uses. Given the clarity, balance, and absence of visual noise, it is suitable for adding new text without disruption.",
