      "question": "Does the giant manta ray seamlessly replace the surfboard, maintaining the surfer’s pose without unnatural distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the surfer is still standing on a surfboard, which remains visible beneath him. The giant manta ray is positioned above the surfer, not replacing the surfboard. The surfer's pose appears natural and undistorted, as he maintains balance on the board. The manta ray does not interact with or substitute for the surfboard in any way. Therefore, the manta ray does not replace the surfboard, and there is no distortion of the surfer’s pose due to such replacement. This conclusion is based on visual inspection: the surfboard is clearly present and intact, and the surfer's posture is consistent with normal surfing behavior.",

      "question": "Have the dreamy atmosphere effects been integrated smoothly, enhancing the image without creating unnatural artifacts or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The edited image includes glowing, ethereal light effects around the manta ray, particularly along its edges, giving it a dreamy, almost supernatural appearance. These effects are visually prominent but do not appear to disrupt the overall composition. However, the glow around the manta ray has a somewhat artificial quality—specifically, the light halo appears overly sharp and uniform, lacking the soft diffusion typical of natural atmospheric lighting. Additionally, the brightness around the manta ray contrasts sharply with the surrounding sky and ocean, creating a sense of digital enhancement rather than organic integration. While the effect adds a surreal mood, it introduces noticeable artifacts that detract from realism. Thus, while the atmosphere is enhanced, the integration is not seamless.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the interaction between the manta ray and the waves visually credible, avoiding any apparent breaks in texture or geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The manta ray is depicted flying above the wave, hovering in mid-air with no physical contact with the water or the wave surface. In reality, manta rays are marine animals that swim underwater and cannot fly or hover above waves. The image shows the manta ray suspended in air, with no visible support or fluid dynamics suggesting lift or movement through air. Furthermore, the wave beneath the surfer appears unaffected by the presence of the large creature, which would be physically implausible if the manta ray were truly interacting with the environment. There is also a clear discontinuity in texture—where the manta ray meets the sky, there is an abrupt edge with no blending into the background. This suggests a lack of geometric continuity and realistic interaction with the scene. Hence, the interaction is not visually credible.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Does the size and shape of the manta ray align naturally with the scale of the surfboard and surfer, avoiding disproportionate or unrealistic scaling?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The manta ray in Image B is significantly larger than the surfer and the surfboard. For context, a typical adult manta ray can reach up to 7 meters (about 23 feet) in width, which is already massive. However, the manta ray here appears to be several times larger than that, possibly spanning over 10–15 meters across, making it disproportionately huge compared to the human figure. The surfer, who is about 1.7–1.8 meters tall, appears minuscule in comparison. Such a scale difference is unrealistic even within a fantastical context, as it defies known biological proportions. Moreover, the manta ray’s wingspan dwarfs the entire wave, which is uncharacteristic of real-world physics and scale relationships. Therefore, the scaling is highly exaggerated and unnatural.",

      "question": "Are the textures and edges of the manta ray free of visible artifacts, maintaining smooth transitions and natural details?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Upon close inspection, the manta ray exhibits some visible artifacts. Its edges are highlighted with a bright, glowing aura that lacks natural gradation, appearing more like a digital outline or lens flare effect. This glow is inconsistent with how light interacts with real surfaces and suggests post-processing manipulation. Additionally, the skin texture of the manta ray, while detailed, shows signs of smoothing or oversaturation, especially near the head and dorsal side, where the shading appears unnaturally uniform. There are subtle jagged lines along the wingtips and tail, indicating possible pixelation or low-resolution blending during editing. These elements suggest that the manta ray was digitally inserted and not rendered with full photorealism, resulting in visible artifacts and disrupted natural transitions.",
