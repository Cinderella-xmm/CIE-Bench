      "question": "Does the facade of the theater building appear composed of uniform tan LEGO bricks with brown accents, without visible seams, irregular patterns, or unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facade of the theater building in Image B is clearly composed of LEGO bricks, as indicated by the visible studs and uniform block shapes. The tan color with brown accents is consistent throughout, and there are no visible seams or irregular patterns that would suggest a non-LEGO construction. The texture is characteristic of LEGO bricks, which have a distinct, uniform appearance.",

      "question": "Are the three large arched windows replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes that preserve the arch shape but feature a regular grid pattern, without distortion or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The three large arched windows in Image B are indeed replaced with translucent square LEGO-style panes. These panes maintain the arch shape through a careful arrangement of LEGO pieces that form the grid pattern. There is no distortion or misalignment; the grid pattern is regular and fits within the arch structure seamlessly.",

      "question": "Do the \"Walgreens\" and \"Marina Theater\" signs show letters constructed from smooth red flat LEGO bricks, maintaining legibility and alignment with the awning structure?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The signs for 'Walgreens' and 'Marina Theater' in Image B are constructed from red LEGO bricks. The letters are smooth and flat, typical of LEGO construction, and they align well with the awning structure. The legibility is maintained despite the LEGO style, as the letters are clearly distinguishable and properly spaced.",

      "question": "Are both vintage cars rendered as blocky LEGO vehicles with simplified shapes, including rectangular bodies, circular wheels, and flat surfaces, without retaining realistic car features like curved fenders or chrome trim?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vintage cars in Image B are rendered in a blocky LEGO style. They feature simplified shapes with rectangular bodies and circular wheels, typical of LEGO vehicles. Realistic features like curved fenders or chrome trim are absent, as these details cannot be accurately represented with LEGO's blocky nature.",

      "question": "Do the LEGO-style cars and building maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment, with no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO-style cars and building in Image B maintain proper scale and alignment with each other and the surrounding environment. The cars are positioned correctly on the street, and the building's proportions are consistent with its surroundings. There are no floating parts, misaligned bricks, or unnatural spacing, indicating a well-executed LEGO conversion.",
