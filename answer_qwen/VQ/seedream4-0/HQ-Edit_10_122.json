      "question": "Does the patterned textile on the character’s top display coherent geometric shapes, consistent color gradients, and natural fabric-like texture without visible distortions or repeating digital artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterned textile on the character’s top in Image B displays a variety of geometric shapes that appear coherent and consistent. The color gradients seem smooth, transitioning naturally between different hues. The texture looks like fabric with no visible distortions or digital artifacts. The analysis is based on observing the continuity and natural appearance of the patterns and colors.",

      "question": "Are the tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces clearly defined, proportionally accurate, and free from distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tribal motifs on the gold earrings and necklaces in Image B are clearly defined with intricate details. They appear proportionally accurate relative to the character's head and body. There are no distorted edges or unrealistic surface reflections; the metallic sheen is consistent with how gold jewelry typically appears. This conclusion is drawn from examining the clarity and realism of the jewelry design.",

      "question": "Do the abstracted umbrellas in the background maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships, without overlapping or floating inconsistently relative to the market stalls?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The abstracted umbrellas in the background of Image B maintain plausible proportions and spatial relationships. They do not overlap unnaturally or float inconsistently relative to the market stalls. Each umbrella seems anchored in its place, contributing to a believable market scene. This assessment is made by analyzing the spatial arrangement and coherence of the umbrellas within the scene.",

      "question": "Are the musical notes distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories around the character’s head, without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs in their paths?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The musical notes around the character’s head in Image B are distributed evenly and positioned along plausible trajectories. Their paths are smooth without sharp breaks or abrupt cutoffs, creating a harmonious visual effect. This observation is based on tracing the flow and placement of the musical notes in relation to the character’s head.",

      "question": "Does the character’s right hand show five fingers with correct proportions, natural curvature, and realistic skin texture, without any missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The character’s right hand in Image B shows five fingers with correct proportions and natural curvature. The skin texture appears realistic, with no missing, duplicated, or misshapen digits. The hand looks anatomically correct and well-rendered, which is determined by closely inspecting the hand's structure and detail.",
