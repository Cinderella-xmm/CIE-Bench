      "question": "Does the soccer ball retain its natural hexagonal pattern and smooth texture after being transformed into a halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the soccer ball has been stylized using a halftone pop-art filter, which is characterized by dot patterns and high-contrast outlines. While the underlying hexagonal and pentagonal pattern of the soccer ball is still recognizable due to the distinct shapes and their arrangement, the smooth texture of the original ball is replaced with a stippled, grainy appearance typical of halftone art. This technique breaks down continuous tones into dots, creating a textured effect that deviates from the natural smoothness of a real soccer ball. Therefore, although the geometric structure is preserved in form, the tactile quality (smooth texture) is lost. The transformation prioritizes artistic style over realism.",

      "question": "Are the glittering effects on the goalpost converted into the halftone pop-art style without creating unnatural textures or losing detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The goalpost in Image B features a sparkling, glitter-like effect that has been rendered through the halftone pop-art style. The glitter points are represented as bright dots and starbursts, consistent with the halftone aesthetic. However, this stylization results in a somewhat exaggerated and artificial appearance, where individual sparkles appear as isolated clusters of dots rather than cohesive reflections. While the general idea of sparkle is preserved, the transition from realistic glint to halftone dots introduces a loss of fine detail and creates a more cartoonish, less natural texture. The visual effect remains visually striking but sacrifices photorealistic fidelity for stylistic impact.",

      "question": "Do the proportions of the soccer ball and the goalpost remain consistent and physically plausible after applying the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the relative sizes and spatial relationships between the soccer ball and the goalpost appear consistent with real-world proportions. The ball is positioned in front of the goalpost and appears appropriately scaled—neither oversized nor undersized. The perspective and depth cues suggest a plausible three-dimensional scene. Although the halftone effect adds stylistic distortions like bold outlines and color gradients, these do not alter the fundamental scale or proportionality of the objects. Thus, despite the artistic transformation, the physical plausibility of the composition is maintained.",

      "question": "Are the geometric shapes of the soccer ball and the netting of the goalpost preserved without distortion in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The soccer ball retains its characteristic pentagonal and hexagonal panels, and the netting of the goalpost maintains its grid-like structure. These shapes are clearly defined in Image B, even though they are outlined with thick black lines and filled with halftone dots. The geometric integrity of both objects is preserved; however, the edges are slightly emphasized and exaggerated due to the pop-art style, which can create a sense of stylized rigidity. Despite this, there is no significant warping or deformation of the shapes themselves. The net’s square mesh remains regular, and the ball’s panel layout is accurate. Therefore, while the presentation is stylized, the core geometry is not distorted.",

      "question": "Does the overall composition and layout of the soccer ball and goalpost maintain visual credibility without introducing obvious artifacts in the halftone pop-art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The overall composition in Image B places the soccer ball in front of the goalpost, mimicking a realistic setup seen in sports photography. The lighting and shadows are stylized but still convey depth and positioning. The halftone effect is applied uniformly across the image, preserving the spatial relationship between the objects. There are no visible rendering errors such as misaligned elements, floating parts, or inconsistent scaling. The vibrant colors and dynamic outlines enhance the visual appeal without disrupting the logical layout. While the style is highly artistic, it does not introduce noticeable artifacts that break the visual coherence. Thus, the composition remains credible within the context of pop-art stylization.",
