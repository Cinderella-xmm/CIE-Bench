      "question": "Is the head of the character significantly larger than the body, with smooth, consistent scaling across facial features and neck, avoiding jagged edges or inconsistent proportions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character is depicted in a chibi or kawaii art style, which is characterized by exaggerated proportions where the head is disproportionately large compared to the body. This is a common stylistic choice in cartoon and anime-inspired designs to convey cuteness. The head is indeed significantly larger than the body, which aligns with typical chibi aesthetics. The facial features—such as the eyes, cheeks, and mouth—are uniformly scaled and smoothly rendered, with no jagged edges or inconsistencies in proportion. The neck is short and blends seamlessly into the head and shoulders, maintaining the stylized look without distortion. Therefore, based on visual cues and knowledge of chibi art conventions, the head is oversized but proportionally consistent within the intended artistic style.",

      "question": "Are the black outlines around the character's body and costume elements consistently thick, clean, and free of smudging or irregularities that suggest poor rendering?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The black outlines in Image B are clearly visible and define the character’s shape and costume details. These outlines are uniformly thick and follow the contours of the character’s body, cape, and suit elements (like the 'S' symbol, belt, and boots). There are no visible smudges, feathering, or irregularities in the line work, indicating high-quality rendering. The outline appears crisp and well-defined, especially around curved areas like the arms, legs, and head, suggesting professional digital design. This consistency is typical of vector-based illustrations or high-resolution digital art used for merchandise such as magnets or stickers. No signs of pixelation or blurring are present, reinforcing the clean rendering.",

      "question": "Is the \"S\" symbol on the chest clearly visible, using bright red and yellow colors with no blurring, color distortion, or loss of definition at the edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The 'S' symbol on the chest in Image B is prominently displayed and uses the classic Superman color scheme: a bright red background with a bold yellow 'S'. The edges of the symbol are sharp and well-defined, with no visible blurring or color bleeding. The contrast between the red and yellow is strong, and the inner details of the 'S' are cleanly rendered. The symbol maintains its integrity even at the corners and curves, showing no distortion or loss of definition. This clarity suggests high-quality digital artwork, likely designed for print or display purposes. The use of solid, vibrant colors without gradients or noise further supports the conclusion that the symbol is clearly visible and properly rendered.",

      "question": "Are the blue and red colors in the suit and cape uniformly vibrant and saturated, with no visible color banding, halos, or unnatural transitions between hues?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue of the suit and the red of the cape in Image B are both highly saturated and visually vibrant, consistent with the iconic Superman color palette. The colors appear uniform across the surface of the costume, with no visible color banding (striping due to low color depth) or halos (artifacts from anti-aliasing or blending errors). Transitions between colors—such as at the edges of the cape, the belt, and the boots—are clean and sharp, with no softening or unnatural gradients. The lighting effect on the suit, while stylized, does not introduce any unnatural hue shifts. Overall, the color application is consistent and professional, indicative of a well-rendered digital illustration suitable for physical products like magnets.",

      "question": "Do the hands of the character have exactly five fingers each, with natural-looking shapes and spacing, and are the arms and legs proportionally shortened without broken joints or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the character’s hands are stylized in a chibi fashion, with simplified forms. Each hand has five fingers, though they are small, rounded, and not anatomically detailed. The spacing between fingers is even and symmetrical, which is typical for this art style. While the fingers are not realistic, they are consistent with the overall aesthetic and do not appear broken or malformed. The arms and legs are proportionally shortened relative to the oversized head, which is characteristic of chibi design. There are no visible joint breaks or unnatural bends; the limbs are straight and symmetrically positioned. The elbows and knees are slightly bent but remain within the bounds of acceptable stylization. Thus, while not anatomically accurate, the limbs are proportionally correct within the context of the chibi style and lack any rendering flaws.",
