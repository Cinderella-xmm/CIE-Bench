      "question": "Are the knitted textures on the cardigan visibly exaggerated but still consistent with real knitting patterns, without broken stitches or irregular loops?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the knitted texture of the cardigan is highly detailed and features prominent cable knit patterns. While the texture appears more pronounced and stylized than typical real-world knitting—possibly due to artistic enhancement or painterly rendering—the overall structure adheres closely to authentic knitting techniques. The cables are symmetrical, continuous, and follow logical knitting patterns (such as twisted strands forming braided motifs), which suggests consistency with real knitting designs. There are no visible broken stitches or irregular loops; each strand flows smoothly into the next. The exaggeration lies in the depth and definition of the texture, likely enhanced for visual impact in a painted or digitally rendered style, but it remains within plausible representation. This aligns with common artistic practices where realism is preserved while emphasizing texture for aesthetic effect.",

      "question": "Do the buttons exhibit metallic sheen with realistic highlights and shadows that match the surrounding fabric and ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The buttons on the cardigan in Image B appear to be made of a reflective material, possibly metal or polished resin. They display subtle highlights and soft shadows consistent with directional lighting from above and slightly to the front-left, matching the illumination on the face and clothing. The reflections are smooth and circular, suggesting a convex surface typical of button design. However, the sheen is somewhat muted and lacks sharp specular reflections, which might indicate an intentional stylistic choice to blend with the painterly texture rather than achieve photorealism. Despite this, the lighting logic is coherent: highlights are positioned logically on the upper-right side of the buttons, and shadows fall appropriately on the lower-left, aligning with the ambient light direction seen across the scene. Therefore, while not hyper-realistic, the metallic appearance is believable and harmonizes with the environment.",

      "question": "Does the color of the cardigan maintain a warm tone that complements the vintage floral wallpaper without introducing unnatural color shifts or contrast mismatches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cardigan in Image B has a rich, earthy brown hue with golden undertones, characteristic of a warm-toned woolen garment. This color palette harmonizes well with the vintage floral wallpaper, which features soft beige, peach, and muted pink tones accented by greenery. The warmth of the cardigan enhances the nostalgic, cozy atmosphere suggested by the background. There are no abrupt color transitions or jarring contrasts between the cardigan and the wallpaper. Instead, the colors blend seamlessly, creating a unified visual tone. The lighting also contributes evenly, avoiding any unnatural shifts such as blue cast or overly saturated patches. This balance reflects careful color coordination typical of traditional portraiture or interior scenes aiming for harmony. Thus, the cardigan’s color supports the overall aesthetic without disruption.",

      "question": "Is the embroidery on the frame clearly defined, properly aligned with the frame edges, and free from floating or misaligned threads?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The embroidery on the frames in Image B is intricately detailed, featuring floral motifs and decorative borders. Upon close inspection, the stitching appears crisp and well-defined, with individual threads distinguishable yet cohesive. The patterns follow the rectangular shape of the frames precisely, maintaining alignment along all four edges. There are no visible floating threads or misplaced stitches that would suggest poor craftsmanship or digital artifacting. The symmetry and repetition of the embroidery elements—such as flowers and vines—are consistent, indicating deliberate design. Furthermore, the texture of the embroidery blends naturally with the canvas-like surface, suggesting it was rendered with attention to textile realism. Given these observations, the embroidery is both visually accurate and technically sound within the context of a painted or stylized image.",

      "question": "Is the canvas texture evenly distributed across the entire image, preserving fine details such as hair, facial lines, and fabric weave without blurring or obscuring them?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B exhibits a distinct canvas texture that overlays the entire composition, giving it a painterly, oil-on-canvas appearance. This texture is consistent in density and grain across the image, including the background, clothing, and facial features. Importantly, despite the presence of this texture, fine details remain discernible: the individual strands of the man’s white hair, the wrinkles around his eyes and forehead, the knit pattern of the sweater, and even the delicate embroidery on the frames are all preserved. The texture does not blur or obscure these elements but rather enhances their perceived depth and tactile quality. This suggests a skilled application of the canvas effect—one that adds artistic character without sacrificing clarity. In art restoration or digital painting contexts, such a technique is used to simulate physical media while maintaining fidelity to original details. Therefore, the canvas texture serves its purpose effectively.",
