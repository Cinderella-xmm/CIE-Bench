    "Question": "Q1: Are the character’s eyes in Panel 1 clearly narrowed and intense, with visible tension in the eyelids and pupils, and is the hand gripping the katana properly aligned with five distinct fingers showing natural curvature?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 1 of Image B, the character's eyes are depicted with a strong sense of intensity. The eyelids are visibly narrowed, and the pupils are constricted, suggesting focus or determination—common visual cues in anime to convey emotional intensity. The eyebrows are slightly furrowed, adding to the expression of resolve. This aligns with typical anime stylistic conventions where facial features are exaggerated for emotional impact. Regarding the hand gripping the katana, the fingers are clearly defined, with five distinct digits shown in a natural, curved grip around the hilt. The thumb is positioned on one side, and the other fingers wrap around the handle in a realistic manner, consistent with proper sword-holding technique. There is no indication of clipping or unnatural alignment. Thus, both the eye expression and hand positioning meet the criteria for clarity and anatomical plausibility within the stylized medium.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Does the character’s leaping pose in Panel 2 show correct leg extension and arm positioning consistent with forward momentum, and do the fiery trails originate naturally from the hair strands without overlapping into solid parts of the body?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 2, the character is shown mid-leap with dynamic motion lines and a fiery trail behind her. Her legs are extended forward in a running or lunging motion, with the leading leg bent at the knee and the trailing leg stretched back, which is consistent with forward momentum. The arms are positioned appropriately—one forward, one back—to balance the movement. However, the fiery trails appear as abstract streaks that emanate from her hair, but they do not seem to originate cleanly from individual strands; instead, they blend into the background with some overlap near the torso. While the effect is visually dramatic, there is slight encroachment of the fire-like effects into the silhouette of the character’s lower body, particularly near the thigh area, which may suggest an artistic liberty rather than physical realism. Nevertheless, given the stylized nature of anime action panels, such effects are common. Overall, the pose is anatomically plausible for motion, but the fiery trails show minor overlap with the body, though not significantly enough to break immersion.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Is the katana in Panel 3 correctly oriented forward without clipping through the character’s uniform or distorting the sleeve, and are the surrounding energy swirls continuous and free of pixelated or broken lines?",
    "explanation": "In Panel 3, the katana is held firmly in the character’s right hand and is oriented diagonally forward, pointing toward the viewer. The blade does not clip through the sleeve of her uniform; instead, it appears to pass just outside the fabric, maintaining spatial coherence. The sleeve shows a natural fold around the wrist, indicating proper interaction between the weapon and clothing. The energy swirls surrounding the character are vibrant and colorful, forming a circular vortex effect behind her. These swirls are smooth and continuous, with no visible pixelation or broken lines. They enhance the sense of power and motion without introducing technical artifacts. Given the digital art style, the rendering quality is high, and the effects are seamlessly integrated. Therefore, both the weapon placement and energy effects meet the standards of clean, professional anime artwork.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Do the backgrounds in all three panels retain their original vibrancy and contrast without color bleed into the character’s outline or loss of sharpness in the bold borders around her figure?",
    "explanation": "Across all three panels in Image B, the backgrounds are highly saturated and feature vivid colors—reds, oranges, purples, and blues—that create strong contrast with the character. In Panel 1, the background is a gradient of magenta and orange, which does not bleed into the character’s face or hair outline. Panel 2 uses fiery orange and red tones, with motion lines that remain distinct from the character’s silhouette. Panel 3 combines swirling rainbow hues and blue energy patterns, both of which stay separate from the character’s edges. The outlines of the character are consistently sharp, with clear black borders defining her form. There is no visible color bleeding or softening of edges, even where bright light effects are present. This suggests careful layering and masking during digital composition. The preservation of contrast and edge clarity indicates high-quality rendering, consistent with professional anime-style illustrations.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5: Are the character’s head, torso, and limbs proportionally consistent across all three panels, with no stretching or compression that alters the original anatomy or causes misalignment between body parts?",
    "explanation": "The character’s proportions remain consistent across all three panels. In Panel 1, she is shown in close-up with a balanced head-to-body ratio, typical of anime design. Her facial features, including the eyes, nose, and mouth, are symmetrical and well-proportioned. In Panel 2, the full-body leap is captured with limbs extended, but the scale of the head relative to the torso and legs remains consistent with standard anime proportions (e.g., approximately 7–8 heads tall). The limbs are elongated for dramatic effect but not distorted—no unnatural stretching or compression is evident. In Panel 3, she is again shown in a dynamic pose, but her body maintains the same structural integrity, with no misalignment between joints or limbs. The sleeves and skirt also follow the expected flow based on body movement. Overall, despite dynamic poses, the character’s anatomy is preserved with minimal exaggeration, adhering to the established visual style without breaking proportional consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"
