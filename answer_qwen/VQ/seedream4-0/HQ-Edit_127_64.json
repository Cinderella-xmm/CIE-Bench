      "question": "Are the stylized seating icons positioned on the grass without overlapping or displacing real people or objects, and do they cast consistent shadows matching the sun's direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stylized seating icons are placed on the grass. They do not overlap with any real people or objects in the scene. The shadows cast by these icons appear consistent with the direction of the sun, which is high and slightly to the left, as indicated by the lighting on the Eiffel Tower and other elements. This consistency suggests that the icons were carefully positioned to integrate naturally into the scene.",

      "question": "Do the speech bubble graphics appear above or near walking figures without intersecting limbs or clothing, and are they proportionally sized relative to the human figures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The speech bubble graphics in Image B are located above and near walking figures. They do not intersect with limbs or clothing, maintaining a clear separation from the human figures. The size of the speech bubbles appears proportional relative to the scale of the people, ensuring they look natural and unobtrusive within the context of the image.",

      "question": "Is the camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette and does not exhibit distortion or edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The camera icon featuring the Eiffel Tower in Image B is correctly scaled and positioned so that its outline matches the tower's silhouette. There is no distortion or edge artifacts visible around the icon, indicating it was likely designed to blend seamlessly with the actual Eiffel Tower in the background.",

      "question": "Does the vertical split line align with the center of the pathway and extend consistently from foreground to background without cutting through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The vertical split line in Image B aligns with the center of the pathway and extends consistently from the foreground to the background. It does not cut through key structures like the Eiffel Tower or hedges, maintaining a clean division between the two halves of the image. This alignment ensures that the split line serves its purpose without disrupting important visual elements.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the cool green tones applied uniformly across the image without causing visible color banding, loss of detail in shadows, or unnatural saturation in the sky or leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The cool green tones applied across Image B are uniform and do not cause visible color banding. There is no loss of detail in shadows, and the sky and leaves retain their natural appearance without unnatural saturation. The overall effect enhances the image while preserving its original qualities.",
