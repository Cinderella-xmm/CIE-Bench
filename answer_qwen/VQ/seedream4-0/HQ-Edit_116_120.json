      "question": "Is the spherical glass dome transparent and smooth, with no visible seams, distortions, or incorrect light refractions affecting the sandcastle inside?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The spherical glass dome in Image B appears visually clear and uniformly transparent, allowing an unobstructed view of the sandcastle inside. There are no visible seams or cracks, which would typically be noticeable at the joints of a manufactured glass sphere. The surface is smooth, and reflections on the dome are consistent with how light interacts with a polished, curved glass surface—showing soft highlights and subtle distortion due to curvature, which is expected and natural. Importantly, there are no unnatural warping effects, chromatic aberrations, or refractive anomalies that would suggest digital artifacts or rendering errors. The internal structure of the sandcastle remains sharp and geometrically coherent, indicating that the dome does not introduce optical distortion. Based on these observations and general knowledge about glass domes in snow globes, this dome appears physically plausible and well-rendered.",

      "question": "Does the mahogany base have a natural wood texture and consistent thickness, and is it properly scaled to support the dome and sandcastle without appearing distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base in Image B is crafted from what appears to be polished mahogany, exhibiting a rich reddish-brown hue typical of fine hardwood. The surface shows subtle grain patterns and luster consistent with real wood finishes, though the level of detail may be slightly idealized. Its thickness is uniform across the perimeter, and its ornate carvings (such as scrollwork and fluting) are symmetrical and proportionally balanced. The base is sufficiently wide and sturdy to support the large spherical dome above it, both in terms of physical stability and visual balance. There is no evidence of compression, stretching, or scaling inconsistency between the base and the dome. From a design standpoint, such bases are commonly made with a slight taper for aesthetic appeal and structural integrity, which is observed here. Thus, the base appears both realistic and appropriately scaled.",

      "question": "Are the glittering grains evenly distributed and subtle enough to mimic sand texture without obscuring fine architectural details of the sandcastle?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The base layer beneath the sandcastle within the globe contains fine, glittery particles resembling sand. These particles are evenly spread across the floor of the globe and reflect light softly, creating a shimmering effect typical of decorative snow globes. However, their size and distribution appear carefully controlled—not so dense as to blur the edges of the sandcastle’s intricate features like arches, staircases, or spires. The sparkle enhances the beach theme without overwhelming the model. Given that snow globes often use glitter or fine beads to simulate environmental textures, this application is appropriate and artistically effective. The level of detail on the sandcastle remains clearly visible, suggesting that the glitter is used subtly and purposefully.",

      "question": "Are the seashells around the sandcastle clearly defined, appropriately small in scale, and free from pixelation or unnatural edge artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The seashells placed around the base of the sandcastle inside the globe are varied in shape and size but remain consistently small relative to the structure, which aligns with typical miniature diorama design. Each shell is sharply rendered with visible ridges, spiral patterns, and natural color gradients, indicating high-resolution modeling. There are no signs of jagged edges, aliasing, or pixelation, suggesting a clean digital render or high-quality photograph. Their placement appears deliberate and natural, contributing to the coastal theme without overcrowding. The lighting accentuates their form without causing overexposure or clipping. Overall, they are well-integrated into the scene and maintain visual coherence with the rest of the composition.",

      "question": "Is the ceramic plaque with “Empire of the Shores” inscribed clearly readable, properly attached to the base, and displaying a uniform matte pearl surface without glare or texture mismatch?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ceramic plaque located on the front of the mahogany base displays the text 'Empire of the Shores' in a classic serif font. The lettering is legible, centered, and evenly spaced, with no blurring or distortion. The plaque has a cream-colored, matte finish with a subtle pearlescent sheen, consistent with porcelain or glazed ceramic materials. It is securely affixed to the base with small decorative rivets on each side, suggesting proper attachment. There is no visible glare or reflection that would imply an overly glossy surface; instead, the texture matches the expected appearance of a handcrafted plaque. The material contrast between the dark wood and light plaque is harmonious and visually balanced. This suggests careful attention to detail in both design and rendering.",

      "question": "Is the matte pearl finish uniformly applied across the sandcastle and surrounding shells, with no areas showing excessive shine or reflection?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandcastle and surrounding seashells exhibit a consistent matte pearl finish, giving them a soft, luminous quality without harsh reflections. This finish mimics the look of carved ivory or polished shell, which is common in collectible figurines. The lighting in the image creates gentle highlights along curved surfaces and edges, but there are no specular hotspots or over-saturated glares that would indicate an uneven coating or incorrect material simulation. The overall tone remains subdued and cohesive, enhancing the delicate nature of the scene. Uniformity in texture and reflectivity is maintained across all elements, suggesting a well-executed material application. This is particularly important in product renders where realism depends on accurate surface properties.",

      "question": "Are all architectural elements of the sandcastle (towers, stairs, arches) intact and geometrically consistent, with no stretching, bending, or missing sections?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The sandcastle within the globe retains full structural integrity. All towers, turrets, staircases, archways, and decorative motifs are present and correctly proportioned. The symmetry of the castle is preserved, with mirrored elements on either side and consistent spacing between features. The spiral staircase and central entrance are clearly defined and follow logical architectural principles. There is no visible warping, stretching, or clipping of geometry, which could occur in poorly rendered 3D models. The perspective within the globe is accurately maintained, meaning that depth cues are correct and no parts appear flattened or misaligned. This suggests a high-fidelity digital reconstruction or physical model with precise craftsmanship. Even under magnification, the lines remain straight and the forms coherent.",
