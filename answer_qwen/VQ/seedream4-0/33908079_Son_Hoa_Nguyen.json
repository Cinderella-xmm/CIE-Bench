      "question": "Are the hands enlarged but still anatomically correct with five fingers, natural joint positions, and no distorted shapes?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the character are visibly larger in proportion to the body compared to typical human proportions, which suggests intentional enlargement for stylistic or illustrative effect. However, upon close inspection, both hands display five distinct fingers, with joints positioned naturally—such as knuckles and finger bends—that align with anatomical accuracy. The fingers appear symmetrical and correctly articulated, without any signs of distortion such as elongation, fusion, or unnatural angles. Despite their enlarged scale relative to the rest of the figure, the hands maintain a realistic structure consistent with human anatomy. This is common in stylized illustrations where exaggeration is used for emphasis while preserving fundamental realism. Therefore, although the hands are disproportionately large, they remain anatomically correct.",

      "question": "Are the green tones in the tea field vibrant yet consistent with natural plant colors, showing smooth gradients without abrupt shifts or artificial-looking patches?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tea field in Image B displays a range of green hues that are vibrant and visually appealing. The greens vary from light lime to deeper forest shades, which reflects natural variation found in real tea plantations due to differences in sunlight exposure, leaf maturity, and plant density. These color transitions are smooth and gradual, particularly across the rows of plants, indicating careful digital rendering to simulate natural lighting and depth. There are no visible abrupt color shifts or pixelated patches that would suggest artificial editing or low-quality rendering. The gradient flow mimics how light interacts with dense foliage in nature, creating a believable and aesthetically pleasing environment. Thus, the green tones are both vibrant and naturally consistent.",

      "question": "Does the gold foil effect on the sack’s logo appear as a smooth, reflective metallic layer without jagged edges, unnatural glare, or inconsistent lighting?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The logo on the sack in Image B features a circular design with a gold-colored element that simulates a foil finish. Upon examination, the gold area has a smooth, shiny surface with subtle highlights that suggest reflectivity, consistent with metallic materials. The edges of the gold circle are clean and well-defined, lacking jagged lines or pixelation. The lighting appears consistent with the overall scene's illumination—soft and diffused—so there are no harsh glares or specular reflections that would indicate overprocessing. The gold effect blends seamlessly into the illustration without disrupting the surrounding textures. This indicates a high-quality digital application of the foil effect, achieving a realistic and polished appearance.",

      "question": "Are the vine-patterned borders present along the edges of the image, following natural leaf and stem structures without overlapping or clipping into the main scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows a decorative border framing the central illustration, composed of delicate vine patterns with small leaves and stems. These elements are arranged symmetrically along all four sides of the image, forming a continuous, ornamental frame. The vines follow organic, flowing lines that mimic natural growth patterns, with leaves spaced realistically along thin stems. Importantly, the border does not intrude into the main scene; it remains cleanly separated from the illustrated content by a white margin. There is no evidence of clipping, overlapping, or misalignment between the border and the inner image. This careful design ensures that the decorative frame enhances rather than distracts from the central subject, maintaining visual harmony and aesthetic integrity.",

      "question": "Is the recycled paper texture applied uniformly across the entire image without obscuring fine details such as the worker’s hair, clothing folds, or tea leaves?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background of Image B appears to be an open book with a textured, aged paper surface resembling recycled or handmade paper. This texture is most prominent around the outer margins of the image, especially on the left and right edges, where the brownish, fibrous material is clearly visible. However, within the central illustrated panel, the texture is subtly blended or absent, allowing the detailed artwork—such as the individual strands of the worker’s hair, the folds in the green jacket, and the tiny leaves of the tea plants—to remain sharp and clear. The texture does not overlay or blur these fine details, suggesting that it was applied selectively to the page background rather than the illustration itself. This technique preserves the clarity of the drawing while giving the impression of a physical, tactile medium like a storybook. Therefore, the texture is uniform in its placement (on the paper) but does not interfere with the illustrative details.",
