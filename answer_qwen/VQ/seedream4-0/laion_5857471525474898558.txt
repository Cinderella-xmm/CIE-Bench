    "Question": "Q1: Are the LEGO-style bricks on the building facade uniformly sized, aligned in rows, and free from visible texture repetition or blurring?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the building facade is rendered to resemble LEGO bricks. Upon close inspection, the red and blue sections of the building show a consistent grid-like pattern typical of LEGO construction. The bricks appear to be uniformly sized and aligned in horizontal rows, with no noticeable misalignment or distortion. However, upon closer analysis, subtle texture repetition can be observed—especially in the red brick section where the same pattern of studs repeats across multiple bricks. This repetition is characteristic of digital textures used to simulate LEGO materials but may not perfectly mimic real LEGO bricks due to limitations in rendering resolution. There is no significant blurring, and the edges of individual 'bricks' are sharp. Therefore, while alignment and sizing are generally uniform, the presence of repeated texture patterns slightly undermines perfect realism.",
    "answer": "No"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the window frames appear as solid, blocky LEGO elements with consistent thickness and alignment, matching the original window positions and sizes?",
    "explanation": "The windows in Image B are stylized to look like LEGO elements. They maintain their original positions relative to the building’s structure, preserving the architectural layout seen in the original image. Each window frame appears as a solid, blocky shape with consistent thickness and clean edges, mimicking the appearance of LEGO pieces. The alignment of these frames matches the original window placements accurately. While minor discrepancies in scaling could exist due to the transformation into LEGO form, overall, they remain proportionally accurate and well-aligned. The use of white LEGO-like blocks for the frames gives them a cohesive, modular appearance without distortion or misplacement.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Do the green LEGO vines grow along the same vertical paths as the original plants, maintaining segmented, blocky forms without stretching or breaking continuity?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the green vines are constructed from LEGO-style segments that follow the same vertical trajectories as the original ivy in Image A. These vines are composed of stacked green LEGO-like bricks, forming a segmented, blocky structure that closely mirrors the natural growth pattern of the original plants. The segmentation is consistent, and there is no visible stretching or break in continuity along the length of the vines. Each segment appears to connect seamlessly to the next, maintaining a logical path up the building facade. While the organic curvature of real ivy is simplified into angular LEGO shapes, the overall direction and placement align with the original plant growth, indicating careful preservation of spatial relationships.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Are the gray LEGO railings on each balcony evenly spaced, horizontally aligned, and securely connected to the balcony base without floating or overlapping incorrectly?",
    "explanation": "The balconies in Image B feature gray LEGO-style railings that are consistently designed across all levels. These railings are horizontally aligned and evenly spaced, reflecting the modular nature of LEGO construction. Each railing is attached directly to the balcony base, appearing firmly connected without any floating or misaligned segments. There is no evidence of overlap between adjacent parts, nor do the railings extend beyond their intended boundaries. The design maintains structural coherence with the rest of the LEGO architecture, suggesting intentional and precise modeling. Given the consistency in spacing and attachment points, the railings appear properly integrated into the overall structure.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Is there a flat, level platform extending beneath the entire building base, positioned consistently with the sidewalk and not overlapping with parked vehicles?",
    "explanation": "Image B shows a flat, level platform at the base of the building that extends uniformly beneath the entire structure. This platform is consistent with the sidewalk level and serves as a foundation for the LEGO-style building. It does not intrude into or overlap with the parked vehicles, which remain clearly separated from the building base. The platform appears to be flush with the ground plane, maintaining proper spatial relationship with surrounding elements. This suggests that the digital transformation preserved ground-level alignment, ensuring realistic integration of the LEGO model into the urban environment.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do all architectural elements—including windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—remain in their original positions and maintain proper alignment and spacing relative to one another?",
    "explanation": "Comparing Image B to the original (Image A), all major architectural features—windows, doors, balconies, and rooflines—are preserved in their original positions. The transformation into LEGO style does not alter their relative placement or spacing. Windows retain their correct vertical and horizontal alignment, doors are located at the same entry points, balconies project outward at consistent intervals, and the roofline follows the original gabled design. Despite the change in material representation, the spatial hierarchy and proportions of the building remain intact. This indicates that the edit focused on stylistic reinterpretation rather than structural modification, maintaining architectural accuracy.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q7: Are there any visible seams, color bleeding, or sharp edges at the borders between the LEGO building and the sky, trees, or parked cars?",
    "explanation": "At the boundaries between the LEGO-style building and surrounding elements such as the sky, trees, and parked cars, there are no obvious seams or color bleeding. The edges of the LEGO structure are cleanly defined, with sharp transitions that suggest high-quality digital compositing. The integration of the LEGO facade with the non-LEGO elements (like the vehicles and foliage) appears seamless, with no visible artifacts or halo effects. Lighting and shadows also blend naturally, reinforcing the illusion of a unified scene. This suggests careful post-processing to ensure visual coherence between the stylized building and its environment.",
    "answer": "No"
