      "question": "Does the silk robe exhibit natural fabric texture with consistent gold highlights and floral patterns that follow realistic light interaction and material properties?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the silk robe appears to have a stylized and cartoonish design rather than realistic fabric texture. The gold highlights and floral patterns are consistent but lack the natural light interaction and material properties expected in real silk fabric. The visual cues suggest an artistic interpretation rather than a realistic depiction.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the book’s shape preserved with realistic page layers and depth, avoiding broken edges, inconsistent thickness, or floating components that disrupt its structural coherence?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The book in Image B has a shape that is preserved with page layers and depth, but it includes animated illustrations within the pages, which is not typical for a realistic book. There are no broken edges or inconsistent thickness, but the floating components (illustrations) disrupt its structural coherence in a realistic context.",

      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the bookshelf designs integrated without altering the original shelf alignment, spacing, or wood grain texture, maintaining visual credibility and structural rationality?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookshelf designs in Image B are integrated into the background but include additional decorative elements like tea-themed panels that were not present in Image A. These additions alter the original shelf alignment and spacing, affecting the visual credibility and structural rationality compared to a realistic setting.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the bookmark panels appear correctly inserted between the book’s pages, with proper scale, orientation, and connection to the book, avoiding floating or misaligned placement?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bookmark panels in Image B appear as part of the book's illustrated content rather than physical bookmarks inserted between pages. They do not exhibit proper scale, orientation, or connection to the book as would be expected in a realistic scenario, thus appearing as floating or misaligned elements.",
      "weight": 1,
      "model_answer": "No",
      "is_correct": false
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Are the facial features, particularly around the eyes and mouth, proportionally accurate and free from exaggerated or distorted shapes that compromise visual plausibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The facial features in Image B, particularly around the eyes and mouth, are proportionally accurate within the context of a cartoon-style illustration. However, they are exaggerated and stylized compared to realistic human proportions, which compromises visual plausibility when judged by standards of photorealism.",
