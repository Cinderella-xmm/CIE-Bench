      "question": "Are the metallic textures added to the camera body natural, maintaining the camera's structural coherence without visible artifacts or loss of detail?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the camera body is covered with metallic textures and steampunk elements such as gears and pipes. The integration appears intentional and stylistic, aligning with a steampunk aesthetic. However, these additions are not natural in the context of a real camera design; they disrupt the original structural coherence by introducing mechanical components that do not serve a functional purpose on a modern camera. There are no visible artifacts suggesting poor editing, but the overall effect is an artistic alteration rather than a natural one.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Does the lens maintain its original proportions and geometric shape, with metallic textures that appear authentic and undistorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lens in Image B retains its circular shape and proportions similar to a typical camera lens. The metallic textures applied to the lens, including the gear-like patterns, seem to be carefully integrated to preserve the lens's geometry. These textures contribute to the steampunk style while appearing authentic within this artistic context. Comparing with Image A, where the lens is smooth and lacks such textures, it is clear that the modifications are deliberate and well-executed for the intended style.",

      "question": "Do the tripod legs and head display metallic textures that are consistent with their original structure, avoiding damage to geometry or introduction of unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The tripod in Image B has been given a metallic, steampunk appearance with rusted textures and additional mechanical details. Despite these changes, the basic structure and geometry of the tripod remain intact. The alterations enhance the steampunk theme without distorting the tripod's form. In comparison to Image A, where the tripod is plain black, the metallic textures in Image B are consistent with the new artistic direction and do not introduce unnatural distortions.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are the Nikon logo and other text labels naturally integrated into the metallic design, remaining legible and consistent with the steampunk style without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The Nikon logo and other text labels in Image B are still visible and legible despite the metallic and steampunk transformations. They are integrated into the design in a way that fits the overall steampunk theme, with a slightly aged and weathered look that complements the surrounding metallic textures. This integration maintains consistency with the artistic style chosen for the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the lighting, shadowing, and reflection on the camera and tripod consistent and realistic within the steampunk illustration style, contributing to the image's natural appearance?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting, shadowing, and reflections in Image B are consistent with the steampunk illustration style. The light source seems to be coming from the same direction as in Image A, ensuring that shadows and highlights are coherent. The reflections on the metallic surfaces add to the realism of the steampunk design. While the overall appearance is stylized, the lighting effects support the natural look within the artistic context.",
