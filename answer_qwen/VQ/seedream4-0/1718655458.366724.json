      "question": "Are all spherical and cubic elements converted into LEGO brick shapes with consistent rectangular prismatic geometry, preserving structural integrity and avoiding warped or broken edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the objects are clearly composed of LEGO-like bricks arranged in a structured, tiered formation. The elements that were previously spherical or cubic in Image A (such as marbled spheres and blocks) have been replaced by uniformly shaped rectangular prisms resembling standard LEGO bricks. These bricks exhibit clean, sharp edges and consistent geometry—no warping, distortion, or fragmentation is visible. Each brick maintains a rectangular prismatic form, and their assembly follows a logical stacking pattern without any structural anomalies. This transformation preserves geometric integrity and aligns with the physical properties expected of LEGO bricks. Therefore, based on visual analysis and knowledge of LEGO design principles, the conversion is accurate and structurally sound.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the transformed LEGO bricks exhibit a uniform matte surface finish without specular highlights or reflections that contradict the intended LEGO material?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The LEGO bricks in Image B display a surface texture that mimics both matte plastic and marble patterns. While some bricks have a smooth, slightly reflective appearance due to the marble effect, this does not necessarily imply a glossy or specular finish. However, upon closer inspection, there are subtle highlights on the tops of the studs and edges of the bricks, which suggest a degree of reflectivity inconsistent with typical matte LEGO plastic. Real LEGO bricks are usually made from ABS plastic with a non-reflective, matte finish. The presence of these highlights, especially on the stud surfaces, indicates a more polished or semi-gloss surface than would be expected. Thus, while the overall appearance is close to LEGO aesthetics, the specular highlights contradict the intended matte material property.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are there visible, proportionally accurate interlocking features (e.g., studs or recesses) on the tops and sides of the LEGO bricks that match standard LEGO design?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B shows LEGO-style bricks with clearly defined studs on the top surfaces, arranged in a grid pattern typical of standard LEGO pieces. These studs are proportionally spaced and sized relative to the brick dimensions, matching the common 1x1, 1x2, or 2x2 configurations. Additionally, the side profiles of the bricks show recessed areas where interlocking would occur, consistent with LEGO's design for connection between pieces. The alignment and spacing of these features are accurate, suggesting that the bricks are designed to fit together like real LEGO components. Based on world knowledge of LEGO construction and visual confirmation in the image, the interlocking features are present and correctly proportioned.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Are all LEGO bricks arranged in a stable, grounded formation on a wooden shelf surface, with no floating or suspended pieces that defy gravity or spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the LEGO bricks are stacked in a stepped, pyramid-like structure resting entirely on a wooden shelf. The base layer is fully supported by the shelf, and each subsequent layer is built directly on top of the one below, forming a stable, grounded configuration. There are no visible floating elements or pieces suspended in mid-air. The arrangement follows gravitational and structural logic, with no overhangs or unsupported segments that would violate physical plausibility. The shadow beneath the structure further confirms contact with the surface. Therefore, the placement adheres to realistic spatial and physical constraints.",

      "question": "Is the background uniformly simplified into a clean, neutral tone without any residual textures, shadows, or depth cues that conflict with the minimalist intent?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is a plain, off-white or light gray wall with no discernible texture, pattern, or gradient. It lacks any shadows, depth cues, or environmental details that might distract from the subject. This simplicity aligns with a minimalist aesthetic commonly used in product photography or design presentations. Unlike Image A, which has a softly blurred, textured backdrop with ambient lighting and depth, Image B’s background is deliberately flattened and neutralized. There are no conflicting visual elements, and the lighting appears even and diffused, enhancing the clean look. This transformation supports the minimalist intent by eliminating distractions and focusing attention on the LEGO structure.",
