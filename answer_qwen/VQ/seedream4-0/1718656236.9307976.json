      "question": "Are the feathers on the headdress evenly distributed and symmetrically placed without appearing warped or misaligned?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the feathers on the headdress are arranged in a visually balanced manner. The distribution appears even, with no noticeable warping or misalignment. Each feather is positioned to create a symmetrical pattern around the headpiece. This conclusion is drawn from observing the alignment and spacing of the feathers relative to each other and the central axis of the headdress.",

      "question": "Do the woven textile patterns on the shoulder armor and neckpiece display uniformity and fine detail without visible seams or unnatural texture repetition?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The woven textile patterns on the shoulder armor and neckpiece in Image B exhibit a high level of uniformity and fine detail. There are no visible seams disrupting the continuity of the patterns, and the texture does not show any unnatural repetitions. The intricate designs appear consistent throughout, suggesting careful craftsmanship. This analysis is based on examining the texture and pattern consistency across the visible areas.",

      "question": "Are the layers of the necklace stacked in a way that follows gravitational and structural logic, with no turquoise elements appearing suspended or disconnected from the base?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The necklace in Image B is composed of multiple layers that seem to follow gravitational and structural logic. The turquoise beads and gold elements are integrated seamlessly into the design, with no parts appearing suspended or disconnected. The layering creates a natural flow, adhering to realistic weight distribution. This assessment is made by observing the necklace's structure and how it interacts with the wearer's neck.",

      "question": "Do the warm tones applied to the headdress, textiles, and jewelry match the lighting conditions and skin tone without creating unnatural color casts or shadows?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warm tones in Image B harmonize well with the lighting conditions and the skin tone of the subject. The colors of the headdress, textiles, and jewelry complement each other and the overall scene, without introducing unnatural color casts or shadows. The lighting enhances the richness of the warm tones while maintaining a natural appearance. This evaluation considers the interplay between light, color, and the subject's features.",

      "question": "Are the braids and earrings clearly visible and undistorted, with no stretching, clipping, or unnatural separation from the head or ears?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The braids and earrings in Image B are clearly visible and maintain their natural form. There is no evidence of distortion, stretching, or clipping. The braids flow naturally from the head, and the earrings hang correctly from the ears, indicating proper integration with the subject's features. This conclusion is reached by closely inspecting the positioning and appearance of the hair and jewelry.",
