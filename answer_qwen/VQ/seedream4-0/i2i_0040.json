      "question": "Are the textures on the bike frame and surrounding grass natural, without any visible artifacts or unnatural color variations?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the textures on the bike frame and surrounding grass appear stylized and simplified. The colors are uniform and lack the detailed variations typically seen in natural textures. This suggests that the image has been edited or created with a digital art style rather than being a photograph of a real scene. Therefore, the textures do not appear natural.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Do the wheels and frame of the bike maintain their correct proportions and geometry, avoiding any distortion or deformation?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The wheels and frame of the bike in Image B maintain their correct proportions and geometry. There is no visible distortion or deformation; the bike appears to be accurately represented in terms of its structural integrity and design. The proportions seem consistent with what one would expect from a real bicycle.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Is the background clean and free from distracting elements, preserving the natural scene and focusing on the bike without introducing unnecessary elements?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The background in Image B is clean and free from distracting elements. It features a simple, stylized depiction of a park-like setting with trees and grass, which complements the bike without introducing unnecessary details. This focus on the bike enhances the visual coherence of the image.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the lighting and shadows on the bike and the surrounding area look natural and consistent with the original environment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting and shadows in Image B do not look natural when compared to typical outdoor lighting conditions. The image appears to have a flat, even light distribution with minimal shadowing, which is characteristic of digital illustrations rather than photographs taken in natural environments.",

    {
      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the bike positioned naturally within the frame, maintaining visual coherence and plausibility without appearing out of place?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The bike in Image B is positioned naturally within the frame. It is placed on a bench in a manner that seems plausible and coherent with the environment depicted. The positioning does not appear out of place or awkward, contributing to the overall visual plausibility of the scene.",
