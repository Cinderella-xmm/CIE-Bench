      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the breakfast items — pancakes topped with strawberries and blueberries, a baguette, and a small vase with a daisy — are placed on a wooden table in front of the subject. These elements are positioned in a way that aligns with typical breakfast table arrangements, suggesting a natural and coherent composition. The objects are evenly spaced and do not overlap in a manner that would suggest digital placement issues. The overall layout maintains visual balance and does not disrupt the spatial logic of the scene. The background remains consistent, with soft lighting and shadows that extend across the table surface, reinforcing the integration of these objects into the environment. There is no visible misalignment or floating effect, which would indicate poor integration. Therefore, based on visual coherence and compositional harmony, the items appear to be seamlessly integrated.",

      "question": "Are the textures of the pancakes, berries, bread, and flower vase detailed and natural, without any visible artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pancakes in Image B display a golden-brown surface with subtle variations in color and texture that mimic real cooked pancakes, including slight browning and a soft, porous appearance. The berries (strawberries and blueberries) have smooth, glossy surfaces with realistic shading and highlights, indicating attention to detail in rendering. The baguette has a crusty exterior with a slightly cracked surface, consistent with baked bread. The flower vase is rendered with a matte ceramic texture, showing gentle reflections and surface imperfections that enhance realism. No obvious pixelation, jagged edges, or unnatural patterns are present. All textures appear consistent with high-quality 3D rendering techniques, and there are no visible artifacts such as blurring or ghosting. Thus, the textures are detailed and natural.",

      "question": "Does the lighting and shadow on the breakfast items and vase correspond naturally with the light source in the room?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in Image B appears to originate from a window on the left side of the frame, casting soft, warm light across the scene. This is evident from the direction of the shadows and highlights on the subject’s face, clothing, and the objects on the table. The pancakes, berries, and baguette cast subtle shadows toward the right, consistent with left-side illumination. The vase and flower also show directional shading that matches this light source. Additionally, the highlights on the coffee cup and the reflective surfaces of the berries align with the expected behavior of light in such an environment. The shadows are soft and diffused, suggesting ambient lighting through curtains, which is plausible given the background. There are no conflicting light directions or harsh shadows that would indicate inconsistent lighting. Therefore, the lighting and shadows are consistent with a single, natural light source.",

      "question": "Are the sizes and placements of the pancakes, berries, bread, and flower vase proportionate and physically logical within the scene?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pancake is placed centrally on a white plate, appearing appropriately sized for a single serving. The berries are clustered on top, matching their typical size relative to the pancake. The baguette lies next to the plate, slightly angled, and its length is proportionate to the table and other objects. The vase is small and sits near the edge of the table, holding a single daisy, which is a realistic scale for such a container. The spacing between objects allows for natural access and does not overcrowd the table. From a physical standpoint, the arrangement is plausible and follows common breakfast table layouts. There are no disproportionately large or small objects that would break immersion. Thus, the sizes and placements are proportionate and logically consistent with real-world physics.",

      "question": "Does the subject's hand holding the coffee cup maintain a natural pose and grip, without any distortion or unnatural shapes?",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The subject’s hands in Image B are shown gripping a dark mug with both hands. The fingers wrap around the handle and body of the cup in a relaxed, natural manner. The thumb and fingers are proportionally correct, with proper curvature and spacing. There is no evidence of stretching, clipping, or unnatural bending of joints. The positioning of the hands suggests a comfortable hold, consistent with how a person would typically carry a mug. The shadows and lighting on the hands further support the three-dimensional form, enhancing the sense of realism. While the style is cartoonish, the anatomy remains consistent with human proportions and movement. Therefore, the hand pose and grip are natural and free of distortions.",
