    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the seat cushion is constructed from LEGO bricks, and its surface is clearly composed of individual black LEGO brick layers. Each layer is uniformly sized and stacked in a grid-like pattern, consistent with standard LEGO construction. The transitions between the bricks are sharp and distinct, not smooth or blended, which means there are no gradients—instead, there are clear edges between each brick. The color is consistently black across all visible bricks, and there are no visible texture artifacts such as smudges or irregularities in shading. This matches the expected appearance of LEGO pieces, where surfaces are flat and modular. Therefore, while the layers are uniform and black, the lack of smooth gradients (which would imply blending) aligns with LEGO’s blocky aesthetic.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The backrest in Image B is made of horizontally aligned black LEGO bricks, forming a structure that follows the general contour of an office chair's backrest. The bricks are arranged in horizontal rows, and the spacing appears even throughout. There are no visible gaps between the bricks, and the alignment is consistent, maintaining the intended shape without misalignments. The curvature of the backrest is preserved through the layered stacking of bricks, which slightly curves to match the ergonomic design. Given that LEGO models often use such techniques to simulate curved forms using flat elements, this construction is plausible and well-executed. No irregular spacing or breaks in alignment are evident.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The armrests in Image B are rendered using LEGO pieces, specifically metallic silver-colored structural elements. They maintain a clean, angular design typical of LEGO constructions, with sharp edges and uniform finish. The curvature of the armrests is preserved through the use of bent or angled LEGO beams, which replicate the original chair’s form. The connection points appear intact and properly aligned, with no visible distortion. The silver finish is consistent across both armrests, suggesting a uniform material application. While real metal armrests may have smoother curves, LEGO’s engineering allows for close approximations using modular parts. Thus, the armrests are accurately represented in terms of form, finish, and structural integrity within the constraints of LEGO design.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The five wheels on the base of the chair in Image B are made of translucent gray material, which is characteristic of LEGO wheel designs. Each wheel has a visible internal structure resembling the typical LEGO axle and hub mechanism, including circular ridges and central holes. The wheels are consistent in size and evenly spaced around the star-shaped base, matching the symmetrical layout of a standard office chair. Their placement under the base is accurate, and they appear to be attached securely. This design is consistent with how LEGO models represent rolling components—using transparent or translucent pieces to simulate realism while retaining modularity. No discrepancies in size or position are observed.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The chair in Image B is placed on a flat, white tabletop surface that contrasts sharply with the darker floor seen in Image A. The surface is uninterrupted, with no visible seams, textures, or imperfections. Shadows are present but subtle and consistent with overhead lighting, indicating proper depth and alignment. There are no visual inconsistencies such as floating elements or mismatched planes that would suggest misalignment. The transition from the chair’s base to the table is smooth, and the table’s edge is cleanly defined. This suggests a deliberate studio setup designed to highlight the LEGO model, using a clean background and surface to emphasize the product. Therefore, the positioning on the tabletop is accurate and visually coherent.",
    "answer": "Yes"
