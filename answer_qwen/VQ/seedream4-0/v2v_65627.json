      "question": "Does the soft grey plush texture on the elephant's body appear natural and free of any obvious artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The grey plush texture on the elephant's body in Image B is highly detailed, with visible fiber-like patterns that mimic real fur. The texture appears consistent across the surface, with subtle variations in shading that suggest depth and volume, typical of high-quality digital rendering or photography of a plush toy. There are no visible pixelation, unnatural edges, or repetitive patterns that would indicate digital artifacts. The lighting interacts naturally with the texture, casting soft shadows and highlights that enhance the three-dimensional feel. This level of detail and realistic interaction with light suggests the texture is both natural and artifact-free.",

      "question": "Are the large velvety pink inner ears of the elephant structurally consistent and visually credible without any distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The inner ears of the elephant in Image B are rendered with a soft, velvety pink texture that appears uniform and consistent with the expected appearance of plush material. The shape of the ears is anatomically plausible for an elephant, with rounded outer edges and smooth curvature. There are no visible distortions such as warping, stretching, or unnatural creases. The lighting enhances the three-dimensionality of the ears, with gentle gradients and soft highlights that suggest a flexible, fabric-like surface. The transition between the pink inner ear and the grey outer ear is seamless, further supporting visual credibility.",

      "question": "Does the jaunty small yellow felt hat blend naturally with the elephant and retain its fine details without any loss?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The yellow hat in Image B is rendered with a fuzzy, felt-like texture that matches the style of the rest of the plush toy. It sits atop the elephant’s head in a way that is proportionally balanced and stylistically consistent with the character’s design. The hat retains fine details such as the slight fold at the brim and the soft, textured surface that mimics real felt. The color and texture blend well with the overall aesthetic of the plush, and there is no evidence of blurring, sharpening artifacts, or loss of detail. The lighting also interacts naturally with the hat, showing subtle highlights that reinforce its three-dimensional form.",

      "question": "Is the bright red and yellow ruffled collar visually plausible and free of any unnatural textures?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The ruffled collar in Image B features alternating red and yellow layers that resemble fabric with a slightly stiff, ruffled structure, consistent with a costume accessory. The texture appears smooth and layered, with folds that follow natural draping patterns. There are no signs of pixelation, unnatural sheen, or inconsistent shading that would suggest digital artifacts. The colors are vibrant but not oversaturated, and the lighting creates soft shadows within the folds, enhancing realism. The collar’s placement and shape are consistent with a theatrical costume, and it integrates seamlessly with the rest of the character’s design.",

      "question": "Do the warm, soft spotlight and the weathered wooden stage enhance the overall authenticity and natural appearance of the image without causing any disruption?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The warm spotlight in Image B creates a focused illumination on the elephant, casting soft shadows and highlighting its features in a way that mimics stage lighting. This enhances the theatrical ambiance and draws attention to the character, contributing to a sense of depth and realism. The wooden stage beneath the elephant shows visible grain, scratches, and wear, which add to the authenticity of the scene. The lighting interacts naturally with the stage surface, creating realistic reflections and shadows. There are no harsh transitions, overexposed areas, or artificial-looking effects that would disrupt the scene. The combination of lighting and environment supports a cohesive, believable setting.",
