    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the cheetah figures are finished in gold and appear smooth with reflective surfaces. There are no visible textures or patches that suggest digital artifacting. The uniformity of the gold finish across both figures indicates a high-quality rendering without any unnatural disruptions. This conclusion is drawn from observing the consistent sheen and lack of pixelation or irregularities on the surface.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The translucent green-tinted glass façade in Image B has clean, continuous edges and realistic light transmission. There are no abrupt transitions or distortions at its boundaries, suggesting a well-executed design. The light passing through the glass appears natural, maintaining the integrity of the material's properties as expected in real-world objects.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The text 'Savanna Essence' is clearly visible on the base of both cheetah figures in Image B. It is correctly positioned, rendered with sharp edges, and maintains a consistent font style. There is no blurring or misalignment, indicating precise placement and high-quality rendering of the text.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The cheetah figures in Image B maintain their original sitting posture and anatomical proportions. Their limbs and torso show no signs of elongation, compression, or deformation. The transformation to a gold finish does not alter their physical structure, preserving their realistic appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "The two golden cheetah figures in Image B are symmetrically aligned with the central glass façade. They cast consistent shadows that match the lighting direction and surface reflection, contributing to a cohesive and realistic composition. The alignment and shadowing enhance the symmetry and visual balance of the scene.",
    "answer": "Yes"
