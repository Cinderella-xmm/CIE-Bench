      "question": "Do the edges and contours of the stapler maintain their smoothness without any jagged or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the stapler is shown from two angles—front and back—side by side. The edges of both views appear clean and well-defined, with no visible pixelation, jagged lines, or abrupt breaks in the contour. The curves and corners are smoothly rendered, consistent with a high-quality 3D render or professional product photography. The surface appears uniformly curved and polished, which aligns with typical design expectations for modern staplers. There are no visual artifacts such as aliasing or clipping that would suggest digital distortion. Therefore, based on visual inspection and common standards for object rendering, the edges maintain smoothness.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the blue color and metallic finish of the stapler consistent across both the front and back views with no visible texture discrepancies or artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The blue color of the stapler in both views is uniform in hue and saturation, suggesting a consistent material application. The glossy finish reflects light similarly in both views, with specular highlights appearing logically positioned according to the light source (likely from above and slightly in front). The metallic components, such as the hinge and base plate, show consistent reflectivity and tone across both views. There are no noticeable differences in texture, shading, or glossiness between the two sides, which would indicate rendering inconsistencies. This consistency supports a coherent 3D model or high-quality image editing process where materials were applied uniformly. Thus, the color and finish appear consistent.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the mechanical components such as screws and hinges depicted accurately and consistently between the two views, avoiding any illogical positioning or distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In the front view, the hinge mechanism and staple channel are clearly visible, showing a gold-colored metal strip and a small screw near the base. In the back view, a similar screw is visible on the upper part of the stapler’s body, which corresponds to the pivot point of the top lever. The placement of these components is anatomically accurate for a standard stapler design—hinges are typically located at the rear for leverage, and screws secure structural elements. Both views depict these parts in logical positions relative to the overall structure. There is no misalignment, floating components, or distorted proportions. The symmetry and placement align with real-world stapler mechanics, indicating accurate representation.",

      "question_id": "Q4",
      "question": "Do the shadows and highlights on the stapler match the lighting conditions in both views, ensuring a believable three-dimensional effect?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The lighting in both views appears consistent, with soft highlights along the top surfaces and gentle gradients on the sides, suggesting a single directional light source from above and slightly to the front. Shadows are cast beneath the stapler and slightly toward the back, which is physically plausible given the assumed light direction. In both views, the reflection patterns on the glossy blue surface and metallic parts are aligned with this lighting setup. For example, the highlight on the top of the stapler's arm is mirrored in both views, and the shadow under the base follows the same curvature. This coherence in lighting cues enhances the three-dimensionality and realism of the object, confirming that shadows and highlights are consistent and believable.",

      "question": "Is the layout of the stapler's side-by-side views clear and uncluttered, with no distracting or misplaced elements disrupting the visual flow?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The two views of the stapler are placed symmetrically on a circular green platform, with adequate spacing between them to avoid overlap. The composition is balanced, with both views clearly visible and oriented to showcase different aspects of the object—front and back. There are no extraneous objects, text, or graphical elements that distract from the main subject. The background is uniform and muted, enhancing focus on the stapler. The clean separation and alignment contribute to a professional presentation style often used in product visualization. This layout ensures clarity and visual harmony, supporting effective communication of the object’s form.",
