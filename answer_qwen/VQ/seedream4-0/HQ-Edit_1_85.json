      "question": "Are the lace details on the blouse rendered with consistent texture and edge definition, avoiding jagged or artificial-looking patterns that break from realistic fabric behavior?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the lace details on the blouse are rendered in a stylized, paper-cut art form. The edges of the lace are sharp, clean, and geometrically precise, consistent with the overall aesthetic of layered paper art. While this style is not realistic in terms of fabric behavior—real lace would have softer, more organic textures and subtle imperfections—the rendering is internally consistent within the artistic medium. There are no jagged or artificial-looking patterns; instead, the design follows a deliberate, symmetrical, and uniform pattern typical of intricate paper cutouts. Therefore, within the context of the artwork's intended style (paper art), the lace details maintain consistent texture and edge definition, even though they do not mimic real-world fabric behavior.",

      "question": "Does the enlarged violin maintain correct proportions and undistorted structural elements such as the scroll, bridge, and f-holes, without visible warping or stretching?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The violin in Image B is depicted in a stylized paper-cut aesthetic. Despite the artistic abstraction, the key structural elements—the scroll, bridge, and f-holes—are present and proportionally accurate relative to each other and to the body of the violin. The scroll is elegantly curved, the bridge is upright and correctly positioned, and the f-holes are symmetrically shaped and placed. Although the violin appears slightly larger in scale compared to the girl’s body due to the artistic emphasis, there is no visible warping, stretching, or distortion of its components. The proportions adhere to the general anatomy of a violin, even if exaggerated for stylistic effect. Thus, within the constraints of the artistic style, the violin maintains correct proportions and structural integrity.",

      "question": "Are the fingers on both hands correctly positioned and shaped, with no extra digits or distorted joints, maintaining natural human anatomy?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the hands of the girl are rendered in a paper-art style, which simplifies forms but still attempts to convey anatomical correctness. Both hands show five fingers each, with appropriate spacing and curvature. The left hand positions the violin with the thumb and fingers wrapped around the neck, while the right hand holds the bow in a manner consistent with violin playing technique. The joints appear smooth and articulated, without extra digits or unnatural bends. Although the fingers are stylized and lack fine skin texture or shading, their shape and positioning reflect natural human anatomy. There are no visible distortions such as missing or extra fingers, nor are there joint abnormalities. Given the artistic medium, the representation remains anatomically plausible.",

      "question": "Is the overall surface texture consistent across the image, with no mismatched areas showing sudden changes in lighting, gloss, or material quality that suggest poor layer blending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B employs a cohesive paper-cut art style throughout, where all elements—including the girl, violin, table, candlestick, and background—are constructed from layered, flat surfaces with uniform matte textures. Lighting is soft and directional, casting subtle shadows that enhance depth without introducing inconsistent gloss or reflections. There are no abrupt transitions between materials or lighting conditions; every object shares the same visual language of crisp edges and uniform surface finish. Even the musical notes in the background are integrated seamlessly into the texture of the backdrop. This consistency suggests careful layering and alignment, with no signs of poor blending or mismatched textures. The entire composition feels unified in both style and surface quality.",

      "question": "Do all foreground elements (girl, violin, table, candlestick) maintain consistent depth and placement, avoiding floating or misplaced components that disrupt spatial logic?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the foreground elements—the girl, violin, table, and candlestick—are arranged with clear spatial hierarchy. The girl is centrally positioned, with the violin held close to her body, suggesting proper physical interaction. The table is placed to her right, at a plausible distance and height, supporting the candlestick and books. The candlestick sits firmly on the table surface, and the shadows cast by the objects align with the light source, reinforcing depth and grounding. There are no elements floating in mid-air or misaligned with expected perspective. The layered paper style enhances the sense of depth through overlapping planes, and all components are logically positioned within the scene. Thus, the spatial logic is preserved, and there are no misplaced or floating elements.",
