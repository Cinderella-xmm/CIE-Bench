      "question": "Does the cake’s icing display bold, graphic patterns that are evenly distributed and free from distorted textures or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the cake's icing is rendered in a highly stylized, pop-art aesthetic. The surface of the cake features bold, graphic patterns composed of thick, contrasting lines and dots, typical of halftone or comic book art styles. These patterns are evenly spaced and consistent across the cake's surface, with no visible distortion or broken lines. The design uses sharp, clean edges and uniform repetition, which aligns with the characteristics of graphic art. This contrasts with realistic icing textures, which would show smoother gradients or irregularities. Based on visual analysis, the icing appears to be intentionally stylized rather than realistically textured, and all elements are intact and well-defined.",

      "question": "Are the balloons represented as uniform monochrome dots that maintain their original spherical form and clustered grouping without geometric distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the balloons are depicted using a halftone dot pattern, where each balloon is filled with dense, uniform dots that create a monochrome appearance. Despite this stylistic treatment, the balloons retain their spherical shape and are grouped together in a cluster similar to the original arrangement. There is no evidence of geometric distortion—each balloon maintains its roundness and proportional size relative to others. The use of dots does not compromise the overall form; instead, it enhances the graphic quality while preserving spatial relationships. This technique is common in pop art to simulate texture and shading without realism.",

      "question": "Have the table and vase been converted into solid, contrasting color blocks with sharp, clean edges and no residual textures or blending artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, both the table and the vase have undergone significant stylistic transformation. The table is rendered as a flat, bright yellow block with sharp, clean edges and no gradient or texture, characteristic of pop-art style. Similarly, the vase is simplified into a solid blue shape with defined contours and no visible surface details like glaze or brushwork. There are no blending artifacts or soft transitions—everything is sharply delineated. This conversion into solid color blocks with high contrast and clean outlines is consistent with the overall artistic intent of the image, which prioritizes graphic clarity over realism.",

      "question": "Does the candle flame feature exaggerated sharp lines and bright hues while remaining attached to the wick and showing an upward directional flow without floating or misalignment?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The candle flame in Image B is clearly stylized with exaggerated, sharp triangular lines and vibrant orange and red hues, typical of comic book or pop-art depictions of fire. It is firmly attached to the wick, with no signs of floating or detachment. The flame points upward, indicating correct directional flow, and its form is symmetrical and consistent with expectations of a stylized flame. Although not physically accurate, the representation adheres to visual conventions used in graphic illustrations to convey motion and heat. There is no misalignment with the candle or surrounding elements.",

      "question": "Are all edited elements positioned consistently within the scene’s depth and perspective, with no floating or misplaced components relative to the table and background?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, despite the abstract and stylized nature of the artwork, all elements maintain a coherent spatial relationship. The cake sits properly on the cake stand, which is placed on the table. The balloons are anchored above the table, appearing to float naturally from strings that extend downward. The vase, chopsticks, and small bowls are all positioned on the table surface and aligned with the plane of the table. The background buildings and foliage, though simplified, provide a consistent depth cue. No objects appear to float independently or violate the established perspective. Even though the style is non-realistic, the composition preserves logical spatial hierarchy and alignment.",
