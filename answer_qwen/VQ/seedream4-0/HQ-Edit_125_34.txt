    "Question": "Q1:",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the brass gears and levers on the desk appear to be well-aligned with the desk's structure. They are positioned in a way that suggests they are part of the desk's design, with no visible floating or misshapen geometry. The material seams look natural, as if the gears and levers were crafted from the same material as the desk. This conclusion is drawn by observing the integration of these elements with the desk's surface and their alignment with other features like the drawers and carvings.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q2:",
    "explanation": "The modified books in Image B display glowing effects that seem consistent without distorting their page edges. The light appears to emanate from within the books, giving them a luminous quality. There is no noticeable light bleeding into surrounding surfaces, which would indicate poor integration. The glow seems contained within the boundaries of the books, suggesting careful editing to maintain realism.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q3:",
    "explanation": "The holographic globe above the monitor in Image B is clearly visible with proper depth and transparency. It appears to float above the desk, casting subtle shadows and reflections that enhance its three-dimensional appearance. These visual cues suggest that the hologram has been edited with attention to detail, ensuring it interacts naturally with the environment around it.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q4:",
    "explanation": "The newly added ornate frames around the windows in Image B are seamlessly integrated with the existing window structure. They follow the contours of the windows without overlapping glass panes or creating distorted perspective lines. The frames enhance the aesthetic appeal of the windows while maintaining a cohesive look with the rest of the room's design.",
    "answer": "Yes"
}

{
    "Question": "Q5:",
    "explanation": "All edited elements in Image B share consistent lighting and shadow behavior. The gears, glowing books, hologram, and window frames all interact with light in a manner that avoids abrupt changes in brightness or material properties. This consistency suggests that the editing process took into account the overall lighting conditions of the scene, resulting in a harmonious blend of new and existing elements.",
    "answer": "Yes"
