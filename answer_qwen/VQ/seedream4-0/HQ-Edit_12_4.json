      "question": "Does the glass dome enclosing the pocket watch and fabric exhibit clear, smooth transparency with realistic light refraction and reflection, without visible distortion or jagged edges?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The glass dome in Image B appears to have clear, smooth transparency. The light refraction and reflection are realistic, as the edges of objects within the dome are sharp and not distorted. There are no visible jagged edges or distortions that would suggest a lack of realism. The visual cues such as the clarity of the pocket watch and books under the dome support this conclusion.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the miniature leather-bound books and quill placed around the watch at a consistent scale relative to the pocket watch and fabric, and do they rest naturally on the surface without appearing suspended or distorted?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The miniature leather-bound books and quill around the watch in Image B appear at a consistent scale relative to the pocket watch and fabric. They rest naturally on the surface without any signs of suspension or distortion. Their placement and size seem proportionate to the other elements within the scene, indicating a natural integration.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Do the leather-bound books display earthy and vibrant colors (such as deep browns, ochres, or burgundies) that harmonize with the original fabric tone, and is the golden embroidery on the fabric continuous, finely detailed, and free of artificial shine or broken lines?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The leather-bound books in Image B display earthy colors like deep browns and burgundies, which harmonize well with the maroon fabric tone. The golden embroidery on the fabric is continuous and finely detailed, with no artificial shine or broken lines. The color harmony and detail level suggest a high-quality presentation.",

        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The pocket watch in Image B is preserved with its intact geometric form, visible engraved patterns, and consistent metallic reflections. There is no deformation or loss of fine detail due to its integration into the new scene. The watch's appearance maintains its original characteristics, suggesting careful editing.",

        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The texture of the maroon fabric with red and gold embroidery in Image B is consistently sharp and unbroken throughout. Under and around the glass dome, there are no blurred areas, repeating patterns, or unnatural smoothing. The fabric's texture remains uniform, indicating a high-quality image edit.",
