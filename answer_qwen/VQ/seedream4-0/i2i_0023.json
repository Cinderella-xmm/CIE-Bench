      "question": "Are the enlarged head of the boy and the shrunken birds proportionate and structurally coherent, avoiding any noticeable distortion?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the boy's head appears significantly larger in proportion to his body compared to typical human anatomy. This exaggeration is a stylistic choice common in cartoon or caricature art, where heads are often enlarged for expressive effect. However, despite this enlargement, the facial features—such as the eyes, nose, and mouth—are still anatomically plausible and symmetrically placed, maintaining structural coherence. The birds, on the other hand, appear smaller than they would be in real life relative to the boy, but their proportions to each other remain consistent with their species (e.g., the macaw is larger than the budgie). While the size discrepancy between the boy and birds is intentional and stylized, it does not introduce anatomical distortions within individual elements. Therefore, although the overall proportions are exaggerated, they are internally consistent and do not exhibit unnatural warping or stretching.",

      "question": "Do the block colors used for the boy's skin tone and feather textures appear clean and uniform, without introducing unnatural artifacts?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The boy's skin tone in Image B is rendered using flat, solid blocks of color with smooth transitions between areas like cheeks, forehead, and neck. There are no visible gradients, noise, or pixelation that would suggest digital artifacts. The use of rosy cheeks adds a stylized touch but remains consistent with cartoon aesthetics. Similarly, the feathers of the birds are depicted with clean, uniform color fills—green and yellow for the macaw, white for the cockatoo, blue for the budgie, and yellow for the canary. These colors are applied evenly across the shapes, with minimal texture variation, which aligns with vector-style illustrations. There are no signs of dithering, blurring, or jagged edges within the colored regions. The uniformity suggests high-quality digital rendering rather than low-resolution or poorly processed imagery.",

      "question": "Are the white outlines around the boy and birds smooth and consistent, without jagged edges or unnatural breaks?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The white outlines in Image B define the contours of the boy and all four birds. These lines are consistently thick and follow the natural curves and edges of the figures. Upon close inspection, the outlines are smooth and continuous, with no abrupt changes in thickness or direction. Even at complex junctions—such as where the macaw’s wing meets the boy’s shoulder or where the cockatoo perches on the boy’s head—the outline maintains integrity without breaking or appearing pixelated. The presence of a transparent background further emphasizes the crispness of these borders, suggesting that the image was likely created or exported using vector graphics or high-resolution rasterization techniques. The absence of aliasing or stair-stepping effects indicates careful rendering.",

      "question": "Do the shrunken birds retain their fine details and textures naturally, without losing clarity or appearing pixelated?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Despite being visually smaller in scale due to the artistic style, the birds in Image B preserve key identifying features such as eye shape, beak structure, and feather patterns. For example, the macaw has distinct black markings around its eye and a gradient from green to yellow along its body, while the cockatoo retains its curved crest and gray beak. The small blue bird (budgie) and yellow canary also have defined eyes and beaks. However, because the illustration uses simplified forms and block colors, fine textures like individual feather strands are not present. This simplification is intentional and typical of cartoon styles, where detail is sacrificed for clarity and visual appeal. Importantly, there is no pixelation or blurriness; the edges are sharp, and the colors are clean. Thus, while the level of realism is reduced, the clarity and legibility of the birds' forms are preserved.",

      "question": "Does the composition with the enlarged boy's head and shrunken birds appear balanced and neatly arranged, providing visual credibility?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The composition in Image B places the boy centrally, with the birds positioned symmetrically around him—one on each shoulder and two above his head. The enlarged head draws immediate attention, which is a common technique in cartoon art to emphasize expression. The birds are spaced evenly and do not overlap in a way that causes visual clutter. Their placement feels intentional and harmonious, contributing to a sense of balance. Although the proportions are exaggerated, the arrangement follows a logical spatial hierarchy: the largest figure (the boy) anchors the scene, and the birds are distributed in a way that complements rather than overwhelms. The transparency background removes distractions, allowing the viewer to focus on the central subject. While the scene is not realistic, it maintains visual coherence and aesthetic appeal, making it credible within the context of stylized illustration.",
