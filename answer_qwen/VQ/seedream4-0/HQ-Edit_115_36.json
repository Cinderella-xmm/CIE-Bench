      "question": "Is the golden title banner positioned at the top of the image without overlapping or distorting the cat’s head or the window frame, and does it have a natural metallic sheen that matches the ambient light?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The golden title banner in Image B is positioned at the top center of the image, above the cat and the window frame. It does not overlap or distort any part of the cat’s head or the window structure, maintaining a clear separation between the graphic element and the main subject. The banner exhibits a metallic sheen with subtle highlights and shadows that suggest a three-dimensional form, consistent with ambient lighting from the window behind the cat. The light appears to come from the upper left (as indicated by the soft illumination on the cat's fur and the window), and the banner reflects this directionality with gentle gradients and specular highlights, contributing to a natural appearance. This alignment and material rendering are consistent with polished digital art styles used in character cards or collectible game assets.",

      "question": "Is the nameplate located at the bottom of the image without intersecting or deforming the cat’s tail or the wooden floor, and does it have clean edges and consistent material texture?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The nameplate at the bottom of Image B is placed centrally along the lower edge of the frame, just above the wooden floor. It does not intersect or deform the cat’s tail or the floor surface; instead, it sits cleanly beneath the cat, preserving spatial continuity. The edges of the nameplate are sharp and well-defined, with no jaggedness or blurring. The material texture appears consistent—metallic with slight embossing and rivet details—matching the overall aesthetic of the frame and banner. The lighting on the nameplate also aligns with the scene’s ambient light, showing subtle reflections and shading that suggest depth without visual artifacts. This placement and design reflect careful composition typical of high-quality digital illustrations.",

      "question_id": "Q3",
      "question": "Are the stat bars clearly visible and positioned without overlapping the cat’s fur or the window, and do they use a font and color scheme that match the overall polished, soft 3D art style?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The stat bars in Image B are located on the left side of the image, outside the primary visual space occupied by the cat and the window. They do not overlap the cat’s fur or the window frame, ensuring clarity and avoiding visual clutter. Each bar is clearly labeled with attributes such as 'Agieity,' 'Curiscity,' and '(Charm),' using a clean, legible font that complements the semi-realistic 3D style. The color scheme—orange, green, and blue for the bars—matches the vibrant yet soft tone of the artwork. The text and bars have smooth edges and consistent transparency levels, indicating professional rendering. The design integrates well into the overall aesthetic without disrupting the realism of the scene, suggesting intentional stylistic harmony between UI elements and the background art.",

      "question": "Does the metallic trim form a complete, continuous border around the image without gaps, misaligned corners, or unnatural reflections that contradict the lighting direction?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The metallic trim in Image B forms a complete, continuous border around the entire image. The corners are precisely mitered with spherical accents at each corner, and there are no visible gaps or misalignments. The reflections on the trim follow the directional lighting from the window, showing subtle highlights on the upper-left edges and softer shadows on the lower-right, which matches the light source in the scene. The material has a consistent brushed-metal texture with realistic specular response, reinforcing the illusion of depth and physical presence. There are no unnatural distortions or inconsistent reflections that would contradict the lighting direction. This level of detail suggests high-quality digital compositing and attention to material physics.",

      "question_id": "Q5",
      "question": "Is the overall image rendered in a consistent semi-realistic 3D style where the cat’s fur, window details, and added elements like the banner and stat bars all exhibit smooth textures and no pixelation, blurring, or geometric distortions?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Image B maintains a consistent semi-realistic 3D artistic style throughout. The cat’s fur is rendered with fine detail, showing individual strands, soft volume, and realistic lighting effects that simulate natural hair texture. The window frame and glass panes are crisp and geometrically accurate, with reflections and refractions that match the outdoor environment. Added elements like the banner, stat bars, nameplate, and metallic frame are seamlessly integrated, exhibiting smooth textures and no pixelation or blurring. The overall image lacks geometric distortions, such as warped lines or stretched features, and all components appear proportionally balanced and visually coherent. This consistency indicates a high-quality rendering process where both original and added elements were designed to harmonize within the same visual language.",
