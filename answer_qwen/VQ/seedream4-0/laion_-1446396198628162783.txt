    "Question": "Q1: Are the newly added mission control elements (such as consoles, screens, or panels) geometrically consistent with the room's perspective and do not appear to float or clip through surfaces?",
    "explanation": "In Image B, the background has been replaced with a mission control room environment featuring multiple monitors, control panels, and consoles. These elements are arranged in a way that follows a consistent vanishing point perspective, aligning with the astronaut’s position in the foreground. The depth cues—such as overlapping displays and diminishing size of screens toward the back—are coherent with typical architectural perspective rules. There is no visible clipping where the consoles intersect with the astronaut or floor, and the elements appear anchored to the ground plane. The lighting direction from the ceiling lights in the original image (Image A) was likely preserved in the editing process, contributing to a believable integration. However, since the entire background is synthetic, it relies on digital rendering accuracy. Given the smooth alignment and absence of floating or misaligned components, the added mission control elements maintain geometric consistency.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q2: Do the color-coded sections for training stages (e.g., Physical Training, Technical Skills) have clean edges and are they positioned so they do not overlap or obscure the astronaut’s suit or feet?",
    "explanation": "The four color-coded boxes (blue, green, orange, purple) are placed in the foreground, layered over the lower half of the image. They are evenly spaced and aligned horizontally across the bottom third of the frame. Each box has sharp, clean edges, suggesting digital vector graphics were used. Critically, none of the boxes extend into the astronaut’s body or feet; they are positioned just below the suit, leaving clear space between the astronaut’s boots and the top edge of the boxes. This ensures that the astronaut remains fully visible and unobstructed. The placement appears intentional to avoid visual interference while still conveying information effectively. Based on visual inspection, there is no overlap with the suit or limbs.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q3: Are the illustrative icons (e.g., treadmill, simulator) proportionally sized and placed at appropriate distances from the astronaut so they do not appear oversized or misplaced in the scene?",
    "explanation": "The icons within each color-coded section (e.g., treadmill, astronaut figure, etc.) are stylized line drawings, not photorealistic objects. Their size is consistent with standard infographic design conventions—small enough to fit within the bounds of their respective boxes without dominating the layout. They are centered within each box and do not intrude into adjacent areas. Since they are symbolic rather than 3D-rendered objects, they do not need to adhere to physical scale relative to the astronaut. However, their positioning respects spatial hierarchy: they are clearly separate from the astronaut and do not appear to be physically interacting with or attached to the suit. There is no distortion or unnatural scaling that would suggest misplacement. Thus, despite being illustrative, their proportions and placement are appropriate for an infographic context.",
    "answer": "Yes"

    "Question": "Q4: Is the explanatory text for each training stage clearly readable, properly aligned, and not overlapping with the astronaut’s body or suit components?",
    "explanation": "Each color-coded box contains a title (e.g., 'Physical Training') and a short paragraph of descriptive text beneath it. The text is legible, with sufficient contrast against the colored backgrounds. The font size is uniform and appropriately scaled for readability. All text blocks are aligned centrally within their respective boxes and remain within the boundaries of the graphic elements. Importantly, the text does not extend beyond the edges of the boxes or encroach upon the astronaut’s legs or suit. The astronaut’s feet are visible and unobscured, and no part of the text overlaps with any portion of the suit. This careful layout ensures clarity and avoids visual clutter, maintaining focus on both the astronaut and the informational content.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q5: Are the astronaut’s suit joints (e.g., elbows, knees), gloves, and helmet fully intact with no visible distortion, warping, or missing texture details?",
    "explanation": "The astronaut’s suit in Image B retains the same structural integrity as in Image A. The joints at the elbows and knees show natural articulation without stretching or warping, indicating that the image editing process preserved the original contours. The gloves are properly shaped and aligned with the hands, showing no signs of deformation. The helmet maintains its spherical shape and clear visor alignment. Texture details such as seams, zippers, and fabric folds are consistent with those in the original image. There is no evidence of pixelation, blurring, or missing parts that would suggest damage during compositing. The suit appears to have been carefully masked and integrated into the new background without altering its physical appearance.",
    "answer": "Yes"

{
    "Question": "Q6: Do the shadows cast by the added mission control elements (e.g., consoles, icons) align with the direction of the original ceiling lighting and do not contradict the existing shadow patterns on the floor and astronaut?",
    "explanation": "In Image A, the original lighting comes from overhead fluorescent fixtures, casting soft, even illumination with minimal directional shadows. In Image B, the background has been replaced with a digitally rendered mission control room. While this new environment includes artificial lighting effects (e.g., blue glow from screens), the actual shadows on the astronaut and floor remain unchanged from the original photo. Notably, there are no new shadows cast by the added consoles or icons onto the floor or astronaut, which would be expected if they were real 3D objects in the scene. This suggests that the added elements are flat overlays without proper 3D depth or shadow simulation. As such, the shadows do not align with the original lighting direction—they are absent entirely where they should be. This creates a visual inconsistency because realistic integration would require shadows that match the light source. Therefore, the lack of corresponding shadows contradicts the lighting logic of the original scene.",
    "answer": "No"
