      "question": "Does the dancer’s raised leg and arm maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment despite the stylized design, with no visible geometric distortion or unnatural bending?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "In Image B, the dancer's raised leg and arm appear to maintain natural human proportions and joint alignment. The stylized design does not introduce geometric distortion or unnatural bending. The leg is bent at a plausible knee angle, and the arm is extended in a manner consistent with human anatomy. The joints and limbs are proportionate relative to the body, suggesting careful attention to realistic human form despite the artistic style.",

      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Are the patterns on the dancer’s dress and accessories composed of smooth, continuous lines and uniform color segments without jagged edges or fragmented areas indicating texture errors?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The patterns on the dancer’s dress and accessories in Image B are composed of smooth, continuous lines and uniform color segments. There are no jagged edges or fragmented areas that would indicate texture errors. The stained-glass effect contributes to this by creating clean, defined shapes within each segment of the pattern.",

      "question": "Do the huts and trees in the background exhibit smooth, curved forms consistent with Art Nouveau aesthetics, without distorted silhouettes or collapsed geometry?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The huts and trees in the background of Image B exhibit smooth, curved forms that align with Art Nouveau aesthetics. The silhouettes are well-defined and lack any distorted or collapsed geometry. The curves of the trees and the rounded shapes of the huts contribute to an organic, flowing appearance typical of Art Nouveau design.",

      "question": "Is the color gradient across the sky and ground consistent with a soft, iridescent glass effect, showing no harsh boundaries or artificial highlights?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The color gradient across the sky and ground in Image B is consistent with a soft, iridescent glass effect. There are no harsh boundaries or artificial highlights disrupting the flow of colors. The transition between hues is smooth, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the stained-glass style.",

      "question": "Does the hand holding the cloth display five fingers with natural spacing and curvature, and does it interact realistically with the fabric without clipping or floating?",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "The hand holding the cloth in Image B displays five fingers with natural spacing and curvature. It interacts realistically with the fabric, as the fingers appear to grip the material without any clipping or floating effects. The positioning of the hand and its interaction with the cloth suggest a careful consideration of realism within the artistic medium.",
